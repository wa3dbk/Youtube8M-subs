00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and I knew I had to cut out a lot of the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.380 
and I knew I had to cut out a lot of the
body<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.920> order<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.489> room<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> tires

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
all-terrain tires I knew I wasn't going

to get the best traction possible and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.980 
to get the best traction possible and
the<00:02:00.539> dry<00:02:00.780> stuff<00:02:01.310> but<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.850> damp<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.450> can

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the dry stuff but when it's damp I can

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
the dry stuff but when it's damp I can
give<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.409> rest<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.310> trucks<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.670> run<00:02:05.850> for

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
give the rest of the trucks a run for

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449 
give the rest of the trucks a run for
the<00:02:06.149> money<00:02:06.179> with<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.229> takes<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> jumps

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the money with this it takes the jumps

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.210 
the money with this it takes the jumps
nicer<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:09.899> rubber<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
nicer because you have more rubber to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.400 
nicer because you have more rubber to
land<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:14.130> seems<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.640> corner<00:02:15.090> better

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
land on and it seems to corner better

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.339 
land on and it seems to corner better
through<00:02:16.410> some<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.860> corners<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:18.349> not

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
through some of the corners to not

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.229 
through some of the corners to not
rolling<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.819> got<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> wider

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
rolling as much as you got a wider

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.309 
rolling as much as you got a wider
stance<00:02:21.569> obviously<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.880> overall<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.780> really

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
stance obviously so overall I really

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.710 
stance obviously so overall I really
like<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> said<00:02:26.910> I've<00:02:27.150> taken<00:02:27.420> back

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
like it and like I said I've taken back

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750 
like it and like I said I've taken back
to<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.930> track<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.319> i<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.950> i<00:02:29.069> will<00:02:29.310> continue

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to the track and i think i will continue

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.360 
to the track and i think i will continue
to<00:02:30.079> you<00:02:31.079> know<00:02:31.200> there<00:02:31.530> isn't<00:02:31.769> much<00:02:31.920> difference

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
to you know there isn't much difference

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.580 
to you know there isn't much difference
between<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.819> original<00:02:33.140> sc10<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.440> race

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
between the original sc10 and the race

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.490 
between the original sc10 and the race
back<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.190> except<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:36.420> race<00:02:36.630> back<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.200> came

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
back one except the race back one came

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
back one except the race back one came
with<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> brushless<00:02:38.160> motor<00:02:38.579> setup<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.269> to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
with a brushless motor setup in it to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.120 
with a brushless motor setup in it to
begin<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:40.380> got<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> little<00:02:40.709> heavier

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
begin with it's got a little heavier

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.940 
begin with it's got a little heavier
front<00:02:41.489> axles<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.299> newer<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.590> it's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
front axles on the newer one and it's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.860 
front axles on the newer one and it's
got<00:02:44.130> hex<00:02:44.400> hubs<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.940> back<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.420> basically

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
got hex hubs on the back but basically

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.930 
got hex hubs on the back but basically
the<00:02:46.049> trucks<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.500> same<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:49.700> 2009<00:02:50.700> we

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the trucks the same so this is a 2009 we

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.840 
the trucks the same so this is a 2009 we
got<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.359> we've<00:02:51.720> been<00:02:51.900> running<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.290> hard<00:02:52.850> up

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
got this we've been running it hard up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.849 
got this we've been running it hard up
until<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.389> year<00:02:54.450> I've<00:02:54.780> kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.260> retired<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
until this year I've kind of retired it

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.160 
until this year I've kind of retired it
like<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> said<00:02:56.549> I'm<00:02:56.790> bringing<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> fact<00:02:57.389> i<00:02:57.630> love

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
like I said I'm bringing the fact i love

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.900 
like I said I'm bringing the fact i love
it<00:02:58.319> i<00:02:58.440> love<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.829> set<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.130> love<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.670> way<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
it i love the set up love the way it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.440 
it i love the set up love the way it
looks<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.329> are<00:03:00.389> proline<00:03:00.930> revolver<00:03:01.680> wheels

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
looks these are proline revolver wheels

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.430 
looks these are proline revolver wheels
and<00:03:03.450> i'm<00:03:04.350> sure<00:03:05.660> they<00:03:06.660> make<00:03:06.900> them<00:03:07.139> for<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and i'm sure they make them for the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.170 
and i'm sure they make them for the
newer<00:03:07.620> trucks<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.730> could<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.030> them

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
newer trucks as well you could get them

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.030 
newer trucks as well you could get them
for<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.420> race<00:03:09.630> back<00:03:09.900> st<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.530> probably<00:03:10.859> get

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
for the race back st you probably get

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.580 
for the race back st you probably get
the<00:03:11.160> 2.2<00:03:11.700> s<00:03:11.910> or<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.660> four<00:03:12.900> wheel<00:03:13.049> drives<00:03:13.319> now

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the 2.2 s or the four wheel drives now

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.150 
the 2.2 s or the four wheel drives now
too<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:15.109> guess<00:03:16.109> it'd<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.350> another<00:03:16.620> whole<00:03:16.889> class

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
too I guess it'd be another whole class

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
too I guess it'd be another whole class
a<00:03:17.190> modified<00:03:17.850> short<00:03:18.180> course<00:03:18.420> class<00:03:18.769> i'll<00:03:19.769> have

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
a modified short course class i'll have

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.120 
a modified short course class i'll have
to<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.340> catches<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.620> anyway<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:23.069> for

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
to see catches on anyway that's it for

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.910 
to see catches on anyway that's it for
now<00:03:23.370> take<00:03:23.700> care
