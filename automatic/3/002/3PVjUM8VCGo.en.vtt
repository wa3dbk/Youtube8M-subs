00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
sigilyph is easily the biggest threat

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900 
sigilyph is easily the biggest threat
that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> watch<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.520> smeargle<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that I have to watch out for smeargle is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.400 
that I have to watch out for smeargle is
going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> pain<00:00:51.539> getting<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.989> hazards

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
going to be a pain getting up hazards

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
going to be a pain getting up hazards
and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.770> sand<00:00:53.100> /<00:00:53.340> can't<00:00:53.730> break<00:00:54.000> spiritomb<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and then sand / can't break spiritomb so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.410 
and then sand / can't break spiritomb so
I<00:00:55.110> smeargle<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.399> rocks<00:00:56.789> along<00:00:57.090> with

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I smeargle does get up rocks along with

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
I smeargle does get up rocks along with
spikes<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> find<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> give

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
spikes I have to find some way to give

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920 
spikes I have to find some way to give
it<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> spiritomb<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> wrap<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> know

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it a spiritomb so I can wrap it to know

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.869 
it a spiritomb so I can wrap it to know
where<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> hazards<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.160> sigilyph<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
where the hazards then if sigilyph is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
where the hazards then if sigilyph is
costing<00:01:03.870> power<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.290> combine<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> allow<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
costing power or combine and I allow to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
costing power or combine and I allow to
set<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> lose<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.570> Rotom<00:01:06.990> cut<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.409> has

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
set up and I lose my Rotom cut which has

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920 
set up and I lose my Rotom cut which has
trick<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.220> sigilyph<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
trick for sigilyph then that thing is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
trick for sigilyph then that thing is
going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> sweep<00:01:10.409> me<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:11.010> Harry<00:01:11.310> Yama<00:01:11.549> could

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
going to sweep me then Harry Yama could

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
going to sweep me then Harry Yama could
definitely<00:01:12.180> become<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.869> big<00:01:13.229> problem<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
definitely become a big problem if I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
definitely become a big problem if I
lose<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.369> slowking<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
lose my slowking so I really have to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
lose my slowking so I really have to
watch<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.159> yet<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
watch out for that but yet with that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
watch out for that but yet with that
let's<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.390> started<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.200> seeing<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.650> he

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
let's get this started so seeing that he

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.960 
let's get this started so seeing that he
doesn't<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.189> ground-type<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.790> gonna<00:01:20.909> be

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
switch because 10 times out of 10

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
switch because 10 times out of 10
smeargle<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.259> always<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.860> straight<00:01:28.920> for

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
smeargle will always go straight for

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
smeargle will always go straight for
spore<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> both<00:01:30.509> switch<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.110> entei

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
spore so I both switch into my entei

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
spore so I both switch into my entei
which<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:31.860> sleep<00:01:32.189> talk<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.670> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
which has sleep talk and I'm going to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.490 
which has sleep talk and I'm going to
take<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.420> opportunity<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
take this opportunity to go for the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530 
take this opportunity to go for the
sleep<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.220> entei<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.759> faster<00:01:36.509> than

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
sleep time because entei is faster than

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
sleep time because entei is faster than
smeargle<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.619> guess<00:01:37.799> he<00:01:37.920> predicts<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
smeargle and I guess he predicts this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
smeargle and I guess he predicts this
and<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.700> switches<00:01:38.909> into<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> Kabutops<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and he switches into the Kabutops as I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
and he switches into the Kabutops as I
still<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.310> amount<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.939> damage

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
still get off a good amount of damage

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.630 
still get off a good amount of damage
with<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:42.840> times<00:01:43.110> resisted<00:01:43.710> blur<00:01:44.369> boots

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
with the four times resisted blur boots

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
with the four times resisted blur boots
which<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.119> goes<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> show<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:45.750> powerful

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
which just goes to show you how powerful

which just goes to show you how powerful
answer<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> choice<00:01:47.670> man<00:01:47.880> Adam<00:01:48.360> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
answer is with the choice man Adam in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
answer is with the choice man Adam in
nature<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.320> pretty<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
nature so pretty to him to go for a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
nature so pretty to him to go for a
sword<00:01:50.549> dance<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.000> waterfall<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> end<00:01:52.259> up

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
sword dance or a waterfall I end up

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
sword dance or a waterfall I end up
switching<00:01:52.560> directly<00:01:53.100> into<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.520> real<00:01:53.729> time<00:01:53.909> as

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
switching directly into my real time as

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
switching directly into my real time as
he<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> waterfall<00:01:55.229> he's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
he does go for the waterfall he's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.230 
he does go for the waterfall he's
actually<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.100> leave<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.490> his<00:01:56.579> Kabutops<00:01:57.090> or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
actually gonna leave in his Kabutops or

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually gonna leave in his Kabutops or
fodder<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> found<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.110> very<00:01:58.200> odd<00:01:58.829> but

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
fodder which I found to be very odd but

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
fodder which I found to be very odd but
then<00:01:59.369> again<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.390> only<00:02:00.600> real<00:02:00.750> reason<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
then again the only real reason you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950 
then again the only real reason you
needed<00:02:01.439> Kabutops<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.969> keep<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.420> ante<00:02:03.780> in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
needed Kabutops is to keep my ante in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.510 
needed Kabutops is to keep my ante in
check<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> being<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> sleep<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
check and with it being put to sleep I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.709 
check and with it being put to sleep I
guess<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:05.790> thought<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.240> didn't<00:02:06.540> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
guess he thought that he didn't really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
guess he thought that he didn't really
need<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:08.009> he<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.429> able<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
need it so this way he will be able to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.979 
need it so this way he will be able to
get<00:02:08.759> switch<00:02:08.940> initiative<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.690> bring<00:02:09.899> him

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
get switch initiative as I bring him

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050 
get switch initiative as I bring him
likes<00:02:10.170> Cavalier<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> bring<00:02:11.910> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
likes Cavalier he does in to bring in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
likes Cavalier he does in to bring in
the<00:02:12.150> smoogle<00:02:12.390> which<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.780> guess<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> dump

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the smoogle which I guess was a dump

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
the smoogle which I guess was a dump
on<00:02:13.650> my<00:02:13.830> part<00:02:14.070> but<00:02:14.370> getting<00:02:15.120> british<00:02:15.360> miracle

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
on my part but getting british miracle

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.240 
on my part but getting british miracle
is<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.350> good<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
is really good for me because now I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
is really good for me because now I
prevents<00:02:17.730> him<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:17.880> me<00:02:18.060> ending<00:02:18.240> up<00:02:18.360> any

prevents him from me ending up any
possible<00:02:19.410> layers<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.860> spikes<00:02:20.100> as<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:20.910> brings

possible layers of spikes as he brings

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
in the sigil if I'm gonna predict him to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.800 
in the sigil if I'm gonna predict him to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
go for the cost power so i switch

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
go for the cost power so i switch
directly<00:02:25.230> into<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.500> Rotom<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.100> no<00:02:26.280> he

directly into my Rotom but no he

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
of Draco meteor damage I would be able

to bring an nth a and even if I pulled

flare<00:03:22.530> blitz<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.860> him<00:03:22.980> having<00:03:23.190> thick<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:23.640> I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
flare blitz and him having thick but I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.830 
flare blitz and him having thick but I

would still be able to knock him out

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
would still be able to knock him out
although<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.620> way<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.190> am<00:03:26.610> able<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.940> bring<00:03:27.150> in

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
although this way I am able to bring in

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.850 
although this way I am able to bring in
sand<00:03:27.540> /<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.080> know<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.530> switch<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
sand / and I know that the switch and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.770 
sand / and I know that the switch and
spirit<00:03:29.220> team<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.459> way<00:03:29.670> too<00:03:29.730> obvious<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
spirit team is way too obvious so I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.300 
spirit team is way too obvious so I
predict<00:03:31.170> them<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.350> stay<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.860> go<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
predict them to stay in and I go for the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.740 
predict them to stay in and I go for the
rabbit<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.730> anyways<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.330> gets<00:03:33.480> off<00:03:33.600> a

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
rabbit to in anyways as it gets off a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.509 
rabbit to in anyways as it gets off a
good<00:03:33.930> amount<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.200> damage<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> ice<00:03:35.250> punch

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
good amount of damage with the ice punch

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.250 
good amount of damage with the ice punch
and<00:03:35.760> then<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.239> am<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.630> going<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.140> go

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and then I am then going to just go

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.300 
and then I am then going to just go
straight<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.739> earthquake<00:03:38.070> because<00:03:38.160> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
straight for the earthquake because I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.949 
straight for the earthquake because I
know<00:03:38.370> him<00:03:38.640> more<00:03:38.790> likely<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.330> gonna<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:39.690> bring

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
know him more likely is gonna now bring

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.140 
know him more likely is gonna now bring
in<00:03:40.110> spiritomb<00:03:40.560> because<00:03:41.310> sandslash<00:03:41.760> can

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
in spiritomb because sandslash can

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.240 
in spiritomb because sandslash can
literally<00:03:42.630> not<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.110> anything<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.709> spiritomb

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
literally not do anything to spiritomb

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.580 
literally not do anything to spiritomb

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
take any unnecessary damage and I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.130 
take any unnecessary damage and I
predict<00:03:50.730> them<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.970> go<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.480> bullets<00:03:51.959> but

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
predict them to go for the bullets but

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.660 
predict them to go for the bullets but
it<00:03:52.260> turns<00:03:52.410> out<00:03:52.560> these<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> calm<00:03:53.489> mind

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
it turns out these actually a calm mind

it turns out these actually a calm mind
very<00:03:53.940> dispiriting<00:03:54.209> which<00:03:54.540> means<00:03:54.780> if<00:03:54.930> i<00:03:55.440> lose

that can knock out that spiritomb so I

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.020 
that can knock out that spiritomb so I

than the sigilyph but yeah I just have

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.950 
than the sigilyph but yeah I just have
to<00:06:35.370> make<00:06:35.490> this<00:06:35.669> a<00:06:35.729> whole<00:06:36.060> lot<00:06:36.090> more<00:06:36.449> difficult

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
to make this a whole lot more difficult

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.629 
to make this a whole lot more difficult
for<00:06:36.990> me

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
for me

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.309 
for me
luckily<00:06:37.939> though<00:06:38.150> he<00:06:38.300> doesn't<00:06:38.509> have<00:06:38.780> calm<00:06:39.050> mind

luckily though he doesn't have calm mind
and<00:06:39.590> eventually<00:06:40.280> slowking<00:06:40.789> will<00:06:41.030> be<00:06:41.150> able<00:06:41.240> to

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
and eventually slowking will be able to

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.239 
and eventually slowking will be able to
beat<00:06:41.539> sigilyph<00:06:41.960> one-on-one<00:06:42.560> just<00:06:42.830> because<00:06:43.069> as

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
beat sigilyph one-on-one just because as

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.700 
beat sigilyph one-on-one just because as
you<00:06:43.340> can<00:06:43.370> see<00:06:43.520> scald<00:06:44.030> is<00:06:44.270> at<00:06:44.419> 3k<00:06:44.870> oh<00:06:44.900> and<00:06:45.590> with

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
you can see scald is at 3k oh and with

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.619 
you can see scald is at 3k oh and with
him<00:06:45.889> being<00:06:46.069> paralyzed<00:06:46.610> he<00:06:46.849> can't<00:06:47.120> flinch<00:06:47.419> me

him being paralyzed he can't flinch me
to<00:06:47.749> death<00:06:47.930> and<00:06:48.169> if<00:06:48.740> he<00:06:48.860> does<00:06:49.069> create<00:06:49.310> me<00:06:49.460> I<00:06:49.699> will

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
to death and if he does create me I will

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.029 
to death and if he does create me I will
be<00:06:50.330> faster<00:06:50.779> than<00:06:50.810> him<00:06:50.990> allowing<00:06:51.620> me<00:06:51.710> to<00:06:51.830> slack

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
be faster than him allowing me to slack

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.890 
be faster than him allowing me to slack
off<00:06:52.219> before<00:06:52.550> he<00:06:52.639> gets<00:06:52.669> off<00:06:52.969> more<00:06:53.240> prior<00:06:53.449> damage

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
off before he gets off more prior damage

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.719 
off before he gets off more prior damage
so<00:06:54.319> ends<00:06:54.499> up<00:06:54.620> realizing<00:06:54.919> that<00:06:55.219> he's<00:06:55.370> fighting

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
so ends up realizing that he's fighting

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.459 
so ends up realizing that he's fighting
a<00:06:55.969> losing<00:06:56.300> battle<00:06:56.479> and<00:06:56.840> he's<00:06:56.990> going<00:06:57.139> to<00:06:57.289> end<00:06:57.379> up

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
a losing battle and he's going to end up

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:59.260 
a losing battle and he's going to end up
running<00:06:57.650> and<00:06:57.919> that's<00:06:58.370> going<00:06:58.550> to<00:06:58.669> be<00:06:58.849> the<00:06:59.060> two

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
running and that's going to be the two
