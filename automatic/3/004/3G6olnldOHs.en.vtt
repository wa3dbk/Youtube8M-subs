00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.580
 here there are very good we are in this 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.950
 advice video to upload 3 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.810
 This is how I will explain to you how 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.210
 is that there is what it is for and with what 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.650
 purpose really and good first what 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.780
 what we have to do now to be able 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.189
 to be is to take us to help us to leave 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.300
 the websites so that they overcome this 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.880
 because right now we have both 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.849
 was expelling and good is that it is 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.619
 mainly serves to be able to do 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.029
 a much bigger pressure when 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.669
 we want to achieve some objective of a 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.419
 tower a dragon or things in general 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.189
 apart also what we do is 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.230
 we force the enemy team to go to 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.030
 have to stop that wave to that site by 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 so we can move forward to his 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.420
 movement because if we know that the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.670
 enemy team is going to form a wave 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.890
 like this one of top is to stay comes to be 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.230
 form a web like this one that right now 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 is top and then when there is a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 back so there's always something that's going to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 form not because when it's good it's going to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.580
 age farm always always always 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.810
 and will go through these sites here and it will be 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.790
 the time to hunt him in the world that 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.290
 see disease then what we want 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.750
 do is before you stake the lines 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.190
 it would not always be very interesting to do 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.260
 would be to skirt this entire area of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.370
 here from the board the first thing to see 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 when can it be when the team 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.240
 nerves doing rotations in these 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 parts of here from the board this is where 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 I'm painting here I should be 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.780
 by vices and ways but it does not leave me 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.399
 and good for this age the first thing that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100
 we need would be that the nine 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.219
 were matched in what comes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219
 being 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.049
 to see with this that it was a web what 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 we try is to make the wave is 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.899
 ok is right now is wave is is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.969
 is staying for the enemy is worth 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.340
 because it is closer to the towers 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.109
 enemies and then their webs arrive 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.969
 before and a very 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.170
 big of enemy videos then yes 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.810
 us what we want is to install 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.369
 this website to put pressure in between 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.170
 what we would do would be we would have here 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.200
 but we would not put all if you 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.479
 we would use a little bit we will leave it such and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.009
 as it is right now and quickly we 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.920
 we would go now what I'm going to do is see 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.049
 until what tree and I will highlight everything 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 now we are running out of nothing 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.970
 more what we will do now is see 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.110
 for this war, she deals devoutly what 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.680
 we have done it has been good in really 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.140
 he has not left it until how good if 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520
 we want to be in 6 against 6 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 the bugs for what we would do would be 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.600
 load them only the back rankings the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.130
 that adds a franchise back and already 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680
 they would leave a line that way 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.030
 we would touch nothing more and that line and little 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 little one is going to go is staying there is a 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.959
 web of a million website is every time 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.940
 bigger that will do that after 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.380
 when we want to rotate in between 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.959
 to top we have here two websites well 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.390
 ready to go then what 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.100
 it's been this one is good for before 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.319
 of going to join the team once 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 you're already in mid to achieve space in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.440
 mind put the whole web as to that 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730
 everyone that is always 6 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.830
 vito the six myths are formed and they leave 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.569
 you have to stop only three of 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.519
 behind 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.010
 as we have done before on this website and 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.659
 quickly we would go then what 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 we get that way is now here 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.040
 a web is being formed from a web 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.680
 of billion is quite large 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.610
 that is good to play although I know that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.590
 of the issues 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.570
 us while we see we could be 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.920
 medium top would be forming a web 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.210
 then what we will form in this way 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.330
 is to be here in half five against 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.800
 hit five at the time 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.720
 we want at the moment that the team 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.340
 enemy clean is wave us 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.490
 we can quickly make the rotation at 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.160
 or enter here save your entire case 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.230
 stop the guayaquil and then 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.700
 quickly go to top with all this 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.050
 good wave and we also see that down 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.970
 when we have left it before it is down 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.280
 created because it is also being formed in 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.680
 and thus waters at the time 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.620
 we rotate here with this wifi is very much 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.450
 easier and put the tower and pull 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.070
 the towers really or also what 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.930
 we could get would be if we imagine 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.670
 that we are going to go to the round because this 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.020
 plane elevation to dragon then you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 it is much more interesting to leave the line of 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.860
 and thus being built up 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.840
 good wifi top so then the butt 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.940
 enemy the stone to do something else 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.350
 because if you do this right now for 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.150
 sew this fixed towers that the strip 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.320
 let's have a good wave imagine 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.570
 what do you do the radar that the rotation 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.730
 being a team and you are the five 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.830
 people with this piece wave and you have 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.420
 Advantage in the game when taking advantage 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.160
 in the game and enter a tower of 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.790
 tier 2 with a web is so big 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.739
 practically 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.269
 but it is that apart they not only opened to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.409
 boris so big in top but in boat 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.750
 we are seeing how I would do right now 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.239
 in front it has again very large that 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.769
 they would have to defend then this is 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.509
 what comes to be this create the niches 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.639
 basically comes to be for 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.110
 try to force things before getting together 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.850
 the five in between if you're going to join 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.199
 with the team and you will be five in 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.020
 medium what you 're interested in is always 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.360
 before staking the two lines in the 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.590
 which are not going to join good 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.910
 mainly if you like that fed up 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.380
 middle pivot is very complicated up 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.389
 stay because they are a day much shorter 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.030
 and there is not this curve that you come so much 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.650
 here normally and good basically is 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.570
 that and also what I recommend 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.830
 very much is that save your jungle for 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.720
 to be able to see the moment that the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.160
 rotations for you thinking that if 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.409
 these five others are here in the middle 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.749
 merging 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.159
 you have already been and you are going to make a 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.219
 rotation with which we have done before 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.029
 that we have taught the enemy team 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.129
 quickly when you see that you are going to 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.599
 top will go through here will not go to give 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.489
 the whole round but it's going to go through 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.349
 this area here and it's time 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:08.209
 perfect to enter rest imagine 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.249
 that you have one I saw that you have something then 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:12.319
 you keep this and you can quickly 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.019
 zoom in on pop beams and come forward for 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.489
 back pim pim and you kill them all and so 

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.259
 is how this game is really played 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.849
 lcs this is something that is done 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.649
 there is constantly the difference between 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.479
 good equipment and bad equipment 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:24.769
 we followed each other very well when 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.259
 put and when not when they left 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.300
 you will hear is when you notice the most 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.099
 difference and good basically that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.279
 so you know this as concepts in 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.139
 singular that you know that in the webs in 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.119
 if they are equalized by williams 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.329
 or imagine that there are six means 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:43.009
 enemies and six allied means then in 

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:45.829
 If the cities were 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.169
 webs would win the web things would boost to 

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:50.449
 favor of the wave that was closest 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.060
 of its link therefore if it is a web of 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.000
 six videos here 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.830
 and six Serbian media here allies like 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.470
 that is wave is closer to our 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.720
 nexus the wifi goes up from super million it 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.639
 would create in favor of this side of things 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.980
 I would end up watching a web of super videos 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.070
 in this tower is here but if in 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.930
 change there are more minions or equal there 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.540
 the videos there are six blue videos and 6 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.040
 thousands purple and the wef is in this area 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.080
 here is 30 of study now 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.910
 then the web of super videos good 9 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.470
 super videos but the web is left 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.050
 would form towards this tower from here towards 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.610
 this side of someone because what is said is 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.710
 simply because the web 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.270
 Allied then arrives before and then the 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.310
 soccer they do before and in that way 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.660
 it works and well nothing I hope that this is 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.130
 could have served to understand a little 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.750
 what it means until they 've seen that 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.400
 many times people in the videos will 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.250
 ask what does this 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.540
 because when I eat and well then 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.220
 mainly what you have to do in mid 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.990
 that go from juntaros you have to try 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.880
 stake to then be able to make a
