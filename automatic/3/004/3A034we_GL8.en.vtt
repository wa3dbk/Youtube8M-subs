00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.280
 Hey, guys, beauty on the road. 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.050
 A video of you from the country. 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.230
 and this time it just bringing a new 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.440
 analysis of the channel analysis of who you 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.750
 ask me about joão alves de assis more 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.970
 known as the game the player who is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.980
 playing very well in real life in 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.490
 Brazilian team in the Minas Gerais athletics 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.230
 sure also in the ultimate fifa 11 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.870
 so let's go to the analysis soon 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.399
 good if you follow this channel there 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 long time you should know that I 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.140
 I'm very much a fan of jô 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.979
 in fifa since fifa 12 more or less 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.469
 good but despite being the player I 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.210
 more like to play he still has some 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.839
 defects that I have to speak about in this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.530
 video 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:54.949
 first if you want to use 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.760
 fifa 13 try to buy the orange and not 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.579
 The normal 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.010
 the normal game really bad with me in fifa 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.109
 13 I was extremely disappointed 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 with him so if you want to play whose 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.659
 I get orange and it's not too expensive to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.799
 me this very positive attribute and is a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.219
 orange letter costs only 25 mi and 26 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.109
 a thousand or so then it's a very 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.340
 legal and very considerable for many 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.289
 beauty people 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.520
 Good guys, what do I have to talk to? 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.829
 this guy 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.399
 if you get in the area with it with the 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:32.960
 Left leg and you push ball 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:36.950
 guesses it's a goal that the kick off the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.500
 area is too bad I do not know why but 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.439
 the kick from outside the area is simply 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.390
 horrible I can not score 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.490
 outside the area as far as 30 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 meters with him which is a shame because 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.439
 He kicks very hard, only 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 unfortunately outside the area and kick is not 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.219
 pronounced 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.740
 something else I found in it 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.409
 it was a kick and it 's very bad 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.049
 still a kick put do not try to do 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.899
 this gets the bicuda closes the eye is the part 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.179
 Ready ball kicks in but it's logical 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.319
 try to make it close to the goal like me 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 said a kick 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.249
 their long distance are very bad 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.950
 beauty 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:18.920
 Let's put the other attributes of Joe to 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.590
 his strength is simply fantastic he 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 can push defender away from the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.469
 moto 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.269
 I've already taken a lot of eighth and 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.939
 luiz felipe santana 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.389
 Dede to thiago silva he is simply 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:36.109
 very strong and although he did not 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:39.200
 as he says in the letter he is very tall 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.540
 added to its great strength to 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.790
 until it 's very good and it's 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.260
 better than I expected man and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.419
 his speed which I think is a 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.510
 a factor that many people should consider 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.909
 he is not of the fastest logic 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.129
 can not even fuck with the 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.199
 heliton or the duck, right? 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.719
 only that his strength added to the 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.359
 and very good finalization of 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.250
 left leg making the ideal player 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.310
 for training with only one 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.209
 centered then if you go 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.579
 count you use in a training such as 441 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:19.729
 that I'm using in this video, he's 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:22.879
 yielding very well 4 5 1 1 3 4 2 1 east 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:25.819
 type of formations beauty the right leg 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.739
 the game is not there great things you do not 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.769
 will be able to make many goals with 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.159
 bad leg because he has only three 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.579
 iron stars and also his dribble 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.430
 is based on body play so have 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.009
 this in mind beauty he has control 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.150
 Very good ball too good 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.879
 né cara 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.250
 I thought it was going to be very thick on the ball. 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.219
 with five in the ball of good with him da 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.759
 oscot in a circle in the defenders and everything 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.040
 more 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.889
 he is simply very good and hold the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.159
 ball and make the position of pivot beauty the 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.530
 positioning is very good despite 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.780
 to go back a bit too much for the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.449
 defense my tastes do not know why he does 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.359
 But I always see him helping 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:14.299
 his pass is a show only that 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.039
 as I do not consider this attribute 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.760
 important for the isolated 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.370
 with him I'm going to give a beauty discontinuity 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.010
 good now it brings with 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.030
 final conclusions his orange letter 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.860
 definitely not good like the letter 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.190
 fifa 12 silver 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.729
 but for the low price of it and still for the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.130
 excellent finish halt strength and 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.050
 positioning I would recommend 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.419
 anyone who wants a style of play 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.820
 different or for those who want a 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.790
 centered on your team that does not 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.610
 be a sprinter like uelliton duck 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.100
 marked her is vagner love etc 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.100
 good guys this is the video of ours 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.620
 end of joer 7 worth 10 because i'm 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.500
 considering that it is not a 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.630
 for everyone and loses a 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.210
 little practice of patience for you 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.010
 to use it with beauty efficiency 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.139
 That's how you liked the video.
