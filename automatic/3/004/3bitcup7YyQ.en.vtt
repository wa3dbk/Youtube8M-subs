00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
you all how I was going to do my tree

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.280 
you all how I was going to do my tree
trunks<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.880> our<00:00:09.030> tree<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.019> did<00:00:10.260> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
trunks you see this is our tree we did a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.570 
trunks you see this is our tree we did a
few<00:00:10.440> minutes<00:00:10.559> ago<00:00:10.710> now<00:00:10.950> I've<00:00:11.070> left<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> wire

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
few minutes ago now I've left the wire

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.629 
few minutes ago now I've left the wire
really<00:00:11.880> long<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:14.460> wire

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
really long but you can see the wire

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.390 
really long but you can see the wire
goes<00:00:14.849> right<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> base<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
goes right up to the to the base of the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.080 
goes right up to the to the base of the
tree<00:00:17.400> limbs<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:18.289> our<00:00:19.550> tree<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.730> finished

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
tree limbs or our tree we finished

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
tree limbs or our tree we finished
anyway<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
anyway what we're going to do or what I

anyway what we're going to do or what I
did<00:00:23.400> yes<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:24.990> ways<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.560> but

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
did yes there's some ways to do this but

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.970 
did yes there's some ways to do this but
the<00:00:27.090> things<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> need<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.859> need

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the things you need to do it is you need

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.460 
the things you need to do it is you need
a<00:00:29.039> couple<00:00:29.220> pair<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> hemostats<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.300> grab<00:00:30.510> hold

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
a couple pair of hemostats to grab hold

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.270 
a couple pair of hemostats to grab hold
your<00:00:31.740> tree<00:00:32.180> you<00:00:33.180> need<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:34.020> masking<00:00:34.890> tape<00:00:34.920> if

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
your tree you need some masking tape if

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.950 
your tree you need some masking tape if
you<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.670> some<00:00:35.850> half-inch<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.870> be

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you can get some half-inch it would be

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
you can get some half-inch it would be
better<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> three-quarters<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.040> harder

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
better to three-quarters a little harder

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
better to three-quarters a little harder
to<00:00:38.309> work<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.540> right

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to work with but that's all I have right

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
to work with but that's all I have right
now<00:00:39.829> I<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.579> lightweight<00:00:42.260> bondo<00:00:43.610> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
now I have some lightweight bondo you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.190 
now I have some lightweight bondo you
get<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
get that this is this is not the can to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.600 
get that this is this is not the can to
come<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
come in and I put it in here to make it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
come in and I put it in here to make it
stay<00:00:47.969> keep<00:00:48.420> longer<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
stay keep longer you get it in the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
stay keep longer you get it in the
automotive<00:00:50.250> store<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.670> use<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
automotive store but I use the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
automotive store but I use the
lightweight<00:00:51.329> body<00:00:52.199> filler<00:00:52.559> small<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.070> why

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
lightweight body filler small that's why

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.319 
lightweight body filler small that's why
this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.730> parts

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this is two parts

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
this is two parts
you<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.559> part<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.190> then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you put one part of this and then

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
you put one part of this and then
squeeze<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> hardener

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
squeeze out a little bit of the hardener

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.369 
squeeze out a little bit of the hardener
for<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
for it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
for it
anyway<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.710> exacto

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
anyway and then you also need an exacto

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.810 
anyway and then you also need an exacto
knife<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.180> couple<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:04.280> popsicle<00:01:05.280> popsicle

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
knife and a couple of popsicle popsicle

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.500 
knife and a couple of popsicle popsicle
sticks<00:01:06.150> anyway<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.890> quick

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
sticks anyway to do this really quick

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.670 
sticks anyway to do this really quick
you<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.049> your<00:01:10.080> work<00:01:10.380> under<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you got it you got your work under a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.899 
you got it you got your work under a
time<00:01:10.920> frame<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.400> once<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.760> add<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
time frame because once you add the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
time frame because once you add the
hardener<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.990> works<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.500> goes<00:01:13.680> pretty

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
hardener to this it works it goes pretty

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
hardener to this it works it goes pretty
quick<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> add<00:01:15.420> too<00:01:15.600> much

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
quick and you don't want to add too much

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200 
quick and you don't want to add too much
harder<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.680> it'll<00:01:16.950> kick<00:01:17.549> off<00:01:17.729> too<00:01:17.970> fast

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
harder because it'll kick off too fast

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
harder because it'll kick off too fast
and<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and when I just get out a little bit of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.660 
and when I just get out a little bit of
bondo<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.710> already<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> tree<00:01:23.369> here

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
bondo and I already have a tree here

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
bondo and I already have a tree here
that<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.170> earlier

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that I know this is one of my earlier

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.510 
that I know this is one of my earlier
ones<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> doesn't<00:01:25.770> look<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.040> good<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
ones it doesn't look as good but I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
ones it doesn't look as good but I
figure<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> trunk<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
figure we do the trunk on it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
figure we do the trunk on it
but<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.439> need<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.619> figure<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.130> big<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
but you need to figure out how big you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.840 
but you need to figure out how big you
want<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:29.939> trunk<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.860> wrap<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.640> start

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
want your trunk I wrap it I just start

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.300 
want your trunk I wrap it I just start
wrapping<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.869> masking<00:01:34.590> tape<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
wrapping it in the masking tape and just

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.590 
wrapping it in the masking tape and just
we're<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.729> making<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> bulk

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we're just making a little bit of bulk

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
we're just making a little bit of bulk
here<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> add<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.979> much

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
here so we don't have to add as much

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.390 
here so we don't have to add as much
bondo<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.210> anyway<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> tree<00:01:41.189> we're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
bondo to it anyway I take the tree we're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.510 
bondo to it anyway I take the tree we're
gonna<00:01:41.490> lay<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.700> off<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> side<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
gonna lay it off here to the side and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
gonna lay it off here to the side and
we're<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.610> mix<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.939> our<00:01:45.060> bondo<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> all

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
we're gonna mix up our bondo and all

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
we're gonna mix up our bondo and all
undoes<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.119> takes<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.470> barely

better<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:13.470> we'll<00:04:13.590> get<00:04:13.650> those<00:04:13.800> out<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
better but we'll get those out of the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.070 
better but we'll get those out of the
way<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.880> what<00:04:15.210> it<00:04:15.450> wasn't<00:04:15.810> start<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.109> harden

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
way but what it wasn't start to harden

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.300 
way but what it wasn't start to harden
we're<00:04:19.080> just<00:04:19.200> going<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.410> keep<00:04:19.650> pulling<00:04:19.950> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
we're just going to keep pulling and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.690 
we're just going to keep pulling and
this<00:04:20.519> makes<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.850> look<00:04:20.910> like<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.390> bark<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
this makes it look like the bark and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.740 
this makes it look like the bark and
it'll<00:04:23.700> pull<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.120> down<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.450> where<00:04:24.570> it's<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it'll pull it down to where it's a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:36.440 
it'll pull it down to where it's a
little<00:04:24.840> fatter<00:04:25.170> at<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.500> bot

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.720 

and<00:04:36.990> as<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.290> goes<00:04:37.470> you'll<00:04:38.130> see<00:04:38.370> some<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.670> the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
and as it goes you'll see some of the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.240 
and as it goes you'll see some of the
bondo<00:04:39.180> start<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.750> roll<00:04:40.020> up<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.620> that's<00:04:40.890> okay

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
bondo start to roll up and that's okay

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.210 
bondo start to roll up and that's okay
because<00:04:41.340> that'll<00:04:41.640> look<00:04:41.730> like<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.860> bark<00:04:43.860> is

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
because that'll look like the bark is

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.120 
because that'll look like the bark is
shedding<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.880> little<00:04:45.090> bit<00:04:45.800> we'll<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.070> all

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
shedding a little bit we'll do that all

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:57.370 
shedding a little bit we'll do that all
the<00:04:47.490> way<00:04:47.610> around

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.200 

now<00:04:57.920> you<00:04:58.280> just<00:04:58.310> have<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.610> play<00:04:58.820> with<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.060> to

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
now you just have to play with this to

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.520 
now you just have to play with this to
you<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.630> my<00:04:59.990> second<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:02.350> still<00:05:03.350> got

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
you this is my second one so I still got

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.860 
you this is my second one so I still got
to<00:05:03.650> get<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:05.090> good<00:05:05.240> thing<00:05:05.360> about<00:05:05.420> this<00:05:05.690> if

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
to get and a good thing about this if

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.570 
to get and a good thing about this if
you<00:05:05.960> don't<00:05:05.990> like<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.560> with<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.160> tape<00:05:07.370> on

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
you don't like it with that tape on

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.190 
you don't like it with that tape on
there<00:05:07.760> if<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.150> grab<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.390> hold<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:08.870> right<00:05:09.050> you

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
there if you grab a hold of it right you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200 
there if you grab a hold of it right you
can<00:05:09.260> probably<00:05:09.530> probably<00:05:10.160> remove<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.060> whole

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
can probably probably remove the whole

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.570 
can probably probably remove the whole
thing<00:05:11.240> pretty<00:05:11.750> easily<00:05:11.980> once<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.190> gets<00:05:13.340> hard

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
thing pretty easily once it gets hard

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.420 
thing pretty easily once it gets hard
but<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:16.850> can<00:05:17.000> see<00:05:17.860> or<00:05:18.860> hopefully<00:05:19.190> see<00:05:19.400> I

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
but so you can see or hopefully see I

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.460 
but so you can see or hopefully see I
got<00:05:19.760> a<00:05:19.790> little<00:05:20.000> bit<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.390> bondage<00:05:21.170> rolled

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
got a little bit of the bondage rolled

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.950 
got a little bit of the bondage rolled
up<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.520> looks<00:05:22.700> like<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:23.030> bark<00:05:23.330> is

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
up and it looks like the bark is

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.220 
up and it looks like the bark is
shedding<00:05:25.030> now<00:05:26.030> we<00:05:26.090> will<00:05:26.510> end<00:05:26.840> up<00:05:26.930> having<00:05:27.200> to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
shedding now we will end up having to

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.320 
shedding now we will end up having to
clean<00:05:27.470> off<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.650> bottom<00:05:28.100> down<00:05:28.250> here<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:28.790> but

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
clean off the bottom down here and but

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.270 
clean off the bottom down here and but
we<00:05:29.420> can<00:05:29.600> do<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.990> later<00:05:30.050> once<00:05:30.710> this<00:05:30.890> is<00:05:31.040> nice

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
we can do that later once this is nice

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.070 
we can do that later once this is nice
and<00:05:31.550> hard<00:05:31.790> okay<00:05:32.420> I'm<00:05:32.540> gonna<00:05:32.660> leave<00:05:32.780> this<00:05:32.930> one

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
and hard okay I'm gonna leave this one

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.200 
and hard okay I'm gonna leave this one
off<00:05:33.170> to<00:05:33.320> sit<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.830> a<00:05:34.010> good<00:05:34.190> thing<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.550> with<00:05:35.060> you

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
off to sit and a good thing is with you

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.830 
off to sit and a good thing is with you
use<00:05:35.510> hemostats<00:05:36.080> you<00:05:36.260> can<00:05:36.410> now<00:05:36.590> hang<00:05:37.040> this<00:05:37.310> up

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
use hemostats you can now hang this up

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.030 
use hemostats you can now hang this up
and<00:05:38.840> what<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:38.990> did<00:05:39.170> is<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.350> grabbed<00:05:39.620> in<00:05:39.800> here

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
and what I did is I grabbed in here

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.200 
and what I did is I grabbed in here
where<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.550> really<00:05:40.850> wouldn't<00:05:41.030> make<00:05:41.180> a

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
where it really wouldn't make a

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.910 
where it really wouldn't make a
difference<00:05:41.390> if<00:05:41.690> I<00:05:41.810> if<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.260> grabbed<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.560> wholesome

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
difference if I if I grabbed a wholesome

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.350 
difference if I if I grabbed a wholesome
so<00:05:43.400> I'm<00:05:43.490> gonna<00:05:43.580> set<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.790> one<00:05:44.030> off<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.270> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
so I'm gonna set that one off to the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540 
so I'm gonna set that one off to the
side<00:05:44.570> and<00:05:44.870> let<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.410> heart<00:05:45.620> finish<00:05:45.920> hardening<00:05:46.370> I

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
side and let it heart finish hardening I

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.850 
side and let it heart finish hardening I
had<00:05:47.510> one<00:05:47.720> this<00:05:47.960> is<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.170> very<00:05:48.350> first<00:05:48.590> one<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:48.830> did

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
had one this is the very first one I did

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.910 
had one this is the very first one I did
I<00:05:49.280> hope<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:49.790> can<00:05:49.940> see<00:05:50.180> it<00:05:50.330> anyway<00:05:51.140> you<00:05:51.470> can<00:05:51.620> see

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
I hope you can see it anyway you can see

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.250 
I hope you can see it anyway you can see
how<00:05:52.220> rough<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:55.820> tree<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.600> trunk<00:05:56.840> looks

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
how rough the the tree the trunk looks

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.230 
how rough the the tree the trunk looks
it<00:05:57.830> looks<00:05:58.010> like<00:05:58.130> that<00:05:58.310> all<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.460> ran<00:05:58.730> in<00:05:58.880> it<00:05:59.000> it's

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
it looks like that all I ran in it it's

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.300 
it looks like that all I ran in it it's
just<00:05:59.390> unique<00:05:59.570> to<00:06:00.080> everyone<00:06:00.500> because<00:06:00.680> you're

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
just unique to everyone because you're

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.890 
just unique to everyone because you're
just<00:06:01.460> taking<00:06:01.580> that<00:06:01.910> exacto<00:06:02.480> knife<00:06:02.690> and

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
just taking that exacto knife and

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.890 
just taking that exacto knife and
pulling<00:06:03.440> down<00:06:03.820> just<00:06:04.820> keep<00:06:04.970> pulling<00:06:05.390> down<00:06:05.570> and

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
pulling down just keep pulling down and

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.960 
pulling down just keep pulling down and
it<00:06:06.260> just<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.680> just<00:06:06.710> breaks<00:06:07.520> it<00:06:07.640> up<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:07.940> looks

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
it just it just breaks it up it looks

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.660 
it just it just breaks it up it looks
like<00:06:08.390> a<00:06:08.720> bark<00:06:09.260> of<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.440> tree<00:06:09.470> now<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.220> said<00:06:10.460> we<00:06:10.490> can

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
like a bark of a tree now I said we can

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.890 
like a bark of a tree now I said we can
come<00:06:10.790> in<00:06:10.910> here<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.120> we<00:06:11.270> can<00:06:11.390> cut<00:06:11.630> this<00:06:11.750> off

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
come in here and we can cut this off

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.750
