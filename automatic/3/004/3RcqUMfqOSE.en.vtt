00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.510
 and then channel people do it yourself 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.640
 We're dying for 2015 and we're going 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.410
 installing a loudspeaker on the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.560
 then to install the speaker of 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.849
 door you have to mount door 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.829
 one of that door 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:37.840
 we have a screw here screw 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.710
 here and three more screws here in the part 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.989
 from below 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.690
 here is how we will remove these 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.860
 three screws and then the door it has 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 a glue 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.890
 in this part here and we have to take 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
 Careful because it's a glue is slow 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.060
 too much 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.820
 otherwise you will get your car dirty and 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:05.070
 also mess people here on the knob 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.070
 We're going to remove the screw, I closed it. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.360
 and now you will find a way to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.170
 out 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.039
 here she has wire that she opens it's just 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.899
 Turn her up as soon as she goes. 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:25.270
 let go of the wire stayed here before 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.009
 we remove the lining of the dead people 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.249
 have to take it out here 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.439
 the finish on the rearview mirror 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:36.690
 we come with the low spatula that 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:42.120
 pick up here and down here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:46.040
 that he will loosen a lock here 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:51.510
 another hangs here and just pulls with the mother 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 Hi, what is he going to leave? 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.210
 so let's here the disadvantage to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.200
 disassembly itself 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.280
 It has a lock up here and a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 another hangs at the car end here and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 people have to take care of that because 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.100
 this area here ok has a ring then the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.310
 People are here or care to drop the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.310
 ball 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.890
 we returned the ball in the bottom that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.330
 There is a lock here that says it does not end 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.330
 We passed and now it's easier. 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:03:00.709
 maninho and another one here I think joÃ£o a 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:04.459
 little ball and now just pull the fire 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.959
 which forms Brazil and denoted it as 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.840
 doors we can see here 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:18.950
 in the glue I told you I fired 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.350
 round the whole door so here it is already 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.570
 dismantled the door liner 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:30.019
 here we have the handle rod a lock 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.350
 that takes a lock here and the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.940
 I did not mention to you that she is 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.200
 very very sticky table 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.690
 so you have to be careful with that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.790
 glue that you do not get soiled and not 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.269
 dirty the car, that's it 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.170
 If you liked this video like this from here 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.459
 low jewelry I read ke puts on your 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.730
 facebook and shows for their friends and 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.580
 assembly is the reverse order of this 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.590
 disassembly 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.590
 and until the next video
