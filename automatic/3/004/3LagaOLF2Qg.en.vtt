00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.369
 open our press conference today 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.720
 to play hbw balingen weilstetten tsv 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.920
 hannover-burgdorf was founded 28 27 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.550
 half past 15 to the press conference 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.800
 I greet the coach of the guests 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.400
 christoph hobmaier and managing director 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.950
 benjamin chateau our trainer markus 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.390
 Gaugisch the side is now with us 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.130
 continue unbeaten hearty 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.910
 Congratulations on the victory and ours 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.660
 executive Director 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.180
 you can certainly neither the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.920
 first half, still the second half 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.899
 not a game for weak nerves 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.360
 I think theirs have suffered as well 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.420
 like ours but their conclusion to the game yes 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.369
 first of all congratulations to markus and 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.920
 Bernd and the team to win I believe 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.590
 we wanted to see something exciting 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.189
 for all audiences certainly that it 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.270
 what do you expect from handball? 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.450
 From my point of view, we have in the first 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.700
 also a reasonable game 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.619
 have certainly made mistakes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.649
 come in at number we have 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.689
 so that's pretty good come in the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.929
 second half we have attacked 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.840
 Unfortunately, our speed is no longer 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.369
 can show that is natural 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.799
 also because it already is for us 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.899
 the fifth game is and for the hbw it is 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.370
 the third and yes at the end we fight 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.730
 get back to us 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.410
 but lose in the end I have just button 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.400
 May my team like mine 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.990
 make team not accusingly 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.450
 today was a decent game the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.430
 We have shown and think in the end the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.130
 course evaluation of course decide 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.490
 and then we got a few percent 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.990
 missing 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.410
 and that's why we're going loser now 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.780
 from the field 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.980
 thank you very much for your conclusion 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.870
 markus then I can also take you around yours 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 ask conclusion 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.250
 for me was actually to the middle of the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.770
 second half martin 7 or better 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.520
 goals but I think brennan was cat 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 our strong backing 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.170
 Thanks for the congratulations 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.780
 We were out the back of the happy 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.270
 winner if you are so close the game 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 I 'll be happy to win 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.460
 today this many end for us 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.050
 had that we will move all the way 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.850
 the whole strokes we just got in 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.500
 It had been an up and down game 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.739
 There are also plenty of opportunities to warm up 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.570
 let and also have some light ones 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.920
 get gates and still has the 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.209
 team continued to believe in themselves and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 is then sometime in the second 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.160
 halftime only in this in this tunnel 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.350
 Come where you have seen that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.670
 the players believe in themselves 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.560
 unfortunately this was only too early at the first half 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.060
 start like that and then it has a bit 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.060
 a bit eased 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.070
 Therefore, after 17 o'clock is too much in a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.110
 half time and in the second half was 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.910
 the interaction with with coverage and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.620
 cat of course very very good we have 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.670
 only ten gates get in the second 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.250
 Half-time cat has us down more often 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.989
 famous behind he rescued and equipment 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.080
 has made a good game very clear 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.760
 but it is easier for him too 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.340
 the defense makes an impression and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.989
 not just watching how the opponent the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.209
 Balls playing back and forth from living with 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.519
 321 that you pressurize your opponent 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.780
 sets and then, of course, the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.330
 goalkeepers can be easier 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920
 show but it was again like the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.400
 last home win if you have it 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.130
 look 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 Everyone has done their part each 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.970
 has torn for the team 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.530
 and above all, has remained positive and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.570
 I'm glad that we have one 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.090
 We have development even if we just 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.100
 only two more small building blocks in 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.000
 this is our way but we are 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.970
 can only do what we do 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.359
 influence and from which we go 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.910
 happy home of course markus 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.090
 for the sake of your conclusion so far the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.470
 Both coaches for today's game there 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.480
 it ask from the press if that 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.110
 not so then I may also the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.970
 Both managing directors to their conclusion to the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.490
 offer play from their point of view as 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.610
 Managing Director he benjamin first 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.910
 Of course congratulations to all the hw 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.220
 I am happy to be here 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.810
 rightly important building block on the way 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.770
 To maintain class has seen today 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.110
 the hell south of the name not in vain 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.130
 wearing 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.100
 failed in the second half 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.590
 to keep cool as we ourselves 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.350
 that maybe had hoped 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.900
 look at the statistics 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.210
 probably first the short-term 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.800
 as a short-term conclusion that the 50th 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.389
 series from 16 19 to 21 19 one 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.120
 but weaker phase of us was 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.480
 nonetheless I think that has 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.480
 team 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.810
 regardless of the increased error 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.880
 pay the second half and agile 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.260
 was delivered 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.520
 that is what balingen definitely 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.320
 magic on the plate and that pleases 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.090
 me that we have accepted so 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.150
 See the end with a gate here 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.490
 b lose that can also be different 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.450
 go out there are the last minutes 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.890
 I think I have to go over it again 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.960
 think about what happened there 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.930
 run time penalties 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.730
 that is very nice for the audience 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.420
 for us but unfortunately not in the 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.450
 thank you very much if you are with many 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.860
 Thanks and then I can take care of you 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.620
 offer a statement to the game 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.270
 but you were there in emsdetten like 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.950
 day night or it was already like day and 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.170
 night but that's just how out of town 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.600
 and home benjamin rightly says since the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.890
 envelope looks cooked today and the 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.830
 Of course, this also brings our players to the game 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.390
 absolute top performance each one 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.610
 Game is incomprehensible here 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.100
 we always always have 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.930
 Endgames and the costs annoy without 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.970
 the end of that yes we are the happy one 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.380
 winner that is the only important and whether 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.000
 happy or unhappy are two 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.430
 points on the side and only that 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240
 is crucial 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.280
 I think there you can build on it 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.390
 As Markus always rightly says step 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.330
 step by step forward 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.380
 if we continue like this then you will 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.070
 with safety our harvest 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.870
 retract 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.330
 I wish the Hanoverians all the best 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.340
 drive home and would be happy 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.620
 if you win as many games as possible 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.120
 That can only help us and I hope 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.070
 see you next season again 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.630
 the cave is super great many thanks 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.820
 as far as the four responsible for 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.420
 Today's game there are questions from sides 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.520
 The press does not seem to be that way 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.750
 then I have three results and 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.150
 it shows the importance that the 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.260
 Today's victory was Minden wins against 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:06.230
 Berlin with 30 28 flensburg wins against 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.930
 lübbecke with 31 20 and gummersbach 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.490
 loses at home against hsv handball 25 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:16.250
 31 donate today's press conference 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.590
 wish hannover good home much 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.960
 success above all things also European 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.840
 you deserve after the last one 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.220
 Year was outstanding and I think her 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.360
 also comes in this 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.360
 still thank you
