00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 we started off on the wrong foot 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 we never approached the game on 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 mister had said we weren't 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.350
 we were focused on 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.269
 heating and nothing you need these 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.909
 start here you have to face them 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.449
 in the best way if not then go under 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.909
 after 50 seconds 10 then you find yourself 30 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.140
 normal first time end if it is not the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.920
 right concentration 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.810
 they end up so sure bubble but I have 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.179
 I saw that there was no 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 offside however the referee saw it like this 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.770
 so we can't do anything about it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.289
 certainly it's nice to score goals though 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.399
 I would have been happier to take home 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.319
 the three points the normal ones of goals 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.420
 they are of little use if the team does not 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.959
 wins because in the end I do n't want to 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 no part but nothing 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.690
 goals are 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.810
 are those to live the day like 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.510
 I've always said they don't change at least for 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.580
 this year it is so and we hope to do the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.620
 best possible at the team level e 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.960
 because then if you do a good level of 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
 team of salt was more symbol ha 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.280
 marked a little in all the ways we say of 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.630
 head as it had never happened then between 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.900
 quotes is the first time nothing 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.400
 we hope we hope to continue like this 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.880
 we hope to do well as in the group of 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.890
 going 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.670
 the points are the same 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.319
 nothing with a few goals conceded less and 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.180
 nothing we go on like this and move on 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 that we will take away so many 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.420
 satisfactions 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.189
 and passed the round and we did well 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.829
 so it is necessary to continue this way again 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.409
 the defeat now behind us start again 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.209
 from brescia and try to win here in 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.810
 house that our audience will be there a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.810
 support 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.010
 yes absolutely thank you all 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.470
 I say hopefully we hope to go a little 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.799
 better even if we know if we have 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.689
 played well yesterday but went a little way 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.819
 we started off a little bad anyway 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.030
 I thank all the croton fans for 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.030
 greetings
