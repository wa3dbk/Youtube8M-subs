00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
fast enough to get to the start and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.819 
fast enough to get to the start and
attack<00:01:57.880> or<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.090> number<00:01:58.209> one<00:01:58.539> detangle<00:01:59.169> but<00:01:59.709> in

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
this in the regular game over for some

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.749 
this in the regular game over for some
reason<00:02:02.139> they<00:02:02.229> always<00:02:02.619> allow<00:02:03.099> and<00:02:03.459> chip

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
reason they always allow and chip

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.969 
reason they always allow and chip
somehow<00:02:04.239> so<00:02:04.539> they<00:02:05.200> didn't<00:02:05.439> allow<00:02:05.649> with<00:02:05.859> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
somehow so they didn't allow with the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.230 
somehow so they didn't allow with the
left<00:02:06.189> tackle

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
left tackle

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.540 
left tackle
starting<00:02:08.170> right<00:02:08.319> guard<00:02:08.380> actually<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.459> my

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
starting right guard actually one of my

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.780 
starting right guard actually one of my
friends<00:02:09.940> during<00:02:10.090> evan<00:02:10.599> is<00:02:11.290> he<00:02:12.130> actually<00:02:12.280> steps

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
friends during evan is he actually steps

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.270 
friends during evan is he actually steps
back<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.420> he<00:02:13.959> plays<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.500> correctly<00:02:15.069> because

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
back and he plays this correctly because

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.360 
back and he plays this correctly because
it<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.000> football<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.260> focus<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:17.890> inside

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
it really football you focus on inside

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.699 
it really football you focus on inside
pressure<00:02:18.670> I'm<00:02:19.420> warning<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> focus<00:02:20.260> outside

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
pressure I'm warning you focus outside

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.309 
pressure I'm warning you focus outside
pressure<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.630> actually<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.020> very

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
pressure so this is actually a very

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.309 
pressure so this is actually a very
legit<00:02:23.890> scheme<00:02:24.670> based<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.450> how<00:02:25.599> this<00:02:25.780> offensive

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
legit scheme based on how this offensive

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.890 
legit scheme based on how this offensive
line<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.680> playing<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.910> he<00:02:28.090> steps<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.720> again

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
line is playing so he steps out again

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
line is playing so he steps out again
sees<00:02:29.349> pressure<00:02:29.620> coming<00:02:29.920> inside<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.459> gives<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
sees pressure coming inside it gives a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.809 
sees pressure coming inside it gives a
little<00:02:30.910> shove<00:02:31.349> but<00:02:32.349> again<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.769> have<00:02:33.010> great

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
little shove but again we have great

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.490 
little shove but again we have great
pressure<00:02:34.180> coming<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.959> we're<00:02:35.080> able<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.380> get

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
your defense unique to itself instead of

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.120 
your defense unique to itself instead of
