00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
initially thought that ranking up in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.140 
initially thought that ranking up in
this<00:00:25.980> game<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:26.939> out

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
kills as many captures as possible now

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
kills as many captures as possible now
as<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> degree<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:33.210> it's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
as that is a degree of it it's not it's

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
as that is a degree of it it's not it's
not<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.900> main<00:00:34.140> thing<00:00:34.170> there's<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.250> thing

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
at the beginning this game and I've

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.190 
at the beginning this game and I've
literally<00:00:59.580> just<00:00:59.670> turned<00:01:00.270> level<00:01:00.540> 36<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.050> well

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
literally just turned level 36 as well

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.960 
literally just turned level 36 as well
by<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.560> guys<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.580> not<00:01:02.700> like<00:01:02.820> I've<00:01:02.940> been

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
by the way guys it's not like I've been

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.050 
by the way guys it's not like I've been
it<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.300> ages<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.720> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.080> 3<00:01:04.880> challenges<00:01:05.880> at

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it for ages so I have 3 challenges at

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.160 
it for ages so I have 3 challenges at
the<00:01:06.150> start<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.050> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the start of this game that I have to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
the start of this game that I have to
complete<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> kill

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
complete one is kill

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
complete one is kill
I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.940> another<00:01:09.600> peashooter<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.440> one<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I think another peashooter and one is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
I think another peashooter and one is
kill<00:01:11.460> someone<00:01:11.820> else<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> sticky<00:01:12.630> explodey

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
kill someone else with a sticky explodey

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
kill someone else with a sticky explodey
grenade'<00:01:13.620> thingy<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.790> hopefully<00:01:15.120> we<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> get

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
grenade' thingy so hopefully we can get

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.610 
grenade' thingy so hopefully we can get
both<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.750> done<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> game<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> we'll

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
both of these done this game and we'll

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.650 
both of these done this game and we'll
see<00:01:16.800> if<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> levels<00:01:17.520> us<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
see if it levels us up so really it

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.330 
see if it levels us up so really it
shouldn't<00:01:18.840> levels<00:01:19.200> us<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.950> doing<00:01:20.040> three

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
shouldn't levels us up just doing three

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
shouldn't levels us up just doing three
challenges<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.680> did

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
challenges in one game because I did

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.430 
challenges in one game because I did
rank<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.280> last<00:01:23.490> game<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.850> we'll<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.180> how

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
rank up last game but we'll see how

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.280 
rank up last game but we'll see how
quickly<00:01:25.440> if<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.100> rank<00:01:26.370> us<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.140> want

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
quickly if it does rank us up so we want

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
quickly if it does rank us up so we want
to<00:01:28.380> check<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.620> out<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.010> yeah<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.580> what<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to check these out so yeah one of what I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.290 
to check these out so yeah one of what I
thought<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.360> maybe<00:01:30.540> Jesus<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.970> got<00:01:33.120> loads

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
thought was maybe Jesus if you got loads

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.430 
thought was maybe Jesus if you got loads
of<00:01:33.390> kills<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> did<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.260> well<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
of kills and you did really well in

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.050 
of kills and you did really well in
garden<00:01:34.830> ops<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.070> level<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.730> quick<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
garden ops you level up really quick but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360 
garden ops you level up really quick but
I<00:01:36.120> found<00:01:36.420> myself<00:01:36.570> once<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.409> hit<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.710> level<00:01:38.100> 30

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
I found myself once I hit about level 30

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.430 
I found myself once I hit about level 30
I<00:01:38.550> just<00:01:38.940> did<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.120> rank<00:01:39.480> up<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> was

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
I just did not rank up at all and I was

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440 
I just did not rank up at all and I was
really<00:01:40.620> confused<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:42.030> went<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> did

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
really confused then I went and did

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.200 
really confused then I went and did
challenges<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> level<00:01:43.950> 1<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.370> I<00:01:44.430> had<00:01:44.610> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
challenges for a level 1 that I had just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.570 
challenges for a level 1 that I had just
just<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.900> them<00:01:46.050> all<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> substantial

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
just to get them all up to a substantial

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.000 
just to get them all up to a substantial
level<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.090> after<00:01:49.050> I<00:01:49.110> did<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.590> ranked

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
level and after I did that I just ranked

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.040 
level and after I did that I just ranked
up<00:01:50.070> straightaway<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.540> reason<00:01:51.900> that

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
up straightaway and for some reason that

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.260 
up straightaway and for some reason that
is<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.400> rank<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.880> system<00:01:54.180> in

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
is what is like the rank up system in

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
is what is like the rank up system in
this<00:01:54.360> game<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.110> love<00:01:55.380> challenges<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this game is if they love challenges so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.680 
this game is if they love challenges so

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
there we go so we got the kill there so

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.790 
there we go so we got the kill there so
that<00:02:08.159> is<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.489> those<00:02:08.700> completed<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.810> our<00:02:10.050> guys

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that is all those completed and our guys

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.949 
that is all those completed and our guys
going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.130> level<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.730> level<00:02:12.180> 5<00:02:12.420> let's<00:02:12.840> see

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
going to level up to level 5 let's see

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.210 
going to level up to level 5 let's see
if<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.140> level<00:02:13.350> up<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.530> well<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.890> leveled<00:02:14.160> up

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
if we level up as well and we leveled up

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.200 
if we level up as well and we leveled up
as<00:02:14.340> well<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.700> they

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
as well so they

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.730 
as well so they
three<00:02:15.540> challenges<00:02:15.930> got<00:02:16.110> me<00:02:16.230> leveled<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.710> I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
three challenges got me leveled up so I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.250 
three challenges got me leveled up so I
think<00:02:16.830> doing<00:02:17.820> these<00:02:18.030> challenges<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.930> real

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
think doing these challenges is the real

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.040 
think doing these challenges is the real
best<00:02:20.130> way<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> level<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.060> even<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.930> know

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
best way to level up so even you know

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.020 
best way to level up so even you know
once<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.920> character<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
once you get with one character to the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.460 
once you get with one character to the
level<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.270> want<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.690> got<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> pshew<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
level you want so I got the pshew to the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.290 
level you want so I got the pshew to the
level<00:02:25.710> 10<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.040> example<00:02:26.490> but<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> rest

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
level 10 for example but then the rest

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720 
level 10 for example but then the rest
of<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.660> wanted<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.230> now<00:02:28.500> level<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:28.980> my<00:02:29.010> actual

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
of it I wanted to now level up my actual

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.310 
of it I wanted to now level up my actual
like<00:02:30.240> me<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.320> everybody<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.970> level<00:02:33.930> 50

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
like me as in everybody to level 50

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.080 
like me as in everybody to level 50
which<00:02:34.500> was<00:02:34.740> said<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> top<00:02:35.640> level<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
which was said to be the top level but I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.660 
which was said to be the top level but I
believe<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.630> level<00:02:36.870> 80<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.430> more

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
believe it is level 80 now and more

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
believe it is level 80 now and more
levels<00:02:38.850> are<00:02:39.180> coming<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.630> well<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.650> do

the commentary now for the rest of the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.060 
the commentary now for the rest of the
game<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.930> are<00:02:48.960> just<00:02:49.380> playing<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.710> random<00:02:49.950> team

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
game we are just playing a random team

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.230 
game we are just playing a random team
deathmatch<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.760> doesn't<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.000> matter

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
deathmatch so it doesn't really matter

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640 
deathmatch so it doesn't really matter
and<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:51.900> actually<00:02:52.020> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> change<00:02:52.530> my

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
and I'm actually going to change my

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.460 
and I'm actually going to change my
class<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> hopefully<00:02:53.490> change<00:02:53.760> teams<00:02:54.090> if

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
class and hopefully change teams if

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.840 
class and hopefully change teams if
possible<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.740> go<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> another<00:02:56.340> character<00:02:56.820> I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
possible to go on to another character I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.220 
possible to go on to another character I
have<00:02:57.120> yes<00:02:58.020> we<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.100> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
have yes we can so I think I have the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.540 
have yes we can so I think I have the
here<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.320> go<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.860> Trumper<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.430> have

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
here we go so we have the Trumper I have

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.460 
here we go so we have the Trumper I have
to<00:03:02.640> destroy<00:03:02.970> some<00:03:03.270> shields<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> moment

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
to destroy some shields so the moment

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.750 
to destroy some shields so the moment
I'm<00:03:04.560> running<00:03:04.830> through<00:03:05.010> challenges<00:03:05.490> because<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
I'm running through challenges because I

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
I'm running through challenges because I
want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> level<00:03:06.360> up<00:03:06.480> level<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:07.440> also<00:03:07.770> does<00:03:07.980> give

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
want to level up level up also does give

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.620 
want to level up level up also does give
you<00:03:08.280> coins<00:03:08.460> as<00:03:08.730> well<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.540> good

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you coins as well so it's a really good

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.180 
you coins as well so it's a really good
way<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> kind<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.350> everything<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.890> want

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
way to kind of get everything you want

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.310 
way to kind of get everything you want
in<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.360> highly<00:03:12.630> recommend<00:03:12.990> doing<00:03:13.080> that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
in one so I highly recommend doing that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.170 
in one so I highly recommend doing that
so<00:03:13.500> let's<00:03:13.800> go<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.130> see<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.030> get

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
so let's go in and see if we can get

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660 
so let's go in and see if we can get
some<00:03:15.420> kills<00:03:15.980> no<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.070> didn't<00:03:17.220> even<00:03:17.340> need<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.550> get

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
some kills no we didn't even need to get

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.980 
some kills no we didn't even need to get
kills<00:03:17.880> with<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.240> need<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.480> find<00:03:18.750> some

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
kills with this we need to find some

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.470 
kills with this we need to find some
all-star<00:03:19.230> shields<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.490> ones<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.030> can

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
all-star shields now ones like this can

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.090 
all-star shields now ones like this can
be<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.810> pain<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.350> ass<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.740> think<00:03:22.770> I've<00:03:23.040> been

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
be a pain in the ass I think I've been

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.870 
be a pain in the ass I think I've been
too<00:03:23.190> stuck<00:03:23.400> on<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.750> or<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:25.140> ages<00:03:25.470> now

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
too stuck on this one or for ages now

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.180 
too stuck on this one or for ages now
now<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.910> initially<00:03:27.630> thought<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:29.040> went

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
now I initially thought that if I went

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.690 
now I initially thought that if I went
on<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.960> garden<00:03:30.960> ops<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.530> others<00:03:32.220> at<00:03:32.340> shield<00:03:32.520> is

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
on to garden ops the others at shield is

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.010 
on to garden ops the others at shield is
 that's<00:03:33.090> fine<00:03:33.270> I've<00:03:33.600> gone<00:03:33.780> underground

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
for it that's how much this shield means

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.960

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
to go on the ground which is a little

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.450 
to go on the ground which is a little
bit<00:04:54.810> quicker

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
bit quicker

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.260
