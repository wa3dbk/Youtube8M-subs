the<00:00:24.550> actual<00:00:24.880> beat<00:00:25.060> she's<00:00:25.210> been<00:00:25.359> fooling<00:00:25.539> with

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
the actual beat she's been fooling with

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.390 
the actual beat she's been fooling with
holidaymakers<00:00:26.380> but<00:00:26.560> as<00:00:26.679> you<00:00:26.769> can<00:00:26.859> see<00:00:26.920> with

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
we have to do now is just switch on the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660 
we have to do now is just switch on the
machine<00:00:34.239> if<00:00:35.199> you<00:00:35.290> look<00:00:35.440> around<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.250> back<00:00:36.400> here

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
machine if you look around the back here

machine if you look around the back here
switch<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.720> on<00:00:38.610> keep<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.729> search<00:00:39.879> head<00:00:40.120> from

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
switch it on keep the search head from

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.820 
switch it on keep the search head from
the<00:00:40.390> ground<00:00:40.629> just<00:00:41.080> obviously<00:00:41.440> that's<00:00:41.710> gonna

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
the ground just obviously that's gonna

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.920 
the ground just obviously that's gonna
affect<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.129> calibration<00:00:42.699> next<00:00:43.659> thing<00:00:43.809> you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
affect the calibration next thing you

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.759 
affect the calibration next thing you
should<00:00:43.960> see<00:00:44.110> you've<00:00:44.199> got<00:00:44.290> this<00:00:44.350> nice<00:00:44.500> big

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769

through<00:00:50.619> the<00:00:50.739> various<00:00:50.949> modes<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:53.260> eat<00:00:53.470> d13

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
through the various modes this eat d13

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.369 
through the various modes this eat d13
and<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.430> want<00:00:54.640> cod<00:00:54.940> conductive<00:00:55.540> brown<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.229> it's

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
and we want cod conductive brown so it's

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.840 
and we want cod conductive brown so it's
in<00:00:56.470> conductive<00:00:56.860> brand<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:57.369> we<00:00:57.460> have<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.729> do

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
in conductive brand so all we have to do

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.200 
in conductive brand so all we have to do
now<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.619> while<00:00:59.619> I'm<00:00:59.830> pumping<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.250> coil<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:01.119> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
now is while I'm pumping the coil to the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.619 
now is while I'm pumping the coil to the
ground<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.540> need<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.989> press<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.739> ground<00:01:02.979> button

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
ground I need to press the ground button

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.590 
ground I need to press the ground button
and<00:01:04.629> then<00:01:05.409> pump<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.040> coil<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.720> ground

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.210 

until<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.780> calibrates<00:01:12.350> itself

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.770 

there<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.850> go<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.210> makes<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.420> little<00:01:19.600> peep

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
there you go it makes a little peep

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.920 
there you go it makes a little peep
noise<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.740> then<00:01:21.010> it's<00:01:21.130> calibrated<00:01:21.780> I'll<00:01:22.780> just

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
noise and then it's calibrated I'll just

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.030 
noise and then it's calibrated I'll just
show<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.520> those<00:01:24.520> two<00:01:24.670> water<00:01:24.850> water

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.160 

there's<00:01:32.040> absolutely<00:01:32.640> no<00:01:32.970> forcing

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.410 

against<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> sweat<00:01:37.280> mineralized<00:01:37.759> sand<00:01:38.030> now

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
against the sweat mineralized sand now

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.090 
against the sweat mineralized sand now
what<00:01:38.689> we've<00:01:38.840> done<00:01:39.049> we've<00:01:39.380> just<00:01:39.650> before<00:01:39.920> this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
what we've done we've just before this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.770 
what we've done we've just before this
we've<00:01:40.220> just<00:01:40.400> dug<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.759> little<00:01:40.939> open<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.509> tides

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
we've just dug a little open the tides

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.740 
we've just dug a little open the tides
coming<00:01:42.020> up<00:01:42.200> we've<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:43.130> dug<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.520> little<00:01:43.759> Tesco

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
coming up we've just dug a little Tesco

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.690 
coming up we've just dug a little Tesco
which<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.380> approximately<00:01:46.270> 8<00:01:47.270> inches<00:01:47.479> deep

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
which is approximately 8 inches deep

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.230 
which is approximately 8 inches deep
nothing<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:49.939> just<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.270> check<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:52.240> there's

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
nothing here just to check that there's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.050 
nothing here just to check that there's
my<00:01:53.420> little<00:01:53.600> technical<00:01:54.409> stick<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.880> can

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
my little technical stick and you can

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.330 
my little technical stick and you can
see<00:01:56.240> 8<00:01:56.509> proximately<00:01:57.080> 8<00:01:57.289> inches

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.280 

they're<00:02:02.240> right<00:02:02.869> next<00:02:03.170> thing<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.979> do

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
they're right next thing to do

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.460 
they're right next thing to do
despite<00:02:06.070> my<00:02:06.360> usual<00:02:07.360> test<00:02:07.660> item<00:02:08.050> which<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.320> just

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
despite my usual test item which is just

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.610 
despite my usual test item which is just
the<00:02:08.560> 2,000<00:02:09.250> pound<00:02:10.000> coin<00:02:10.410> put<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the 2,000 pound coin put it in the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.970 
the 2,000 pound coin put it in the
bottom

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.440 

now<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.819> actual<00:02:17.970> sand<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
now you can see that the actual sand is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.780 
now you can see that the actual sand is
not<00:02:18.540> dripping<00:02:18.990> wet<00:02:19.170> other<00:02:19.440> thing<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
not dripping wet other thing is that you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.730 
not dripping wet other thing is that you
can<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.290> me<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
can see just to the right of me that the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.949 
can see just to the right of me that the
we've<00:02:25.740> tried<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.010> dig<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.340> hole<00:02:26.370> closer<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
we've tried to dig a hole closer to the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.660 
we've tried to dig a hole closer to the
sea<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.500> we're<00:02:28.830> getting<00:02:29.069> covered<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> waves

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
sea but we're getting covered in waves

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.949 
sea but we're getting covered in waves
and<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.819> really<00:02:33.060> doing<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.750> very<00:02:33.900> good

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
and it's not really doing a very good

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.520 
and it's not really doing a very good
job

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.230 

as<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.610> soon<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
as we can but as soon as we did the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.730 
as we can but as soon as we did the
whole<00:02:39.360> basically<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.140> built<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.470> straight

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
whole basically it built in straight

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.600 
whole basically it built in straight
away<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.190> got<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.459> come<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:43.370> that's<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
away so you got to come up so that's it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.490 
away so you got to come up so that's it
which<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.850> still<00:02:45.090> wet<00:02:45.690> Sam<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.350> not

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
which is still wet Sam but it's not

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.559 
which is still wet Sam but it's not
dripping<00:02:47.130> wet<00:02:47.400> sand<00:02:47.670> anyway<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.420> go

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
dripping wet sand anyway here we go

00:02:48.569 --> 00:03:00.820 
dripping wet sand anyway here we go
let's<00:02:49.110> show<00:02:49.260> we've<00:02:49.440> got

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.440 

I'm<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.400> sure<00:03:01.550> if<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.760> hear<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.180> think

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
I'm not sure if you hear and I think

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.210 
I'm not sure if you hear and I think
because<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.810> Chloe<00:03:03.050> but<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.440> my<00:03:03.710> cameraman

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
because it's Chloe but if my cameraman

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.470 
because it's Chloe but if my cameraman
comes<00:03:04.490> right<00:03:04.700> back<00:03:04.910> at<00:03:05.150> me

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
comes right back at me

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.250 
comes right back at me
near<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.320> speaker<00:03:07.870> you've<00:03:08.870> got<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.050> waves

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
near the speaker you've got the waves

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.450 
near the speaker you've got the waves
crashing<00:03:09.680> behind<00:03:09.920> us<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:12.740> get<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.920> nice<00:03:13.130> solid

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
crashing behind us you get a nice solid

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.260 
crashing behind us you get a nice solid
signal<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:16.250> ice<00:03:16.400> that's<00:03:16.880> buried<00:03:17.180> it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
signal and ice that's buried it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.740 
signal and ice that's buried it
approximately<00:03:18.850> 8<00:03:19.850> inches<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:21.250> that's<00:03:22.250> us

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
approximately 8 inches and that's us

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.450 
approximately 8 inches and that's us
really<00:03:23.750> sounding<00:03:24.140> off<00:03:24.260> well<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.800> yeah<00:03:25.280> really

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
really sounding off well so yeah really

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.580 
really sounding off well so yeah really
pleased<00:03:25.760> with<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:25.940> performance<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:27.320> you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
pleased with that performance and you

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.790 
pleased with that performance and you
can<00:03:27.710> see<00:03:27.920> let's<00:03:28.190> go<00:03:28.250> back<00:03:28.490> out<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> sea

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.700 

in<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.160> way

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.540 

no<00:03:35.710> forcing<00:03:36.220> whatsoever<00:03:36.310> oh<00:03:36.820> there<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.690> go

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
no forcing whatsoever oh there you go

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.250 
no forcing whatsoever oh there you go
hence<00:03:39.550> why<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:39.820> couldn't<00:03:40.180> dig<00:03:40.360> any<00:03:40.510> closer<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
hence why we couldn't dig any closer and

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.130 
hence why we couldn't dig any closer and
there<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.520> that's<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.510> Arkenstone

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
there you have it that's the Arkenstone

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.550 
there you have it that's the Arkenstone
and<00:03:44.680> really<00:03:45.010> simple<00:03:45.630> cop<00:03:46.630> mode<00:03:46.900> which<00:03:47.140> helps

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and really simple cop mode which helps

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.940 
and really simple cop mode which helps
it<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.130> compensate<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.380
