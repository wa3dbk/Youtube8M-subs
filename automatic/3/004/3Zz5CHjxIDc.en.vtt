00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello it's blandine mom hen 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.850
 today I was talking about hair 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.259
 for me my pregnancy because under 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.990
 the effect of the hormones the hair like 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 skin can change nature of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 textures and that's right it'll have to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 also so change your routine a little 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 beauty certainly be lucky 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 and will end up with hair 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.520
 much brighter in better 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.939
 health throughout the entire 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.470
 pregnancy 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.730
 others will have a little less 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.010
 chance with hair more what meaning 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 duller or even a little fatter 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510
 so there it will be necessary 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.099
 adapted his beauty routine to 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.170
 those who have hair that greases 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.120
 more quickly I advise you to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 wash with shampoos extremely 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 not at all aggressive like this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.920
 we love at mom's place 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 herbal shampoo descent shaun 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 war so 70% natural so it's a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 product that really is going to wash but has 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 not assaulted will not weigh down the fiber 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 capillary and daddy grease either the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 scalp 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.390
 so no like it very much 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 in that light, who does this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 that they asked him they had they in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.280
 did not do the phenomena by cons 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's true that if you have hair 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 rather bold I recommend you avoid 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.229
 frequent shampoos because one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.250
 wash your hair the more you need to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.479
 wash them and avoid too much friction 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 intense scalp because that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 stimulates the production of sebum 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.850
 for those who need to feed 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 the hair I selected three 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.220
 products or actions a little 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.729
 different 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.350
 the first one is the 100% pure oil 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.869
 water will see so that's the oil 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.930
 natural argan so is presented in 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 a small report isat hours so here we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 will use it to feed the choices in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290
 depth more to give them back a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 little brilliance so en masse that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
 stoned all night so small 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 valuations on the hair one gets 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 a mat we sleep with that it in the morning we 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.829
 wash your hair and have hair 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 fed and much brighter no 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.399
 more this oil the killer argan oil 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.280
 it can also be used in massage 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.280
 local for against stretch marks 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.219
 also the second product is the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 Intense restorative nourishing mask 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.420
 garnish 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.469
 so that's not a product is organic in 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.000
 however it is paraben free without 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.450
 phenoxyethanol but contains 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.530
 silicones so we will use it very little 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330
 frequently because he has a real 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.620
 action whose paths and for 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.540
 scenes when fine hair on the other hand 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.819
 the risks of increasing 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.069
 of the presence of silicone this being it 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.540
 feeds very well in depth so 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.099
 you can use it once a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.610
 week is enough to have enough 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.680
 hair healthier and finally 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.950
 the last favorite of mom hen 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.709
 it's the beautiful melting serra of 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.049
 So again a 99% natural 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.720
 which is that looks a little like a 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.099
 styling wax and that make in the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.440
 hand so is solid and who do in the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.390
 hand can use it before or after the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.120
 shampoo so that's something 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.459
 who will feed the fiber and who will gain 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 the hair so after we will have a material 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.440
 much easier to comb then and 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.989
 99% natural without paraben phenoxyethanol 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.430
 neither silicone is a super healthy product 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.200
 and hyper effective from the first 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.110
 use we see immediately the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 change on the material and longer 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.060
 term so on falling out more 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.639
 fed and finally a last tip 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.040
 it's true that fragile hair so 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.540
 we will also avoid the next ones 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.959
 hours the petition the colorations that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.120
 can attack and especially ensured 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.000
 have a good good diet because 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.180
 that the hair in fact is the reflection 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.380
 of food and finally I you 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.269
 advise to have a lot of patience 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.840
 because anyway once after 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.280
 childbirth 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 everything will return to order you 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.660
 will find your hair as before 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.069
