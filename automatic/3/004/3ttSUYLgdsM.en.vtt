00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.259
 the motorcycle tire test 2013 goes into the 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.359
 second round 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:23.570
 this time with the tours riding for big 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.570
 all-rounder like the suzuki bandit 12 50 s 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.570
 the bikes will be fresh soon 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.340
 brought and then it's already on 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.040
 the race track to our motorcycle 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.079
 service test boss jÃ¶rg lohse this time 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.079
 has energetic support it 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.980
 next to me is david steinmetz david 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.530
 steinmetz is the responsible of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.329
 sales director for dunlop motorcycle tires 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.780
 in Germany Austria and the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.100
 Switzerland 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 I habs now everything correctly said new 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.260
 federal states and so and yes we david 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.879
 are now here with you at your company 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.150
 Gast also tells you very briefly 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.640
 where we are here what this is we 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.380
 are beautiful in southern france 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.659
 I do not care where we got our former f1 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.570
 test track meanwhile have ours 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.049
 the center of our trip 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.880
 It is because it is mature and high-tech 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.860
 products is just the starting from rom 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.190
 especially important and here we have the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.320
 basic requirement to 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.450
 to represent normal real conditions 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.270
 can test that behavior 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.850
 as well as many drops behind 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 ok I think the topic wet grip 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.930
 or the night performance is straight 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 very interesting for touring drivers 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.780
 tour drivers come in bad times 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 weather they are on the road all year long 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.240
 what exactly can one do here on this 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 at all, that's how it works 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030
 beautiful on this route is one 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.570
 really simulates a rain covered 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.930
 roadway 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.950
 that means you can stay here 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.200
 continuously to those at the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 limits of mature work and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.760
 can control whether just in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.050
 mature announced in advance whether the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.890
 driver can react and that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.560
 we can in the development of 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.690
 flow in around these these 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.610
 reproducibility of the test 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.190
 conditions to use for the mature sun 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.080
 to find out that he is in wet conditions 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.700
 border area is slowly announcing and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 not in the abo slips around the driver 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.320
 just a balanced product too 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.530
 to provide something both dry 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.480
 as well as perfectly wet, that's okay 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.390
 Here are the words of David 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.860
 steinmetz in principle make ours 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.910
 test driver we make of the motorcycle exactly 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.620
 the same as the boys of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 Dunlop just do it here on the wet 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.290
 to test what's up with the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.690
 tire where the grip stops as announces 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.310
 the border area and and and what 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.770
 of course an important criterion 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.800
 and we are now at the end of the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.620
 tire tests then the usual 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.030
 ranking and finally it can 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.800
 actually only one winner and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.720
 Now we are curious who to 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.209
 close the crown here in the rain 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.260
 will have all the info as the six 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 candidates 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.060
 guys have beaten test who the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.409
 winner is in f12 on 24 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.239
 may 2013 the complete video will be released 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.239
 you can find it in the app
