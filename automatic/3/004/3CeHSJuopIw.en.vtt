we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.039 
we're going to talk a little bit about
how<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.400> size<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.000> right<00:00:06.210> paddle<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.930> your

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
how to size the right paddle for your

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.580 
how to size the right paddle for your
kayak<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> really<00:00:09.450> there's<00:00:09.750> only<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:10.110> four

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
kayak so really there's only about four

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.549 
kayak so really there's only about four
different<00:00:10.980> sizes<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.519> paddles<00:00:12.059> there's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.750> 210

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
different sizes of paddles there's a 210

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.529 
different sizes of paddles there's a 210
centimeter<00:00:14.750> 220<00:00:15.750> 230<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.039> 240<00:00:17.940> centimeter

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
centimeter 220 230 and 240 centimeter

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.290 
centimeter 220 230 and 240 centimeter
power<00:00:18.980> these<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.730> average

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
power these are really just average

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.769 
power these are really just average
sizes<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.289> specify<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.519> more<00:00:24.029> more

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
sizes you can specify a more more

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.429 
sizes you can specify a more more
distinct<00:00:25.500> size<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> 215<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> 216<00:00:27.810> but

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
distinct size like a 215 or a 216 but

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
distinct size like a 215 or a 216 but
for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> most<00:00:28.949> part<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.970> getting

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
for the most part if you're just getting

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
for the most part if you're just getting
out<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.050> starting<00:00:31.289> your

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
out and you're just starting your

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
out and you're just starting your
intermediate<00:00:32.520> paddler<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:33.690> four

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
intermediate paddler one of these four

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
intermediate paddler one of these four
sizes<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:35.219> than<00:00:35.430> good<00:00:35.520> enough<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
sizes more than good enough to get you a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.530 
sizes more than good enough to get you a
little<00:00:36.420> modern<00:00:36.780> having<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> great<00:00:37.380> time<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.540> how

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
little modern having a great time so how

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.209 
little modern having a great time so how
you<00:00:40.050> figure<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.379> what's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.920> size<00:00:41.190> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you figure out what's the right size for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
you figure out what's the right size for
you<00:00:41.579> there's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.270> few<00:00:42.540> different<00:00:42.809> things<00:00:42.930> three

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you there's a few different things three

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
you there's a few different things three
things<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> particular<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> width<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> your

things in particular the width of your

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
things in particular the width of your
boat<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.320> size<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> paddler<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
boat the size of the paddler and the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.869 
boat the size of the paddler and the
angle<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.870> hope<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> paddle<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.879> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
angle that you hope to paddle it the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
angle that you hope to paddle it the
width<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> boat<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> important<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> know

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
width of the boat is important to know

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.720 
width of the boat is important to know
when<00:00:52.559> you're<00:00:52.680> choosing<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.070> paddle<00:00:53.489> length

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
when you're choosing your paddle length

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
when you're choosing your paddle length
this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> perception<00:00:55.440> prodigy<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this is the perception prodigy it's in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
this is the perception prodigy it's in
our<00:00:56.309> recreational<00:00:56.969> class<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.750> boats<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
our recreational class of boats if you

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
our recreational class of boats if you
were<00:00:58.770> taking<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> prodigy<00:00:59.550> home<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.149> good

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
were taking the prodigy home it's good

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.360 
were taking the prodigy home it's good
to<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.809> 30<00:01:01.079> inches<00:01:01.199> wide<00:01:01.500> most

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to know it's 30 inches wide most

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.830 
to know it's 30 inches wide most
recreational<00:01:03.059> boats<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
recreational boats are a little on the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
recreational boats are a little on the
wide<00:01:04.080> side<00:01:04.110> they're<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.830> stable<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
wide side they're very stable so in this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
wide side they're very stable so in this
case<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.810> might<00:01:07.080> recommend<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
case I might recommend that you take a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.120 
case I might recommend that you take a
230<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> 240<00:01:09.990> centimeter<00:01:10.590> paddle

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
230 or a 240 centimeter paddle

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
230 or a 240 centimeter paddle
moving<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.530> Delta<00:01:13.740> kayak<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
moving over here the Delta kayak is a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
moving over here the Delta kayak is a
touring<00:01:15.960> kayak<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.799> 24<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> 25<00:01:17.670> inches<00:01:18.119> wide

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
touring kayak it's 24 to 25 inches wide

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
touring kayak it's 24 to 25 inches wide
so<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> case<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.340> something

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so in this case probably want something

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
so in this case probably want something
a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.060> shorter<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.900> 32<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> 20

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a little bit shorter to 32 to 20

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.149 
a little bit shorter to 32 to 20
centimeters<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.540> Solstice<00:01:24.780> GTS<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:26.040> bit

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
centimeters the Solstice GTS little bit

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
centimeters the Solstice GTS little bit
narrower<00:01:26.460> again<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> 22<00:01:27.450> inches<00:01:27.720> wide<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
narrower again it's 22 inches wide so in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.609 
narrower again it's 22 inches wide so in
this<00:01:28.710> case<00:01:28.950> shorter<00:01:29.640> paddle<00:01:29.970> 210<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> 220

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this case shorter paddle 210 to 220

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
this case shorter paddle 210 to 220
centimeters<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.720> next<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> consider

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
centimeters the next thing to consider

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
centimeters the next thing to consider
is<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.040> height<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.610> paddler<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.659> you're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is the height of your paddler if you're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
is the height of your paddler if you're
between<00:01:37.770> 5<00:01:38.280> feet<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> 5<00:01:38.970> 5<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.509> may<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
between 5 feet and 5 5 you may want to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.399 
between 5 feet and 5 5 you may want to
choose<00:01:40.049> 2<00:01:40.500> 10<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> 2<00:01:41.130> 20<00:01:41.490> centimeter<00:01:42.000> paddle<00:01:42.409> if

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
choose 2 10 to 2 20 centimeter paddle if

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
choose 2 10 to 2 20 centimeter paddle if
you're<00:01:43.590> 5<00:01:43.829> 5<00:01:44.399> 2<00:01:44.640> 5<00:01:44.790> 9
