sitting<00:00:46.860> nice<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.760> possible<00:00:48.620> without<00:00:49.620> having

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
sitting nice as possible without having

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a number one pick and hopefully we can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229 
a number one pick and hopefully we can
move<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> those<00:00:52.770> pics<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
move some of those pics and get into the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
move some of those pics and get into the
first<00:00:54.570> round<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.129> some<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> those

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
first round or we can use some of those

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
first round or we can use some of those
pics<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> pinpoint<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> player<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> we

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
pics to go and pinpoint a player that we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
pics to go and pinpoint a player that we
won't<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.910> see<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.300> moved<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
won't like can see when we moved up to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
won't like can see when we moved up to
get<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.199> t<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.520> year<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> think

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
get can t on that year and then I think

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
get can t on that year and then I think
we<00:01:03.420> did<00:01:03.570> last<00:01:03.750> year<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.110> Scandrick<00:01:04.530> also<00:01:04.890> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
we did last year for Scandrick also so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
we did last year for Scandrick also so
it<00:01:05.790> gives<00:01:05.970> us<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> room<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:07.110> able<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it gives us a lot of room to be able to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
it gives us a lot of room to be able to
maneuver<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> draft<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
maneuver in the draft so that's that's a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
maneuver in the draft so that's that's a
good<00:01:10.020> thing<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.770> bad<00:01:11.010> thing<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.720> we<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.930> a

played since that back injury who knows
if<00:01:57.570> he's<00:01:58.049> healthy<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.920> said<00:01:59.219> he<00:01:59.310> was<00:01:59.460> healthy

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
if he's healthy he said he was healthy

if he's healthy he said he was healthy
last<00:02:00.000> year<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> time<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> Lions

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
last year with the time with the Lions

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
last year with the time with the Lions
and<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> lion<00:02:02.130> said<00:02:02.430> his<00:02:02.579> condition<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and the lion said his condition was it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.550 
and the lion said his condition was it
an<00:02:03.810> acute<00:02:05.719> exacerbation<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.140> chronic

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
an acute exacerbation of a chronic

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.979 
an acute exacerbation of a chronic
condition<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.179> say<00:02:09.360> his<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
condition so they say his back is a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.420 
condition so they say his back is a
chronic<00:02:10.319> condition<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.340> how

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
chronic condition so I don't see how

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.730 
chronic condition so I don't see how
that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
that
be<00:02:12.120> fixed<00:02:13.120> easily<00:02:13.390> or<00:02:13.930> whatever<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.530> I'm

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
be fixed easily or whatever so I'm

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
be fixed easily or whatever so I'm
worried<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.780> his<00:02:17.200> health<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.920> I'm<00:02:18.250> not

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
worried about his health and I'm not

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.810 
worried about his health and I'm not
even<00:02:18.430> dealing<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:19.240> his<00:02:20.220> touchdown<00:02:21.220> to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
even dealing with his touchdown to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.490 
even dealing with his touchdown to
interception<00:02:21.850> ratio<00:02:22.600> there's<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.350> about

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
interception ratio there's just about

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.270 
interception ratio there's just about
even<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:25.630> would<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.320> backup
