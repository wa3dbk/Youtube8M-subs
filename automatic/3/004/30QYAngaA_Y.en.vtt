00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.450
 very good and that was dragon minecraft 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 rustlers a new joke and 1.81 point 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.930
 7.10 1.7 points 1.6 point 41 points 6.2 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 1.5 point 11.4 points 7 1.4 points 6 1 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.000
 point 4.5 and 1.4 point 2 and I'm dying of what 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.190
 you can breathe 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.599
 we are in the forest of the trees 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.550
 blinking as you are also seeing 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.440
 here behind me I'm dying because 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.160
 I'm seeing trees like epileptics 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.160
 behind him 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.030
 and the thing is good we have a way let's 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.190
 to return to the way that what it takes is a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.190
 little of the nerd ballet is very similar in 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.359
 How crazy is that good? 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.760
 Well in this case you know that the over 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.589
 world the eye of the en serves us to be able 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.019
 see about our position where 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.659
 is the strong which is worth then when 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.039
 let's go to the neder in this case then the 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.229
 black and what he's going to do is just 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.610
 the same but with lass sneijder for three 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.860
 so we're going to let black 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.170
 generate a new world is cleaning 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.429
 very much the good map in which 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.500
 I make the magazine that you are seeing what 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.659
 same is true so it will surely take 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.880
 a generally good time already generated and 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.490
 well almost almost almost now yes already 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.429
 finally generated and good because this 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.170
 what it does is tell us where the net is 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.200
 the nearest four 3 is worth simply 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.959
 let's give it a right click as you see 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.670
 launches and goes there then we 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.110
 let's continue let's continue to 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 here we are going to see let's find the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.979
 let's find and here is what 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.890
 coincidence what a surprise then well let's go 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.970
 to see at what point it gets to stop that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.259
 this one I also want it to be a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.190
 curiosity that I have and that we 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.690
 take to 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.060
 need for 3 that in this case has already 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.940
 taken but I want to see at what point it 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 for and if at some point it acts as the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.210
 eye of the en and descend or towards Asia 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.670
 where it can be is buried or what 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.710
 that is not in this case continues for here 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.510
 let's throw it here for example too 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.310
 has gotten here in the middle of the earth 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.440
 but for example let's go diaz here in 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 this part surprise bus takes us to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.990
 here a little more here we are going to remove 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.780
 a little here of net of track and we launched 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.780
 another one over here let's go a little bit 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.970
 more here we throw another one here is 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.390
 that does not go down that goes for 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 improve and now yes guys now yes we 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.980
 leads right to where we 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.930
 we wanted to go from the beginning we're going to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.110
 see if we can arrive just to 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.440
 that you see it worth it seems that it is here 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.180
 down yes 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.160
 exactly exactly I do not know if it will be 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.920
 there is just the refrigerator for three 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.240
 because a well yes and yes it is 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.130
 maspalomas still but good we are already 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.930
 in the photos and it does not matter anymore 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.340
 on the site things as you see 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.160
 this works and he 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.930
 It is very similar also to that of the eye 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.640
 simply instead of using powder 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 of blade we will use magma cream 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.160
 okay so I'm going to put on his new 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.220
 I'm going to put me here says January pearl 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 for example here to put the 64 cream 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.030
 of prawns and I make since nice to win everything 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.799
 what you can 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.840
 here more pearl of milk slogans of that 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.340
 is that I apologize but we just 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 finish doing a live 6 hours 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.480
 and 20 minutes and as you will understand now 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.980
 I have the mouth of that community 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.410
 it happens like a shoe right now the mouth 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.840
 I could not speak well not poor almost 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.569
 think I'm getting done one day and 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 means that we give ourselves but that is not 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.290
 your problem of the enemy problem 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.989
 so it 's good because we've seen 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.239
