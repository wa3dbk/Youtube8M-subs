00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.330
 hello how about in this video I'm going to talk 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.520
 what can we do if asia days or 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.760
 seasons we found the skin of the 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.560
 face as tired tired we see ourselves a 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.800
 tired face like that with little luminosity 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.540
 etcetera sometimes we have a bad face 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.870
 because we are in a time that we are 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.840
 sleeping badly or because we are eating 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.130
 bad is also very noticeable if we are 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.399
 at a time when we are 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.190
 stressed with anxiety with many 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.289
 worries with excess fatigue 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.710
 because we are in exam time what 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.660
 we're 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.390
 working too much in our work 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.879
 then it is to try to avoid the first 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.710
 which is the first thing these situations 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 I always say try to eat as much 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.949
 healthy as possible with as many 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 vitamins and minerals in your diet 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.820
 because it shows much the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 luminosity of the face if we are a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.329
 era that we are eating badly so 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.300
 that is at least buy yourself a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.060
 multivitamin in the pharmacy treats 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.220
 drink a lot of water every day about two 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 liters more or less than that we always 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 will keep the skin well hydrated and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 try not to smoke and drink alcohol because 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 that reflects a lot on the skin if 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 we have the skin always with a bad 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 aspect means we do not know 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 always as very dry if light very off 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.399
 little elastic with a color like very 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.979
 yellowish but continuous and continuous 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 it may be due to some internal problem 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.240
 example a problem of poisoning the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 liver because of a bad diet or 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 anything like that then what there is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 what to do is some cure 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.350
 detoxification like for example the one that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.930
 I commented here one day 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.759
 Of course to detoxify the skin 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.729
 that looks as well as smoother clean and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.070
 bright there is a super easy thing that is 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.070
 be taken every day in the morning in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 Fasting for a while before breakfast the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 juice of a lemon mixed with warm water 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.960
 and nothing better than the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.570
 nutricosmetics I also commented in a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.330
 previous video that this is what I put here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.090
 that I sometimes take evening primrose capsules 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.600
 of borage as yeast sometimes 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.330
 beer wheat germ capsules 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.100
 vitamin c take from time to time these 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.740
 add-ons are very noticeable in the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.110
 Very important skin for luminosity 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.150
 exfoliate the skin well and put some 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.670
 cleaning mask me for example me 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.010
 Exfoliates the skin once a week and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.810
 I take the opportunity to put myself at a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.270
 clay cleaning mask 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.790
 so what I do is first it's folio 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.560
 well the skin and when I already 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.600
 exfoliating and washing I put a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.640
 clay mask the truth that 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.430
 after this the skin looks much more 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 bright and clean and smooth in terms of 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.239
 brightness 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.910
 It is best to buy a cream with 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.520
 vitamin c you can go to the pharmacy and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.620
 many brands ask in your 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.300
 pharmacy for one that is advised 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.120
 pharmaceutical that is well priced and 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.590
 such any cream with vitamin c goes to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.930
 do a lot with the luminosity of your 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.970
 skin for special occasions in 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.730
 that we have a very bad face for whatever 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.610
 because we have not slept or something 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.769
 and we need to have a good face because it is 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
 a special occasion and let's go out or 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.000
 Let's go to a wedding and so on. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.680
 flash blister that is the best in the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.150
 pharmacy you will find a lot like 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.560
 the one of germinal that goes great I now 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.560
 same I am using this of endo care 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.140
 With these blisters the skin looks like it does not 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.260
 I know how very intense very stretched dims 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.330
 the signs of fatigue illuminates smoothes the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.220
 skin but that with fabric only occasionally 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.660
 special because with continuous use it 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.610
 it removes all the effect and besides that it does not go 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.310
 well for the skin yes we would like 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.500
 put us a flash blister but not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.270
 we have at home then what we can 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.460
 to do is to make the voucher with 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.750
 ingredients that we all have at home 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.750
 I put you now as 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.480
 if we get up in the morning and we 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 we see the face as well as off the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.190
 fastest remedy is to wash your face 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.250
 with water as cold as we can or 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.100
 even better with water that we will have 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.139
 added ice cubes we can also 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.810
 pass us an ice cube directly 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.940
 for the face but only a few seconds 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.979
 because if we are too long you can 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.750
 burn the skin burn in quotes 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.639
 ok what can happen is that we are going 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.430
 to irritate and we will have it during 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.320
 several days all irritated then yes 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.449
 we'll be quite a while happening to us 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.490
 the cube more than a few seconds what 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.220
 we can do is wrap it in a 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.510
 cloth or in a mass there is also more 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.510
 remedies that I put now 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.650
 apart from another thing that looks very good 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.440
 is to be quite a while making a 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.350
 massage be at least 10 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.710
 Minutes before leaving or what 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.950
 be a cream put on an oil and 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.050
 anything that is very useful already 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.080
 circular movements these 10 minutes 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.480
 clock without stopping after that time 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.430
 of massage you're going to see how you're going to have 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.680
 the skin with much better color because 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.320
 we have activated the circulation 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.270
 another thing we can do is if we go 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.820
 to go out and we see that we have a bad face 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.520
 we put ourselves a little before leaving a 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.550
 mask for example type is that 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.580
 I have de nivea visage this is with 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.560
 vitamins 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.560
 I also have this mercadona 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.250
 but good they usually go well but one thing 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.410
 which is even cheaper and that to me 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.970
 It's great but I have dry skin 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.210
 for oily skin I think this is not going 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.760
 very well taken care of is I put myself in the snowy 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.880
 of the blue tin the line of all life 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.030
 I put on a goop or whatever 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.010
 the white face and I'm while I'm leaving 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.710
 dressing while preparing the 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.810
 bag or whatever to get it out I have it 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.880
 in the face we see about 10 minutes later 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.760
 I remove the excess with a tissue with a 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.070
 paper handkerchief and what little is left 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.750
 Well, I extend it well, making a 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.320
 small massage and the truth that to me 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.180
 the super hydrated luxury skin is left 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.950
 apart and natural remedies that the 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.050
 we can do with ingredients that all 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.389
 we have at home that are super easy to 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.590
 do and that also leave super skin 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.590
 well do not we put now 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.490
 another thing we can do is if we 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.140
 we go to bed at night and we know that 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.440
 let's sleep very little hours like this 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.690
 we're going to wake up looking tired 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.910
 put on when you put an oil on your face 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.710
 any oil goes well the oil of 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.260
 virgin olive that we all have at home 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:12.280
 is the most commonly used germ oil of 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.650
 wheat goes great almond argan yes 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.530
 we have oily skin because it uses the 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.170
 jojoba or hazelnut when you wake up you go 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.990
 to find the skin as super-smooth 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.960
 hydrated and then still better than 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.820
 oil that is sold in pharmacies is 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.820
 pearls of ausina or more 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:36.110
 these pearls in principle are not for 

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:37.879
 put on the skin I have commented on 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.339
 other videos because I like them a lot 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.349
 they are to take in reality but as 

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:44.689
 come in pearls what you do is the 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:48.800
 you click and you which on the skin like 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:50.269
 is vitamin a plus and that is pure then you 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.830
 will leave a great skin and when you 

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:54.529
 you will find her super 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.629
 well and nothing this was all for today I hope 

00:07:54.529 --> 00:08:00.429
 that you liked the video very many 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:00.429
 thanks for watching me and see you another day
