00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.859
 But still, we should not care 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.620

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.940

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.950
 time you have one or two over the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 Thirsty and the next morning 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.570
 I was overcome with such a feeling of hunger 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.920
 The looked in the fridge must with 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 to realize scare 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.620
 you do not even have that much in there 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 So far, they have been salmon and poplar 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 then have to walk away okay what are you doing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 do you have the hot toast and right 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.510
 We'll do that in the first one 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.680
 step have a slice of toast 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.940
 taken the nice with butter 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.030
 smeared and the equip now 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.140
 First we have properly now 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 cut into mushrooms here in mushrooms 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.250
 where too German it is actually a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.649
 egeling or gerling 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 but for me is great but I want 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.310
 now, of course, just over it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 Let's write cut the slices like that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 about seven centimeters more 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.940
 then the mushrooms on the grill 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 lay and brood but what they do 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.090
 Consider is such a fungus that exists 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 90 percent water 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.270
 that means he wants to be really hot 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.330
 so that we are really beautiful 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.160
 get toasted but before we do 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.479
 that must be our beautiful 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.030
 trust first down oh yes as you see 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.880
 wonderfully felt so I love it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 and the most beautiful toast in the world 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 will be neat with cream now 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.369
 horseradish smeared 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 Do not be so frugal we want here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.770
 what taste and in a circle then you say 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.170
 Hear him how crispy this page is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.179
 and that's the great one side 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.580
 crispy the other side is soft 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.899
 that is a really cool consistency 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.899
 So I think that's really great 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 after we get the frustration neat now 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.110
 have smeared with his erotic 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.700
 Let's put them with smoked salmon myself 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.220
 I now have relatively high quality 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.410
 taken the pack some ask me 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.440
 also about sketches of luxair set is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.570
 it is much cheaper but it tastes good 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.280
 totally modest, I 'm getting involved 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.790
 do not want red wine drink cherry juice 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.650
 novella is red or so now if you like us 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.620
 The mushrooms we have four times 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.860
 piece and pack the waffles on the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 grill 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.480
 that does not take long now 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.230
 approximately from each side approximately 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.830
 one and a half minutes in between 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.910
 turned around 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 then also are almost done 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.220
 so the salmon is still a bit 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.379
 With pepper salt I do them now 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 not anymore because I'm already relatively salty 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.560
 but it is also our all erotic 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.519
 salt in it and that would be personal to me 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.680
 too much now 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.080
 Of course you can salt if you want 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.129
 want is all no problem as a 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.989
 a little pepper on it a bit 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.849
 lemon on it and then come the mushrooms 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 on top 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.569
 because it is now infinitely long again 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.959
 taken abschÃ¼tz keeps you joke again 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.700
 because beautiful so sitting woman in 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.340
 the subway comes to it says the woman 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.340
 i as gabi i did not say mandla 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.720
 quiet in the comments bit 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.970
 Rant so we build our head 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.950
 Now turn around and make the grill pan 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.260
 on it because we want one now 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.239
 to make a mirror and we give in to it 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.540
 Add butter to the pan and leave 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.540
 they melt 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.700
 and then lubmin 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.579
 that sounds great and looks great to me 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.049
 you will turn around now because 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.939
 I love you so much you can of course 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.439
 even roast from one side or from 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.319
 Both sides roast that remains for you 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.840
 leave 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.689
 and when that one is done, that comes 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.689
 mirroring the salmon on it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.810
 so now we have a thing 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.820
 I have fresh food here 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.190
 chives we will become small 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.190
 cut or chop small 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.560
 and then we give it over the consolation 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.870
