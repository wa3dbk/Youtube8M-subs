00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.220
 the first FC Kaiserslautern against Hannover 96 40 000 spectators in the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 fritz-walter-stadion hope after last four winless play finally 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.730
 back to a sense of achievement for the red devils 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.709
 the FC was equal in the forward gear 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.269
 Langquaid is on it 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.490
 Fromlowitz reaction plays strong image in the margin 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.699
 and again from 06 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.949
 Florian Fromlowitz himself once student of the legendary Lauterer goalkeeper school 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.160
 Gerry Ehrmann confirms his great form to me on the twelfth minute 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.250
 Hannover he defensively oriented but always with relief attacks 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 Schmiedebach survives in the middle, Abdellaoue meets us 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.920
 the guests lead with one to zero 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 33 minutes are played 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.720
 Mohammed Abdellaoue with season number four current Loafers 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.310
 most successful scorer 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.310
 just before the break, the food single-handedly 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.660
 Fromlowitz is beaten but the post saves for the 96ers 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 it remains at the extremely happy guest guide to break 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 To recognize some 6 90 can hardly believe 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.659
 cautious start in half time two it takes up to 61 minutes 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 the tips from a distance 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.030
 a quarter of an hour before the end it's much more dangerous 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 he has now returns 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 directly reduced Migliaccio x add extra shot 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 the FCK with the big chance to balance Butlowitz and his own 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.280
 Inability Zehnder the long overdue one on one 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.190
 four minutes later, the Pelzer again with the times today you can 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.100
 per capita 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
 scarcer the scale 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.709
 The ball just does not want to score Hannover remains under pressure 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829
 Pierre minutes before the final whistle still at Kaiserslautern 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.299
 Tifferts with a nice individual action 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.729
 comes to flanks 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.729
 but Loughridge does not hit the ball properly 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.739
 the FCK with chances in the minute but 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 the well-deserved balance just will not fall 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.939
 then it is over then it remains then only to 1 already the third defeat of the 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.419
 Ascender in the last four games 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.729
 Hannover drops a total of 13 points and third place at the season start the 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.639
 There have never been at the Lower Saxony
