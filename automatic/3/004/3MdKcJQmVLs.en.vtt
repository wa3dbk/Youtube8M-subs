00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.059 
pull up one hey that one's kind of
stunted<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:44.290> kind<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.560> short<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:47.069> funny

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
stunted it's kind of short and funny

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.180 
stunted it's kind of short and funny
looking<00:03:49.080> kinda<00:03:50.080> has<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> little<00:03:50.410> line<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.069> the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
looking kinda has a little line to the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280 
looking kinda has a little line to the
middle<00:03:51.420> almost<00:03:52.420> like<00:03:52.569> if<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.870> was<00:03:52.989> cut<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
middle almost like if it was cut and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
middle almost like if it was cut and
then<00:03:53.590> put<00:03:53.620> back<00:03:53.950> together<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:55.150> these<00:03:55.330> are<00:03:55.569> just

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
then put back together so these are just

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.530 
then put back together so these are just
these<00:03:55.930> little<00:03:56.380> tiny<00:03:56.920> shorties<00:03:57.640> then<00:03:58.360> this

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
these little tiny shorties then this

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.820 
these little tiny shorties then this
one's<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.810> little<00:03:58.959> bit<00:03:59.140> longer<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.500> there's

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
one's a little bit longer so there's

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.039 
one's a little bit longer so there's
like<00:03:59.980> difference<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.580> sizes<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:01.510> depends<00:04:01.989> on

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
like difference in sizes it depends on

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.960 
like difference in sizes it depends on
how<00:04:02.350> they<00:04:02.530> grow<00:04:02.799> there's<00:04:03.160> just<00:04:03.280> differences

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
how they grow there's just differences

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.970 
how they grow there's just differences
so<00:04:04.480> will<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.810> really<00:04:05.110> long<00:04:05.290> like<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.799> and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
so will be really long like that and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.640 
so will be really long like that and
some<00:04:06.160> will<00:04:06.310> be<00:04:06.340> really<00:04:06.730> short<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.209> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
some will be really short like that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.970 
some will be really short like that
that's<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.769> really<00:04:09.430> tiny<00:04:09.700> carrot<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.560> these<00:04:11.739> are

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
that's a really tiny carrot so these are

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.110 
that's a really tiny carrot so these are
hopes<00:04:12.190> if<00:04:12.430> they're<00:04:12.580> orange<00:04:12.910> on<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.030> inside

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120
