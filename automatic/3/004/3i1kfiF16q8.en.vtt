00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a RadioShack I picked up so if I can get

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.889 
a RadioShack I picked up so if I can get
things<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> here

things out of here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.040 
things out of here
I<00:00:52.520> put<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.730> connectors<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> end

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I put your connectors on this end

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
I put your connectors on this end
standard<00:00:55.620> connector<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.640> an

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
standard connector right there and an

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
standard connector right there and an
alligator<00:00:57.120> clip<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.140> end<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> I've

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
alligator clip on the other end and I've

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.319 
alligator clip on the other end and I've
got<00:00:59.789> both<00:01:00.000> situations<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.859> could<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.329> as

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
got both situations so I could just as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
got both situations so I could just as
you<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.170> I've<00:01:04.350> done<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.100> picked

you see the way I've done this I picked

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
you see the way I've done this I picked
some<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.119> surplus<00:01:06.659> these

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
some of these up surplus these

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560 
some of these up surplus these
connectors<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.250> plug<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
connectors here so I can just plug it in

you don't have to have these connectors
you<00:01:11.220> could<00:01:11.369> run<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> directly<00:01:12.150> off<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you could run it directly off of your

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
you could run it directly off of your
power<00:01:13.380> supply<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> wanted<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.450> did

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
power supply if you wanted to I just did

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.410 
power supply if you wanted to I just did
this<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.930> convenience<00:01:16.530> sake<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.920 
this for convenience sake now when I
built<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.200> bow<00:01:20.150> for<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.270> wing<00:01:21.479> cutter

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
built my bow for my wing cutter

then I've just taken him I I stretched
my<00:01:42.600> wire<00:01:42.899> over<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> top<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.280> simple

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
my wire over the top this is a simple

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
my wire over the top this is a simple
bright<00:01:45.240> wire<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.810> picked<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> hobby

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
bright wire that I picked up at a hobby

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.270

stop<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> Roberts<00:01:49.229> crafts<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.159> we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
stop you know Roberts crafts I think we

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.319 
stop you know Roberts crafts I think we
got<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.210> 26<00:01:51.840> gauge<00:01:52.579> very<00:01:53.579> very<00:01:53.790> light

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
got that it's 26 gauge very very light

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.350 
got that it's 26 gauge very very light
wire<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.579> if<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> brake<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.149> not

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
wire I like this if you brake it's not

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.990 
wire I like this if you brake it's not
big<00:01:57.600> deals<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.350> expensive<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.250> usually

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
big deals not very expensive I usually

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
big deals not very expensive I usually
use<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.450> heavier<00:02:00.750> gauge<00:02:01.020> than<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> 26

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
use a little heavier gauge than the 26

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
use a little heavier gauge than the 26
but<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.850> usually<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.390> I've<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.659> longer

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
but it's usually because I've got longer

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
but it's usually because I've got longer
I'm<00:02:05.100> cutting<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.719> simply

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
to measure I don't want to heat up any

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.650 
to measure I don't want to heat up any
more<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.049> wire<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.560> absolutely<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:32.430> to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
more the wire that I absolutely have to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.180 
more the wire that I absolutely have to
so<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> measure<00:03:34.260> where<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.919> one's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
so I'm going to measure where this one's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.550 
so I'm going to measure where this one's
going<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:35.910> side<00:03:36.150> you'll<00:03:36.989> watch<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
going on this side you'll watch the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500 
going on this side you'll watch the
spark<00:03:38.040> that's<00:03:38.280> generated<00:03:38.910> when<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> put<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.389> up

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
spark that's generated when I put it up

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.900

there<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.019> up<00:03:40.079> off<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.260> computer

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
there get it up off that computer

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.080 
there get it up off that computer
get<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.000> hand<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:42.480> wasting<00:03:42.840> set<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.910> see

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
get my hand on the wasting set you see

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.830

the spark as it powers up that wire and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.780 
the spark as it powers up that wire and
it'll<00:03:48.989> start<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.440> heat<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.919> wire<00:03:50.220> up<00:03:50.579> now

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
it'll start to heat that wire up now
