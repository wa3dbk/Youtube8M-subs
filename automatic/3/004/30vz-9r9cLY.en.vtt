so as our skis go through production we

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.540 
so as our skis go through production we
insert<00:00:41.750> an<00:00:41.930> NFC<00:00:42.350> chip<00:00:42.380> into<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:42.920> actual<00:00:43.310> ski

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
insert an NFC chip into the actual ski

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.060 
insert an NFC chip into the actual ski
and<00:00:44.450> then<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:44.720> data<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.170> then<00:00:45.350> stored<00:00:45.650> in<00:00:45.980> our

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
and then that data is then stored in our

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.979 
and then that data is then stored in our
system<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.730> can<00:00:46.910> absolutely<00:00:47.059> upload<00:00:47.780> all

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
system and we can absolutely upload all

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.990 
system and we can absolutely upload all
that<00:00:48.140> info<00:00:48.470> as<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.160> production<00:00:49.520> process

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
that info as the production process

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.880 
that info as the production process
happens<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.480> we<00:00:50.570> get<00:00:50.690> real-time<00:00:50.930> data<00:00:51.410> we

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
happens so we get real-time data we

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.410 
happens so we get real-time data we
compare<00:00:52.250> our<00:00:52.370> products<00:00:52.790> together<00:00:53.000> more

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
compare our products together more

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.960 
compare our products together more
perfectly<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.949> result<00:00:55.250> for<00:00:55.400> us<00:00:55.520> means<00:00:55.760> we're

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
perfectly and result for us means we're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.220 
perfectly and result for us means we're
more<00:00:56.150> accountable<00:00:56.600> for<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.809> products<00:00:57.140> in

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
more accountable for the products in

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.990 
more accountable for the products in
producing<00:00:57.680> when<00:00:58.190> they<00:00:58.280> come<00:00:58.460> out<00:00:58.610> at<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> end

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
producing when they come out at the end

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.580 
producing when they come out at the end
through<00:00:59.660> finishing<00:01:00.140> they're<00:01:00.350> paired

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
through finishing they're paired

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.509 
through finishing they're paired
together<00:01:00.710> perfectly

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
together perfectly

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.220 
together perfectly
and<00:01:01.730> then<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.030> take<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.720> whole<00:01:02.960> process

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
and then we take that that whole process

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.770 
and then we take that that whole process
and<00:01:03.830> we<00:01:03.920> built<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.519> retailer<00:01:05.210> version<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
and we built a retailer version and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.780 
and we built a retailer version and
that's<00:01:05.990> what<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.260> tablet<00:01:06.650> shows<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.670> what

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
that's what this tablet shows and what

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.240 
that's what this tablet shows and what
that<00:01:07.970> does<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.540> enables<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.800> whole

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
that does is it enables the whole

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.830 
that does is it enables the whole
transaction<00:01:10.790> process<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.450> much<00:01:11.690> more

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
transaction process so much more

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.230 
transaction process so much more
seamless<00:01:12.110> much<00:01:12.560> quicker<00:01:12.830> at<00:01:13.100> retail<00:01:13.490> enables

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
seamless much quicker at retail enables

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.600 
seamless much quicker at retail enables
retailers<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.840> better<00:01:15.050> prepare<00:01:15.920> speeds<00:01:16.430> for

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
retailers to better prepare speeds for

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.219 
retailers to better prepare speeds for
the<00:01:16.640> customer<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.240> turn<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.720> customer<00:01:18.080> leads

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
the customer and turn the customer leads

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.380 
the customer and turn the customer leads
more<00:01:18.410> satisfied<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.399> third<00:01:19.670> tier

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
more satisfied and then the third tier

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.810 
more satisfied and then the third tier
of<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:21.140> really<00:01:21.590> putting<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:22.520> power

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
of that is really putting that power

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.790 
of that is really putting that power
that<00:01:23.119> consumers<00:01:23.539> hand<00:01:23.750> through<00:01:24.410> our<00:01:24.530> mind

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
that consumers hand through our mind

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800 
that consumers hand through our mind
balances<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:25.910> that's<00:01:26.450> something<00:01:26.660> they'll

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
balances and so that's something they'll

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.300 
balances and so that's something they'll
be<00:01:26.930> launching<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:27.500> fall<00:01:27.740> when<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.130> website
