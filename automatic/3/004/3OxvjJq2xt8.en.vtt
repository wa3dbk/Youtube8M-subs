00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.370
 Ice cold make everything clear 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.309
 Who would he be without a cell phone a week? 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.680

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.420
 if the question has asked 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:36.399
 Nokia was really funny, I think 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.399
 So people needed but 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.220

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.799

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:16.970

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.010

 take a shower in the week 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.299
 Why 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:52.319

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.890

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.630
 you know 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.810
 and my video does not drive the social 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.590

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.970

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.030

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.010
