here<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.459> like<00:02:10.610> buzzer<00:02:10.910> how<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.420> feeling<00:02:11.840> good

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
here in like buzzer how you feeling good

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.590 
here in like buzzer how you feeling good
good<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.730> I'm<00:02:13.910> gonna<00:02:14.060> ask<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.420> once

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
good as you like I'm gonna ask you once

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.930 
good as you like I'm gonna ask you once
to<00:02:14.780> walk<00:02:14.959> slowly<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.350> purpose<00:02:15.709> it's<00:02:16.400> okay<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to walk slowly a purpose it's okay I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.670 
to walk slowly a purpose it's okay I
think<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.630> quite<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.840> nice<00:02:17.990> package<00:02:18.290> -<00:02:18.500> quite

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
think it's quite a nice package - quite

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.630 
think it's quite a nice package - quite
a<00:02:18.709> nice<00:02:18.920> start<00:02:19.190> for<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.880> new<00:02:20.060> team<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.770> think

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
a nice start for a new team and I think

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.070 
a nice start for a new team and I think
there<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.910> lot<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.150> stuff<00:02:23.450> which<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.690> coming

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
there is a lot of stuff which is coming

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.199 
there is a lot of stuff which is coming
up<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> season<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.490> we're<00:02:26.090> really

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
up in the season and we're really

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.540 
up in the season and we're really
looking<00:02:26.330> forward<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.110> be<00:02:27.260> first<00:02:28.040> time

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.699 

from<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.700> season<00:02:32.150> -<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.110> minutes<00:02:33.440> more<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
from this season - more minutes more the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.850 
from this season - more minutes more the
challenge<00:02:34.570> than<00:02:35.570> anything<00:02:36.290> else<00:02:36.530> everyone

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
challenge than anything else everyone

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.230 
challenge than anything else everyone
knows<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.250> difficult

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
knows it's difficult

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.430 
knows it's difficult
and<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:40.020> meant<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.380> easy<00:02:40.730> either<00:02:41.730> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
and it's not meant to be easy either and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.930 
and it's not meant to be easy either and
so<00:02:43.440> for<00:02:43.650> us<00:02:43.740> it's<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.980> challenged<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.610> virgin

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
so for us it's a challenged in a virgin

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
so for us it's a challenged in a virgin
like<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> challenge<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> match<00:02:46.140> there

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
like a challenge that is a match there

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.640 
like a challenge that is a match there
and<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.920> be<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> case<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:51.650> running

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
and it's going to be a case of running

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.050 
and it's going to be a case of running
reliably<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.210> chipping<00:02:54.630> away

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.449 

in<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.420> past<00:02:59.690> five<00:02:59.990> hours<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.890> hasn't<00:03:01.310> moved

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
in the past five hours it hasn't moved

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.860 
in the past five hours it hasn't moved

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
I'm sure I'm watching waiting out of the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.750 
I'm sure I'm watching waiting out of the
photos<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.680> taken<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.310> cart<00:03:07.610> what

photos have you taken to this cart what
about<00:03:08.590> no<00:03:09.590> loads<00:03:10.000> probably<00:03:11.000> about<00:03:12.100> today<00:03:13.100> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
about no loads probably about today of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.250 
about no loads probably about today of
the<00:03:13.520> car<00:03:13.760> yeah<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.450> couple<00:03:14.750> hundred<00:03:14.930> degrees

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the car yeah a couple hundred degrees

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.360 
the car yeah a couple hundred degrees
for<00:03:15.980> about<00:03:16.069> four<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.660> I'm<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.860> sure<00:03:22.040> what<00:03:22.250> I'm

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
for about four and I'm not sure what I'm

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.100 
for about four and I'm not sure what I'm
looking<00:03:22.700> at<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.180> tell<00:03:23.450> me<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.660> back<00:03:23.840> end

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
looking at but you tell me the back end

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.110 
looking at but you tell me the back end
is<00:03:24.230> where<00:03:24.470> all<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.010> magic<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.850> I'll<00:03:25.970> follow

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
is where all the magic is so I'll follow

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.840 
is where all the magic is so I'll follow
but<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.450> have<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.569> sneaky<00:03:26.930> peek<00:03:27.080> yeah<00:03:27.800> this<00:03:28.670> is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
but I have a sneaky peek yeah this is

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.080 
but I have a sneaky peek yeah this is
our<00:03:29.030> interpretation<00:03:29.360> of<00:03:29.959> film<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.850> 2010<00:03:31.850> rear

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
our interpretation of film of 2010 rear

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.790 
our interpretation of film of 2010 rear
end<00:03:32.300> kind<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> bit<00:03:33.350> different<00:03:33.620> from<00:03:33.680> other

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
end kind of a bit different from other

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.220 
end kind of a bit different from other
people's<00:03:34.310> but<00:03:34.580> his<00:03:35.120> basis<00:03:35.630> for<00:03:35.810> development

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
people's but his basis for development

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.000 
people's but his basis for development
and<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:37.430> CFD<00:03:38.060> design<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.560> like<00:03:39.769> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
and it's all CFD design is that like the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.650 
and it's all CFD design is that like the
giant<00:03:40.340> leap<00:03:40.459> for<00:03:40.790> f1<00:03:41.090> or<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.420> just<00:03:41.570> a

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
giant leap for f1 or is it just a

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.960 
giant leap for f1 or is it just a
fitness<00:03:42.019> mobster<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> giant<00:03:43.640> leap

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
fitness mobster I think the giant leap

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.650 
fitness mobster I think the giant leap
really<00:03:44.450> is<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:45.050> relying<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.810> without<00:03:47.810> any

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
really is is relying on it without any

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.020 
really is is relying on it without any
lost<00:03:50.050> all<00:03:50.260> compassion

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
lost all compassion

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.400 
lost all compassion
interesting<00:03:53.030> hands<00:03:53.180> like

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.810 

so<00:04:00.410> we're<00:04:00.800> pretty<00:04:00.920> useful<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.670> we're

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
so we're pretty useful and we're

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.010 
so we're pretty useful and we're
confident<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.540> says<00:04:04.390> shall<00:04:05.390> not<00:04:05.600> see<00:04:05.900> how

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
confident that it says shall not see how

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.480 
confident that it says shall not see how
they've<00:04:06.170> got<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.530> close<00:04:06.770> to<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.220> principle

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
they've got this close to it a principle

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.610 
they've got this close to it a principle
of<00:04:08.270> in<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.540> position<00:04:08.960> that<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.170> like<00:04:09.320> but

of in this position that you like but

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.160 
of in this position that you like but
there<00:04:09.740> is<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.890> reason<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.520> we<00:04:10.670> down<00:04:10.910> here<00:04:11.180> have

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
there is a reason that we down here have

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.800 
there is a reason that we down here have
