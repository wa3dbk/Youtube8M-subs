00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.820
 we have talked with each of 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.350
 They have made it clear to them 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.969
 institution to which the seriousness arrive 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.620
 with which we all work and go 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.939
 we are implementing a 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.590
 internal regulation that all 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.779
 players are signing at the time of 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.700
 his contract and there comes that any 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.369
 serious failure or whatever the institution 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.470
 may be ceased from this same clear 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.750
 of course a series comes as I tell you it's a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.310
 very complete regulation where you will avoid 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.100
 all that kind of situations like the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.320
 agreed with freddy well very happy 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.300
 The truth is that I believe that with all 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.890
 the changes are good fortunately 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.110
 are giving us things we have done a 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 good work extra court obviously in 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.309
 teacher marin's court and he comes with 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.780
 an incredible desire to excel with 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.670
 the institution like the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.800
 players and well let's hope that this 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.690
 formula and this change is positive and the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.340
 people are happy with this what 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.570
 we search 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.380
 this new era what 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.600
 we pose with a crowd 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.760
 the first thing I think is to balance the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 Percentage theme as I have said 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.720
 I think that from that we can 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.880
 work different things here in 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
 populate once with this theme as you 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.780
 I repeat balanced as we can think 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.280
 in doing different things and working 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.020
 in a special way that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.360
 unfortunately we had not been given 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.830
 for this matter of being there always in the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.270
 percent issue had I think we've 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.740
 made very good team and good we are 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.020
 anxious because the tournament starts and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.910
 to be able to demonstrate it on the court well 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.610
 The sale of fertilizers is very good and 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.080

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.030

 good job that your team is going to leave it 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.470
