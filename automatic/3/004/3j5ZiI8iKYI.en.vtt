excessive redness if it feels hot to the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.250 
excessive redness if it feels hot to the
touch<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.880> definitely<00:02:35.299> want<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> notify<00:02:35.900> your

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
doctor of that and you want to keep them

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.610 
doctor of that and you want to keep them
from<00:02:39.950> licking<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.609> if<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.180> lick<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.840> it's

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
from licking this if they lick this it's

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.590 
from licking this if they lick this it's
going<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.130> very<00:02:43.640> swollen

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
going to get very swollen

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.920 
going to get very swollen
very<00:02:45.260> red<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.120> ultimately<00:02:47.120> very<00:02:47.690> infected

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
very red and ultimately very infected

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
very red and ultimately very infected
so<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:50.370> would<00:02:51.299> just<00:02:51.329> recommend<00:02:51.629> if<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:53.040> can't

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so I would just recommend if you can't

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.699 
so I would just recommend if you can't
keep<00:02:53.459> an<00:02:53.610> eye<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.790> them<00:02:54.209> put<00:02:54.900> Elizabethan

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
keep an eye on them put Elizabethan

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.729 
keep an eye on them put Elizabethan
collar<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.390> watch<00:02:57.629> them<00:02:57.989> just

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
collar on if you can watch them just

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.869 
collar on if you can watch them just
make<00:02:58.920> sure<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.430> don't<00:02:59.549> have<00:02:59.640> any

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
make sure that they don't have any

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:09.259 
make sure that they don't have any
interest<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.569> incision<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
interest in that incision this is

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.059 
interest in that incision this is
typical<00:03:10.129> you're<00:03:11.129> going<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.430> cry<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> little<00:03:12.060> bit

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
typical you're going to cry a little bit

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.250 
typical you're going to cry a little bit
and<00:03:14.090> sometimes<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.420> has<00:03:15.540> nothing<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.140> with

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and sometimes it has nothing to do with

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.069 
and sometimes it has nothing to do with
the<00:03:16.680> actual<00:03:16.980> discomfort<00:03:17.700> sometimes<00:03:18.689> it's

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
the actual discomfort sometimes it's

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.630 
the actual discomfort sometimes it's
because<00:03:19.319> they're<00:03:19.620> under<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.920> influence<00:03:20.010> of

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
because they're under the influence of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.289 
because they're under the influence of
drugs<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.680> she<00:03:22.680> had<00:03:23.040> something<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.060> similar

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
drugs and she had something very similar

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.479 
drugs and she had something very similar
to<00:03:24.420> morphine<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.889> can<00:03:26.010> change<00:03:26.040> their

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
to morphine and it can change their

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.930 
to morphine and it can change their
behavior<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.790> keep<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
behavior so you just have to keep in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.240 
behavior so you just have to keep in
mind<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.540> sometimes<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:32.069> has

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
mind that sometimes it really has

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.699 
mind that sometimes it really has
nothing<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.579> do<00:03:32.819> with<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.500> she's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
nothing to do with this it's just she's

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.390 
nothing to do with this it's just she's
feeling<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.250> weird<00:03:35.819> right<00:03:36.239> now<00:03:37.250> one<00:03:38.250> thing

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
feeling really weird right now one thing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.490 
feeling really weird right now one thing
I<00:03:38.519> wanted<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.879> mention<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.810> they<00:03:39.989> might<00:03:40.200> send
