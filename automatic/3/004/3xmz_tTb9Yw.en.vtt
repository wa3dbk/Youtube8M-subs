00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
the court order and it seems as though
the<00:01:48.840> prosecution<00:01:49.649> knew<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.579> least

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the prosecution knew about this at least

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.200 
the prosecution knew about this at least
for<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> last<00:01:51.720> several<00:01:52.110> months<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.340> yet<00:01:53.700> has

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
for the last several months but yet has

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.560 
for the last several months but yet has
not<00:01:54.390> done<00:01:54.810> anything<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.979> information

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
not done anything with this information

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.069 
not done anything with this information
except<00:01:57.570> offer

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079

except offer
I<00:01:58.290> guess<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.549> different<00:02:00.210> iterations<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I guess now two different iterations of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.190 
I guess now two different iterations of
a<00:02:01.350> deals<00:02:02.009> try<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> resolve<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> case<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.930> again

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
a deals try to resolve the case so again

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.109 
a deals try to resolve the case so again
why<00:02:04.649> didn't<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.189> anything<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
why didn't they do anything with it do

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.540 
why didn't they do anything with it do
they<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.390> think<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.079> any

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
they not think that there is any

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
they not think that there is any
potential<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> victim<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.379> any

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
potential that this victim is in any

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.220 
potential that this victim is in any
danger<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.390> strange<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.959> every

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
danger so it is very strange and every

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.490 
danger so it is very strange and every
day

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
day

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890 
day
is<00:02:13.680> another<00:02:14.220> twist<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> yet<00:02:15.750> another

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
is another twist and this is yet another

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.470 
is another twist and this is yet another
bizarre<00:02:16.410> twist<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.580> tomorrow<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.330> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
bizarre twist but tomorrow I think it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.030 
bizarre twist but tomorrow I think it's
going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:19.020> telling<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.440> see<00:02:19.710> how

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
going to be very telling to see how

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.310 
going to be very telling to see how

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
seriously the judge is taking these

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.650 
seriously the judge is taking these
