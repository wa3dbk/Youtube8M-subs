so<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.540> extend<00:01:22.110> your<00:01:22.409> peony<00:01:22.950> season<00:01:24.110> so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
so they extend your peony season so

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
so they extend your peony season so
we're<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.259> gonna<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> quick<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.549> at
