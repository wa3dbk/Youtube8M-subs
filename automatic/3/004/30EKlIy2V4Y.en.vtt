00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 the fc schalke is running for the season start 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.580
 against and the fans are watching closely 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.519
 how the team presents itself 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.670
 since this season also adams 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.340
 the 25-year-old hungarian came for around 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.670
 eight million euros from mainz mainz and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 schalke 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:31.650
 the difference is large with more 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.710
 quality of course and and of course 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.280
 but there is behind it that the schalke 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 must win in every game so in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 each has to play are good and we 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 play every game to win i have 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 I had great years in Mainz only 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.520
 i can only do everything mainz thought 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.920
 but i wanted this next step 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 make and this is equal to a huge 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.000
 there is a difference 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.199
 but I am ready for it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 after two training camps and nine 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 Test games is the preparation almost 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 over as satisfied and has become 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 quickly integrated well into the team 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.340
 Overall , I feel fine 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 First few weeks I said that very much 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.409
 am happy that I can be here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.430
 help with the team 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.259
 I have 2 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.590
 Training camp participated in many games 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:35.270
 and many workouts i feel 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.299
 get fit and feel at first 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.220
 Compulsory game adam szalai is next to leon 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.320
 goretzka christian clemens and felipe 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.149
 Santana one of four new entries 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.430
 He was second behind 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.049
 class divider brought the dutchman 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 with actions in preparation though 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.740
 already big competition the ratio 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 between him and the Dutch 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.490
 national striker is good but that is one 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.649
 teammate and we want here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.630
 we only want one thing that that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.119
 schalke for me as much as possible 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.450
 player wins and he and I want 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.369
 we also help and for the team 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.170
 this is a team sport and and that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.450
 is not just a matter of individual sports where you 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.700
 Running each other makes you win 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 we are all in one team 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 that we all the same every one of us 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.850
 play have three points 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.250
 the register's behavior would have this 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.079
 as well as with all other players 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.150
 coach jens keller has with adam szalai 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.370
 the possibility to vary his system 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.230
 either with a striker or with 2 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.660
 then hÃ¼nteler could be our pain 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.799
 Rafting together is the system 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.870
 but not the most important 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.540
 If we are not with a storm partner 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.820
 play front or play alone 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.959
 should or wherever I should play me 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.959
 I'm just not happy 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.609
 place may stand and the market 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.480
 nothing at all as the system is 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.880
 of course , the fans are curious 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.350
 who plays in the storm when cellar with 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.670
 he has to play a striker 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.859
 decide between hinterland and 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.450
 sage even if the hungarian first on 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.489
 sitting at the bank would not be for him 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.060
 problem for him is the team im 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.150
 foreground 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.780
 I also made players in mainz 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 where I where I played I was in 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.340
 bank and and then I have from the bank 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.890
 Come in and I have that of 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.870
 the bank still a bus for the team 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.910
 So just make the money for it 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.400
 a competitive sport we have 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.750
 many games and we want as 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 bring top performance and team 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.710
 we always need the fittest for that 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.780
 players who are ready and 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.190
 the register that fully in places in 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 the last season, many of them 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.700
 width of the cadre a problem the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.560
 players on the bench had too little 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.390
 quality to help the team 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.490
 That could be new with the four 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 problem solved now when it comes to the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.030
 Goals of the new season is looking adam 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 szalai first of all on himself 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.840
 I can only speak for myself what you are 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.070
 are counter and I have often 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.530
 I said that with my quality and 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.260
 help my skills for the team 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.920
 I want so many players how are you? 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 win 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.290
 and yes for what the goals are for 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.270
 schalke you up but one such 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.640
 say who are there for a long time and 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.070
 more familiar than as now, 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.140
 with many goals the hungarian but wants 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.600
 Of course SCHALKE am 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.520
 At the very end, adam szalai stands at the very top 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.390
 could be an important building block for 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.390
 a successful season
