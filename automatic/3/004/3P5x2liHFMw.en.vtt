00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
comfortable I don't know these are the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
comfortable I don't know these are the
lighting<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.710> came<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> large

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
lighting I think it came with the large

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
lighting I think it came with the large
ones<00:00:47.610> already<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.410> kept

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
ones already on there and I just kept

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.100 
ones already on there and I just kept
him<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> thought<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.700> were<00:00:50.820> comfortable

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
him I thought they were comfortable

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
him I thought they were comfortable
didn't<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> any<00:00:52.379> bag<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.100> anything<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
didn't come with any bag or anything for

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
didn't come with any bag or anything for
these<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.780> were<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.170> thrown<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.920> on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
these so these were just thrown in on

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.770 
these so these were just thrown in on
the<00:00:56.160> bottom<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> box<00:00:56.820> probably<00:00:57.300> because

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the bottom of the box probably because

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
the bottom of the box probably because
this<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> sample<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.879> indeed<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.420> know

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this was a sample and indeed you know

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
this was a sample and indeed you know
they're<00:01:00.690> probably<00:01:00.840> still<00:01:01.020> finalizing

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
they're probably still finalizing

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.020 
they're probably still finalizing
