00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.820 
probably letting your old boots go too
long<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:20.939> too<00:00:21.150> soft<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.900> flexy

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
long because they get too soft and flexy

in them they're all wore out and almost

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.779

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
box is get them to flex a little bit you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.090 
box is get them to flex a little bit you
know<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.859> straight

know you don't want to put them straight

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.090 
know you don't want to put them straight
on<00:00:59.660> because<00:01:00.660> they're<00:01:00.899> stiff<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.620> leather<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
on because they're stiff the leather is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.880 
on because they're stiff the leather is
stiff<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.229> your<00:01:04.409> hand

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
stiff so what you do is put your hand

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.560 
stiff so what you do is put your hand
down<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> boot<00:01:06.140> lay<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.650> there

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
down in the boot lay down in there

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
down in the boot lay down in there
then<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> start<00:01:10.470> flexing<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> leather

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
then you just start flexing the leather

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
then you just start flexing the leather
flex<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> leather<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.200> don't<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
flex the leather you don't have to do it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
flex the leather you don't have to do it
too<00:01:14.070> long<00:01:14.250> I'd<00:01:14.549> say<00:01:14.790> maybe<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.810> three<00:01:15.990> hours

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
too long I'd say maybe two three hours

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.969 
too long I'd say maybe two three hours
is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.939> enough<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.979> just

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is going to be a good enough time just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.399 
is going to be a good enough time just
getting<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.340> I'd<00:01:21.119> say<00:01:21.420> maybe<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.350> three

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
getting you I'd say maybe two or three

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
getting you I'd say maybe two or three
minutes<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.340> takes<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.939> flex<00:01:24.420> them

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
minutes is all it takes is flex them

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.890 
minutes is all it takes is flex them
this<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.310> good<00:01:26.520> direction<00:01:26.900> flexes

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this way this is a good direction flexes

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.520 
this way this is a good direction flexes
and<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and then also you can put them down on

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.120 
and then also you can put them down on
the<00:01:31.619> ground

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the ground

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.060 
the ground
and<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.970> back<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.079> way<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.530> them<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> flex

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and go back this way with them to flex

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.999 
and go back this way with them to flex
this<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.549> part<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.320> at<00:01:37.320> least<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> leather

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
this back part so at least that leather

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.969 
this back part so at least that leather
is<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> bend<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.860> know

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
is going to bend with you and you know

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
is going to bend with you and you know
you<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> three<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.000> four

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you just do that for three or four

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.380 
you just do that for three or four
minutes<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.720> each<00:01:42.899> boot<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.270> you're<00:01:45.270> going

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
minutes with each boot and you're going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.789 
minutes with each boot and you're going
to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:46.250> makes<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> big<00:01:47.549> difference

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
to be good to go makes a big difference
