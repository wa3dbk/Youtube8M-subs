00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.109
 Hello everyone today is a little unusual 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.080
 boxing we will unpack 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.120
 Lego minifigure would like to tell you how 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.389
 first encountered data 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 Designer in my childhood in the 90s 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.029
 on sale there were chests of the milky way 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 in which there were also a detail of oleg from 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.369
 which could build a ship 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.460
 I think there was still a plane and something else 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.110
 in general, of those parts could 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 build these constructions on this one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.360
 moment of course all that is left of me 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.780
 from those chests milky way to 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:56.160
 here it is a bunch of parts to build from them 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 something is impossible but in 2013 in my opinion 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.080
 I noticed a video on y Tube 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.979
 pics of dale 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 you probably well known he is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.090
 Lego collector is one of his 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.759
 numerous moves let's say so 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 watching the video it made me so 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.500
 same start collecting different 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.310
 Lego constructors 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:35.549
 At the moment I have 2 sets of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.200
 lord of the rings and 2 sets of turtle 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.720
 mutants are not mendi 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.180
 from nickelodeon i also have 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.119
 excavator or equipment but maybe I 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.299
 show in some other videos in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.960
 principle, the set that they listed 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.820
 everything has pixel matter so in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.750
 in some sense, I copy it here 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.750
 let's unpack the minifigure already 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.310
 so forgetting the quality of the price of this mini 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:29.450
 figures is 99 rubles right here 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.450
 there was a price tag store I took it off in advance 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.700
 I would also like to say that the figures are all 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.079
 According to the film or movie of this series only 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.650
 figures here 16 here of course I would like 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.980
 see inside this sachet 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.810
 any of the main characters here but 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:08.880
 maybe there someone else let's 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:13.290
 let's see already three hurray here 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:21.739
 the main character lego film emmett not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.739
 it seems my name is now I will gather it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.160
 as 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.099
 so it is not clear on this probably should not 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.099
 to be in the hands 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:48.340
 here and this stand under the figure so 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.340
 there was a liner here 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:02.090
 and all the figures are also shown here. 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:06.170
 who are in this series about 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.140
 Oleg film in this case, I came across 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:18.190
 the third figure is the main character 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:22.150
 They are there and u10 and big that there is not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.150
 take a closer look at the figure 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.840
 I do not quite understand what is in his hands 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.539
 maybe it will be clear to those who 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.090
 I watched the movie so far has 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:58.039
 did not watch maybe i will go to the cinema 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:02.419
 and maybe wait until it appears on 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:06.460
 Blurs or 9 disks let's say well 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.460
 that's all for now
