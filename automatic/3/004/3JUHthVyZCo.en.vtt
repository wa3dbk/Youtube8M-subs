00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 a few years ago when you what's the first 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
 BMW generation x6 car predicted 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.890
 hard future pier same thing x 5 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.740
 only more expensive time put everything on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.930
 their places and the second generation 6 i 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.510
 I think it will be even more successful than 1 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.890
 technically like a first time new ik 6 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.200
 almost complete copy 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.970
 x 5 even the platform is the same set 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.310
 engines and all-wheel drive system 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.560
 x-drive but outside 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.930
 a lot of changes in the younger X 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.480
 you can get confused about the big leagues all 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.180
 completely different branded nostrils seems 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.040
 become even more and more aggressive to powerful 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.590
 wheel arches emphasize sports 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.629
 ik-6 character LED optics 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.059
 appeared on the previous ik-6 after 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.400
 restyling but here it became available 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.739
 Immediately before the matrix diodes, the matter is not yet 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.550
 It came but it looks and most importantly shines 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.649
 fine 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.380
 the back has caused a lot of controversy among 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.030
 brand fans but firstly in life 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.899
 she looks better than in the picture 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.800
 Secondly 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.800
 get used to 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.860
 that is, if before and 6 was marketing 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.260
 sweet then it is now real 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.520
 Marmalade you understand that this machine 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.540
 which you sell only by 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.750
 appearance 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.760
 but it's worth it though for iron 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.410
 Changes too many new platform 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.380
 allowed to save in weight 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.320
 40 kilograms and therefore improve the speaker 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.900
 lean view of the IC -6 is not just a version 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.840
 m50d gains a hundred in 5 2 seconds 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.180
 faster than the three-liter treshka 335 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.040
 control system is also available here 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.010
 mechatronic chassis you can choose 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.100
 car character from eco pro comfort 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.910
 and sports to sports plus a limited 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 stabilization systems in our car m50d 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.740
 the last mode is especially justified 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.159
 engine of 3 liters and 3 at the turbine 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.259
 can set the heat 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.299
 and unlike the same Lexus here you 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.519
 immediately feel the difference connect 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.040
 sport instrument panel turns red 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.610
 momentum jumps and the car just 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.870
 waiting for when you push the gas pedal 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.819
 x-drive all-wheel drive is set to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.530
 driver and therefore even in the snow 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.170
 most of the torque on 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.760
 rear wheels of course get out of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.709
 more or less serious drifts can and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.500
 fail 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.900
 feel the live car is without 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.730
 of problems 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.950
 surely it would be untrue if i 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.200
 said that the engineers performed a miracle and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 reconfigured the car in such a way that 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.730
 you feel it as a sports hatchback 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 no such center of gravity really 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.560
 highly felt but for such 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.400
 car class this is probably one of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 top specimens 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.250
 usually sports cars are very 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.379
 tough uncomfortable if you have to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 the road to great distance it can 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.139
 we will have to be a real test 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.269
 drive 300 kilometers i think that 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.730
 nothing terrible will happen and 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.519
 even if you sit back she doesn't 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.290
 feel almost no difference 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.299
 it was a major problem to 6 when 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.100
 height people chose the ceiling but now 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.900
 it is not 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.910
 compared to the previous version 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.580
 the interior has changed noticeably 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.130
 but again, if you compare x5 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.740
 the difference can and not notice the same forms 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.200
 also enveloping lights the same 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.240
 optional digital instrument panel and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430
 exactly the same huge front windshield 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.530
 glass behind which can sometimes hide 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.410
 almost a truck for the rear 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.820
 passengers organized seats more comfortable 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.250
 space above the head is enough profile 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.330
 the chairs became relief not even mean 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.550
 the passenger still has nothing to do there 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.260
 sport and luxury meet 10 in one and 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.270
 same moment on the one hand you have 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.370
 fully electric adjustable 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.820
 chairs where you can pump side 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.140
 support and control buttons for example 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.610
 head restraint and the other side 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.980
 beautiful sporty character 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.540
 car you don't feel like you 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.420
 sit in a big crossover 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.280
 and look far ahead landing 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 quite low on everything around 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.920
 only reminds you that you are going to 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.920
 bmw 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.330
 there are four motors to choose from and even 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.090
 the weakest of them is a 3 liter diesel engine 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.080
 ik-6 gaining the first hundred faster 7 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.390
 fast seconds well and diesel m50 is 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.890
 whole story 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.350
 the first is the engine debuted at 5 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.840
 series and showed himself just fine 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.520
 3 turbines level the so-called 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.510
 turbo giant power failure on 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.790
 small turns 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.670
 when the exhaust system pressure is too 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.030
 its power 380 is a little one horse 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.120
 strength 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.520
 but more impressive moment 740 neutana 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200
 meters, the more so because there are 6 of them 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.960
 engine boasts small 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.750
 fuel consumption in our shooting mode 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.730
 constant stops overtaking and so on 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.370
 That similar expense is 10 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.480
 liters that is in real life and in 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.640
 greenhouse conditions 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.020
 somewhere on the track it can be reduced 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.020
 up to 7 8 liters 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.090
 as well as its experts are available here 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.530
 new security system 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.330
 for example, a button 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.060
 The central castle finally moved 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.919
 at the door you can choose what exactly 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.410
 turn on the car in the car will 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.880
 warn you of danger 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.430
 collisions will follow the markup 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 and will even manage a little bit 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.350
 by car if you drive off 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.270
 intended trajectory rearview mirror 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.130
 view mounted special camera 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.990
 which can recognize pedestrians and 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.260
 report it a very extreme 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.180
 case the machine itself will brake from 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.740
 cons can only be called price 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.229
 our car is worth more than seven 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.880
 million rubles and this is not the limit 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.940
 we recently rode on the very 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.350
 charged varitik 6th and there price tag 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.210
 may not even fit on 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.820
 a calculator but we'll tell about it 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.470
 several release by and large 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.110
 so it is to feel the difference 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.090
 between ix fifth and sixth practically 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.940
 impossible is it on the other hand a 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.400
 Target might worry someone 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.500
 BMW x6 audience left about this 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.070
 same as the brutal crossover 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.110
 both men and women from 35 to 50 seconds will appreciate 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.949
 great wealth executives 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.260
 state-owned companies 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.360
 successful businessmen and powerful 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.729
 officials we calculated how much 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.889
 will cost the first year of ownership of BMW x6 and 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.560
 that's what happened all mandatory 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.430
 Casco and insurance policy expenses 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.090
 transport tax and technical 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.830
 service 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.840
 we have developed a loss of car value for 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:38.909
 year and fuel consumption for this period and 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.490
 addition 1 million 961 1368 rubles so 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:45.080
 One kilometer is worth 78 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.080
 rubles and 45 kopecks
