 Inexorably closer tour supervised 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.349
 No not in sight 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.169
 OK the charm thinner and thinner 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.749
 what to say that I have a while 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.319
 disagree Peter Fill 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.620
 another impression 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.030
 Marien miss her online 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.729
 Prof Abbott 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.729
 thought 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.550
 MR 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 he 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.020
 gain 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.780
 Maybe not even after-hours has kidney value 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 Men 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.780
 more 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.670
 Brandenburg 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.400
 Scheer 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 only then if Florian Ahlmer 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.530
 and 9 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.440
 and no 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 a completely different tone to Dallas - that takes time in old politics 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.440
 better to another PC only from a central No No No No No under 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 the 66 and the St 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.570
 Robertson has been 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.630
 although the merger off they have the best actors 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.259
 after the two why and rarely were 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.450
 agreed for a long time 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.259
 than ever 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.960
 so far has been under culture in the village became village with 2 0 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.509
 Laura Roos names age and other countries 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.430
 Why 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.100
 and so the story of 2 took over Steam for this run every year 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.779
 therefore would have 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.559
 but he has Aigner 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.419
 there is a happy ending 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.519
 everyone is in custody 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.519
 to 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.770
 in fact

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.839
 relief trains 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.849
 1 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 I always choose 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.689
 in lower persons were not injured 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.249
 the Indians have 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.249
 probably true 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.709
