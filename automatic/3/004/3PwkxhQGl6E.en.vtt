00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:20.840
 I start with the parameters with the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 key number so I press 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.990
 a food meditate fashion then comes 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.660
 a step falls in the workshop where you 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.050
 enter this key number and thus 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.330
 then you can deselect the spindle 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.530
 if you have all these parameters all 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.120
 has voted off that means you have eg at 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 121 there is a 6 in there 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.640
 then you have to pay attention to us 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.580
 Below this software is available 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.160
 overwrite and insert that one 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.710
 necessarily on insert presses 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.340
 semicolon before and just everything 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.590
 behind semicolon stands for the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.440
 machine unattractive and so have 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.210
 I set 1 factory and I think so 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.310
 finally voted out 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 that means I have to break down 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.130
 keep going 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.860
 electricity can be made off as I think 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.800
 filling one ships to the circulation me 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.509
 find filling as a cycle close 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.819
 Downstream then you can be nice with 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.280
 the spindle over the table drives places 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.479
 not including the mother sun and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.759
 to spindle meat nice and so me 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.950
 drive over it with the axle and then 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.830
 drive up on the axis straight 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.830
 and then you can bind knotless 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.110
 103 you do not have to use the forklift 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.580
 and rank so in such narrow gaps around 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.850
 four 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.850
 OK 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.210
 donate once so cops I found at 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.910
 I'll find and imagine myself in the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.759
 rule on the table woman in court 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.730
 and because bock is talking on the timetable 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.150
 to control the mother 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.070
 settle directly as to today at the ob 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.870
 it is a greasy if it is 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.140
 I'm talking an Egyptian bet 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 this directly in protection directly 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.870
 culminate on persuading for connection 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.010
 and then I can finally do everything 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.800
 have prepared as expected 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.050
 connected and I see my parameters 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 are all deselected and if turntable 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.280
 I can do it with the axis 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.810
 or if the machines 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 Answer has the z-axis about the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.239
 Dizziness phase and nice and slow 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:58.209
 shopping and then I always have to 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.709
 conclusion is more so small heap 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 I then made the lockers 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.350
 approaches and then at 3 so I drive 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.900
 not complete with az axle to bottom 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.180
 on pressure but I still leave 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.180
 a centimeter and draw the bad luck
