00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Canon's powershot g will continue 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 continued the successor of g1 xg 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.680
 15 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.389
 and she continues to specialize 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.389
 especially on shots in low light 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.619
 probably the biggest external change of 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.570
 the g- 1x ca 15 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.869
 the most noticeable immediately 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.910
 is that the g15 is not a swiveling 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.380
 display has been the display here too 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.189
 not enlarged or so has no 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.930
 touchscreen 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.820
 it still measures 3 inches and fires 320 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.309
 Picture points on it then comes one more 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.680
 optical viewfinder which in the game 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.420
 Six is ​​pretty small 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 not now as it is with the g15 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.860
 if it was enlarged because yes 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 many complained that one of the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.790
 little bit 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.070
 otherwise many became common again 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.660
 things changed a little bit the most 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.890
 But changes do like me 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.220
 do not think to see 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.700
 there is a 28 on the front 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.920
 mm wide-angle lens and that is necessary 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.379
 I say pretty bright with one 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.229
 blind from 18 to 28 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:14.229
 in comparison times was short at the gfx 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:17.890
 the before a blind from 28 to 58 and 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.680
 In addition, there is a fivefold increase in the g15 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.930
 optical zoom energy 15 is located 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.340
 in addition the so-called hs system of 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.700
 I have not done anything with Canon before 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.090
 heard what the 12 1 megapixel c 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.220
 mos sensor and the digic 5 image processor 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 describes this combination but 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.150
 even in low light extremely low noise 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.340
 promote pictures because up to 12,800 iso 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.619
 video recordings are in full hd with a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.320
 stereo sound recording and optical zoom 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.060
 possible especially improved 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.600
 became the image stabilizer 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.090
 this is called intelligent now so it 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.030
 intelligent image stabilizer so 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.520
 intelligent image stabilizer that should 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.500
 up to seven different blurs 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 could also compensate 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.920
 autofocus and the rows recording 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.990
 improved with pure recordings are now 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.909
 up to ten images per second possible 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.590
 for comfortable adjustment of the camera 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.989
 is still at the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.629
 front of the camera also has a dial 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.989
 in the g15 is a digital 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:24.549
 built-in three-dimensional spirit level 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.360
 and that's not just the g15 photos 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.060
 in jay tech on the but also 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.830
 plus an HDR mode occurs 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.600
 good last was still the automatic 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.310
 so the setting expands 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.290
 automatic mode which now for 58 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.590
 different motives are created and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.810
 this has one more 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.650
 Face recognition and as with already 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.630
 the gfx is also the g15 with many 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 Canon Speedlite compatible and there are 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.709
 also a lot of accessories 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.120
 yes it was once a small 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.370
 video about the b 15 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.920
 I would be interested in what you are to the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.660
 Camera says you will find the innovations 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.520
 Well, the camera would interest you 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.300
 you pick something like that writes in the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.739
 Comments 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.050
 I should have forgotten something 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.160
 or something wrong please 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.620
 also write in the comments 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.910
 and with any questions too 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.900
 either in the comments 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.480
 or in more detail things 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.250
 Write a message to facebook on the left 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.350
