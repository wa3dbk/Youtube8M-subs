 from my house my life in the district 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.770

 the fourth stage of the bottom stream 2 brings 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 as a great innovation the fact of the solution 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.550

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.520
 we are in an already regularized area of ​​the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.960
 point of view that you will have when 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 of the entire infrastructure 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.780
 installed in addition to all equipment 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.330

 it is the first consolidation of the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.930
 city ​​that already exists we are not creating 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.360
 a new urban center is a city that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.700

 collective transportation is an area that 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.619
 established neighborhood and is an area 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200
 already ready regularization 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.599
 then we see decades of the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.130
 people were served only with a lot 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.840
 but lottie did not even exist 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.450
