 the Italian rally championship lands in Sicily for its fourth round 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.460
 seasonal finding after a year of absence to that florio plate that in the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.489
 recent history of the Italian flag was almost always decisive in indicating me 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.110
 the winner 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 this year, however, is not the usual Sicilian classifies nina 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.470
 the race that has been able to adapt to regulatory changes over the years 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.540
 of road races but above all the 100-year florio plate 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.700
 the one that began its history on May 5, 1906 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.080
 all the protagonists of the Italian rally championship are therefore also Sicily 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.040
 with the task of paying tribute with their exploits to the oldest competition of the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.460
 world for this at the start there are all the best favors of the forecast are 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.340
 for the two pilots of the fiat grande punto paolo andreucci and andrea navarra 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 3 difficult race because it is this glacier is very difficult or there are 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 lady gaga monster very insidious at the spa 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.010
 however, running to these parts of me has always liked so 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.900
 I am confident also because our car will stand on the roads like this 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.350
 he did fast 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.210

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.259
 proof that the race really understand how much we vote I tell you I'm confident 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.259
 because I like the race 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.090
 but others start with the intention of fighting for the positions of 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090
 summit 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.400

 tomorrow however the race is a completely different story we see 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:35.519
 though surely expedia is to be at least those of research and then we see 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.719
 the plaque that begins with the usual crowds in the Politeama square 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.259
 a passionate crowd surrounding the crews at the start with his great 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.409
 affection among the many many 2 keys for the great Sicilian race they wrote

 beautiful pages jetix tendonitis to the cart 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.579
 but I would say that 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.629
 the truth is 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.989
 in the narration in the nn m makes friendship too I hahaha 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.129
 rendina donatella 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.659
 evidently 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.469
 but how beautiful the chapel plate florio 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.269
 but the passion 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.759
 but certainly that there was 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.269
 in the past it was enormous 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.479
 and this passion remained intact 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.059
 so even today that 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 the altar that has changed its appearance of the lavar woman 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.719
 but these great emotions are always good and this bike is home to 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.069
 public in the memory of those times that are unforgettable 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.930
 the first stage tells everyone that there is nothing obvious under the sun of 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.909

 in the final phase of the battle art. according to predictions but nothing yet of 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.999
 discounted despite the fact that the advantage of rig can allow tomorrow to 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.029
 andreucci to control the return of the opponents 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.559
 the progress of the race was immediately conditioned by the very wet bottom 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.020
 of the first test he has already given you a first vote in the ranking 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.599

 hi5 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.280
 but the plaque of the centenary in this first stage also gave space to others 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:18.220
 as luca rossetti winner of test 4 with her peugeot 206 super 1006 e 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.219
 as domenico guagliardo winner of the special stage 3 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.169
 paul andreucci in command then with franc cunico in second place with the 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.000

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.840
 we no text 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.919
 just the duel for the second position seems destined to be the 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.939
 leitmotiv of the second stage of the rally 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.399
 a struggle that could also involve andrea indini that after losing 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:56.179
 long time in the highly recovered Sunday opening trial up 

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:57.919
 at the fourth position 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.460
 tire problems and set-up instead of me slowed down the race 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.119
 mitsubishi of totò riolo 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.770
 the deer rider, darling of the Sicilian public after having held a 

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:11.209
 along the third position and then slowly lost ground in the final stages 

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:13.689
 of the race finishing even eighth 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:17.999

 competitors behind the wheel of two-wheel drive cars 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.020
 also in this category the battle is beautiful and open with luca friulano 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.620
 lipsticks on peugeot 206 super 1600 officially from the Italian branch 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.199
