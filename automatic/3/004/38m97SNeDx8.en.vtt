in<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.599> video<00:00:00.870> I'll<00:00:01.560> be<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.860> over<00:00:01.979> the

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
in this video I'll be going over the

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:20.560 
in this video I'll be going over the
slow<00:00:02.610> motion<00:00:02.790> feature<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.510> new<00:00:03.629> Galaxy<00:00:04.290> s5

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.929 

all<00:00:21.570> right<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.730> camera<00:00:23.730> app

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
all right here we are in the camera app

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.140 
all right here we are in the camera app
on<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.779> Galaxy<00:00:25.199> s5<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.000> get<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.089> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
on your Galaxy s5 and get to the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
on your Galaxy s5 and get to the
slow-motion<00:00:27.539> feature<00:00:27.900> basically<00:00:28.619> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.919> go

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
slow-motion feature basically want to go

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.990 
slow-motion feature basically want to go
to<00:00:29.130> settings<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.250> then<00:00:32.250> you'll<00:00:32.400> see<00:00:32.669> one

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to settings here and then you'll see one

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
to settings here and then you'll see one
of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> buttons<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.990> recording<00:00:34.440> mode<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
of the buttons here is recording mode so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
of the buttons here is recording mode so
you<00:00:35.130> click<00:00:35.310> on<00:00:35.490> that<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:37.230> gives<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.620> super

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you click on that and it gives you super

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
you click on that and it gives you super

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
lock into your normal limit frame m/s

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.000 
lock into your normal limit frame m/s
which<00:00:40.980> will<00:00:41.250> limit<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> size<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.539> the<00:00:42.600> file

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
which will limit the size of the file

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
which will limit the size of the file

on<00:00:48.780> slow<00:00:48.960> motion<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.760> then<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.030> gives<00:00:51.269> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
on slow motion and then here gives you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.709 
on slow motion and then here gives you
multiple<00:00:51.960> choices<00:00:52.019> about<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> speed<00:00:53.719> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
multiple choices about the speed that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
multiple choices about the speed that
you<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.109> do<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.750> here

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
you want it to do so you look right here

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.410 
you want it to do so you look right here
it's<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.320> 1/2<00:00:58.920> 1/4<00:00:59.370> 1/8<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> choose<00:01:01.530> 1/2

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.530 

and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.350> hit<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> record<00:01:07.710> button<00:01:11.480> what<00:01:12.480> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and then hit the record button what it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.350 
and then hit the record button what it
basically<00:01:12.660> does<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.530> records<00:01:14.370> at<00:01:14.730> twice

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
basically does is it records at twice

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420 
basically does is it records at twice
the<00:01:15.390> normal<00:01:15.810> frame<00:01:16.110> rate<00:01:16.320> normally<00:01:16.830> our

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the normal frame rate normally our

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.320 
the normal frame rate normally our
camera<00:01:17.730> especially<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.390> cell<00:01:18.750> phones<00:01:18.960> will

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
camera especially on cell phones will

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
camera especially on cell phones will
record<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.480> 30<00:01:21.690> frames<00:01:21.930> per<00:01:22.020> second<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.620> if<00:01:23.160> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
record at 30 frames per second so if you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.000 
record at 30 frames per second so if you
go<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> half<00:01:23.790> speed<00:01:24.030> mode<00:01:24.680> your<00:01:25.680> cords

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
go into the half speed mode your cords

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.050 
go into the half speed mode your cords
at<00:01:26.190> 60<00:01:26.550> frames<00:01:26.790> per<00:01:26.880> second<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:28.940> then<00:01:29.940> when

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
at 60 frames per second and then when

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
at 60 frames per second and then when
you<00:01:30.510> play<00:01:30.690> back<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.140> video<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.650> plays<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.280> at

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you play back the video we plays it at

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
you play back the video we plays it at
30<00:01:32.640> frames<00:01:32.790> per<00:01:33.090> second<00:01:33.480> and<00:01:33.660> then<00:01:34.260> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
30 frames per second and then this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.970 
30 frames per second and then this
basically<00:01:35.010> is<00:01:36.000> slow<00:01:36.930> motion<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
basically is slow motion and it

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.380 
basically is slow motion and it
basically<00:01:38.750> slows<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.200> half<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:41.300> have<00:01:42.300> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
basically slows down by half I have to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.730 
basically slows down by half I have to
click<00:01:42.510> on<00:01:42.630> solution<00:01:43.080> again<00:01:43.260> now<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.650> go

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
click on solution again now if you go

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.300 
click on solution again now if you go
down<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> quarter<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:45.510> use<00:01:46.440> it<00:01:46.880> basically

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
down to a quarter and use it basically

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.040 
down to a quarter and use it basically
it<00:01:50.310> cords<00:01:50.580> out<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> framework<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.300> 120<00:01:51.930> frames

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
it cords out a framework of 120 frames

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.350 
it cords out a framework of 120 frames
per<00:01:52.350> second<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.640> play<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:53.910> 30

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
per second so when you play it back 30

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920 
per second so when you play it back 30
it's<00:01:54.660> one-quarter<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> speed<00:01:56.630> now<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.780> all

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it's one-quarter to speed now with all

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.260 
it's one-quarter to speed now with all
these<00:01:59.450> slow<00:02:00.450> motion<00:02:01.310> recording<00:02:02.310> options<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
these slow motion recording options it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660 
these slow motion recording options it
won't<00:02:03.480> record<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.320> 1920<00:02:04.980> by<00:02:05.070> 1080<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
won't record at the 1920 by 1080 it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
won't record at the 1920 by 1080 it
actually<00:02:06.000> scales<00:02:06.300> down<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> record<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.140> 1280

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
actually scales down and record to 1280

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
actually scales down and record to 1280
by<00:02:07.650> 720<00:02:07.980> that's<00:02:08.879> why<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.239> able<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> record

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
by 720 that's why it's able to record

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.479 
by 720 that's why it's able to record
such<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.440> high<00:02:10.560> frame<00:02:10.770> rate<00:02:11.270> now<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> 1/8

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
such a high frame rate now with the 1/8

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.450 
such a high frame rate now with the 1/8
setting<00:02:15.260> slow<00:02:16.260> motion

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460

recording<00:02:19.000> at<00:02:19.090> 120<00:02:19.660> frames<00:02:19.690> per<00:02:19.990> second<00:02:20.500> and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
recording at 120 frames per second and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.050 
recording at 120 frames per second and
1280<00:02:22.210> by<00:02:22.300> 720<00:02:22.630> resolution<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.980> when<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.430> go

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
1280 by 720 resolution but when you go

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.210 
1280 by 720 resolution but when you go
to<00:02:25.090> playback<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> rule<00:02:26.110> play<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.620> back<00:02:26.740> at<00:02:26.890> 15

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to playback a rule play it back at 15

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.130 
to playback a rule play it back at 15
frames<00:02:27.370> per<00:02:27.640> second<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.540> basically<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
frames per second so it's basically the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.010 
frames per second so it's basically the
same<00:02:29.380> as<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> 1/4<00:02:30.340> speed<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.870> it's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
same as the 1/4 speed just that it's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.650 
same as the 1/4 speed just that it's
having<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.500> speed<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.920> actual<00:02:33.250> playback

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
having the speed of actual playback
