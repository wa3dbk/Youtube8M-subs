what we show you can be applied to other

what we show you can be applied to other
tents<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.790> similar<00:00:15.150> style

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.200 

now<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.739> you've<00:00:39.859> chosen<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.460> location<00:00:40.579> for

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
now that you've chosen the location for

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.270 
now that you've chosen the location for
your<00:00:41.269> fly<00:00:41.660> sheet<00:00:41.899> time<00:00:42.530> just<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:42.829> assemble<00:00:43.190> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
your fly sheet time just to assemble the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.430 
your fly sheet time just to assemble the
poles<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.360> made<00:00:44.510> very<00:00:44.809> easy<00:00:45.110> because

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
poles this is made very easy because

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.670 
poles this is made very easy because
each<00:00:45.890> pole<00:00:46.160> has<00:00:46.910> from<00:00:47.420> one<00:00:47.750> end<00:00:47.960> all<00:00:48.409> the<00:00:48.589> way

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
each pole has from one end all the way

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.470 
each pole has from one end all the way
to<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.890> other<00:00:48.949> shot<00:00:49.519> cord<00:00:49.789> running<00:00:50.180> through

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
to the other shot cord running through

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.740 
to the other shot cord running through
them<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.839> keep<00:00:50.960> them<00:00:51.140> together<00:00:55.479> next<00:00:56.479> we<00:00:56.600> take

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
them to keep them together next we take

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.149 
them to keep them together next we take
the<00:00:56.899> poles<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.409> we<00:00:57.559> put<00:00:57.710> them<00:00:57.860> through<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
the poles and we put them through the

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.039 
the poles and we put them through the
poles<00:00:58.370> eaves<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.969> flysheet<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.930> be

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
color-coded poles as this one does and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.529 
color-coded poles as this one does and
that's<00:01:04.220> designed<00:01:04.399> just<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.820> make<00:01:05.030> bear

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
pitching as simple as possible making

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.590 
pitching as simple as possible making
sure<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.520> get<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.759> right<00:01:07.909> one<00:01:08.090> through

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
sure that you get the right one through

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:37.060 
sure that you get the right one through
the<00:01:08.750> right<00:01:08.780> sleeve

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.349 

well<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.399> poles<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:38.909> place<00:01:39.119> through

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
well all your poles are in place through

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.969 
well all your poles are in place through
the<00:01:39.420> poles<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.350> need<00:01:40.469> to<00:01:40.590> peg<00:01:40.799> in

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the poles these we just need to peg in

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
the poles these we just need to peg in
the<00:01:41.219> back<00:01:41.399> corners<00:01:41.880> before<00:01:42.060> reason<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the back corners before reason that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:04:30.030 
the back corners before reason that
pulls<00:01:42.869> up

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.590 

so<00:04:31.040> now<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.220> you've<00:04:31.430> pegged<00:04:31.669> out<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.330> front

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
so now that you've pegged out the front

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.530 
so now that you've pegged out the front
of<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:33.139> tent<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.530> along<00:04:34.340> here<00:04:34.610> we'll<00:04:35.330> just

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
of the tent and along here we'll just

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.650 
of the tent and along here we'll just
take<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.200> inner<00:04:36.320> tent<00:04:36.590> into<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.580> inside<00:04:38.389> and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
take the inner tent into the inside and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:05:26.089 
take the inner tent into the inside and
show<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.020> how<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.410> attach<00:04:39.590> that

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.129 

the<00:05:27.099> final<00:05:27.429> thing<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.729> do<00:05:27.879> is<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.509> secure<00:05:28.839> all

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
the final thing to do is to secure all

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.019 
the final thing to do is to secure all
the<00:05:29.169> pegging<00:05:29.649> points<00:05:29.979> around<00:05:30.129> the<00:05:30.610> side<00:05:30.819> of

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
the pegging points around the side of

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.539 
the pegging points around the side of
the<00:05:31.209> tent<00:05:31.479> then<00:05:32.110> unroll<00:05:32.679> your<00:05:32.860> guylines<00:05:33.069> and

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:33.549 
the tent then unroll your guylines and

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:55.760 
the tent then unroll your guylines and
PEG<00:05:33.939> demo

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.959
