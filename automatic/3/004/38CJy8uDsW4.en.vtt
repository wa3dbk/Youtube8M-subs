00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
using regular weapons I start to use

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
using regular weapons I start to use
snipers<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.310> believe<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> same<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
snipers so I believe the same thing is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
snipers so I believe the same thing is
gonna<00:01:09.270> happen<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.840> game<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.229> black<00:01:10.799> ops<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
gonna happen in this game in black ops I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
gonna happen in this game in black ops I
didn't<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> much<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> beginning

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
didn't like that much in the beginning

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
didn't like that much in the beginning
but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> did<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:13.260> eventually<00:01:13.950> towards<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
but I did more eventually towards the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
but I did more eventually towards the
middle<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> end<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.960> what

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
middle in the end so I think that's what

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
middle in the end so I think that's what
might<00:01:16.439> happen<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.159> game<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.430> might<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
might happen in this game I might I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.080 
might happen in this game I might I
might<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.409> brains<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.460> few

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
might just try my brains out for a few

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
might just try my brains out for a few
weeks<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> few<00:01:21.689> months<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.320> occasionally

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
weeks or a few months and occasionally

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.950 
weeks or a few months and occasionally
snipe<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> still<00:01:24.210> posted<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> sniper

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
game and the main reason I said that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.010 
game and the main reason I said that
then<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:47.580> changed<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.330> opinion<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

auto weapons and all that stuff so it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.520 
auto weapons and all that stuff so it
feels<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.720> have<00:04:46.750> less<00:04:47.080> time<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.320> take

feels like you have less time to take

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.900 
feels like you have less time to take
that<00:04:47.680> shot<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.160> do<00:04:48.340> have<00:04:48.460> less<00:04:48.669> time<00:04:48.850> to

that shot and you do have less time to
take<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.330> shot<00:04:49.540> so<00:04:49.960> it's<00:04:50.050> sort<00:04:50.169> of<00:04:50.320> like

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410

with black ops regular course sniping in
hardcore<00:04:55.419> sniping<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.110> have<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.290> lot<00:04:56.590> less

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
hardcore sniping you have a lot less

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.520 
hardcore sniping you have a lot less

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
regular course night because your damage

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.990 
regular course night because your damage
tolerance<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.810> lot<00:05:02.110> lower<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.190> think<00:05:03.850> it's

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
tolerance is a lot lower so I think it's

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.210 
tolerance is a lot lower so I think it's
very<00:05:04.090> similar<00:05:04.510> between<00:05:05.200> comparing<00:05:05.800> normal

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
very similar between comparing normal

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.640 
very similar between comparing normal

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
amour for three types sniping so it's a

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.510 
amour for three types sniping so it's a
little<00:05:11.290> more<00:05:11.350> difficult<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.919> on<00:05:12.040> certain<00:05:12.370> map

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
little more difficult and on certain map

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.700 
little more difficult and on certain map
sniping<00:05:12.970> is<00:05:13.090> pretty<00:05:13.780> much<00:05:13.960> impossible<00:05:14.169> on

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
sniping is pretty much impossible on

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.560 
sniping is pretty much impossible on
those<00:05:14.830> really<00:05:15.100> close<00:05:15.310> maps<00:05:15.580> with<00:05:16.120> pretty<00:05:16.419> much

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
those really close maps with pretty much

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.690 
those really close maps with pretty much
only<00:05:16.960> corners<00:05:17.620> only<00:05:17.950> tight<00:05:18.160> corners<00:05:18.520> which

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
only corners only tight corners which

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.030 
only corners only tight corners which
submachine<00:05:19.570> guns<00:05:19.750> dominate<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.440> does<00:05:20.890> not

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
submachine guns dominate it does not

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.580 
submachine guns dominate it does not
make<00:05:21.430> any<00:05:21.580> sense<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.300> snipe<00:05:22.630> at<00:05:22.840> all<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.560> i

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
make any sense to snipe at all so i

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.680 
make any sense to snipe at all so i
think<00:05:23.710> when<00:05:24.370> i<00:05:24.400> get<00:05:24.639> certain<00:05:25.030> maps<00:05:25.180> i<00:05:25.479> will

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
think when i get certain maps i will

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.290 
think when i get certain maps i will
only<00:05:25.960> only<00:05:26.560> use<00:05:27.220> an<00:05:27.520> assault<00:05:27.910> rifle<00:05:27.970> or

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
only only use an assault rifle or

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.430 
only only use an assault rifle or
submachine<00:05:28.780> gun<00:05:28.900> just<00:05:29.110> because<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:29.410> makes

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
submachine gun just because it makes

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.620 
submachine gun just because it makes
absolutely<00:05:30.070> no<00:05:30.160> sense<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:31.090> snipe<00:05:31.390> you're

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
absolutely no sense to snipe you're

that so certain maps i believe sniping

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.310 
that so certain maps i believe sniping
just<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:39.220> not<00:05:39.400> helpful<00:05:39.700> at<00:05:39.880> all<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.720> turn<00:05:41.169> i

just is not helpful at all and in turn i

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.380 
just is not helpful at all and in turn i
