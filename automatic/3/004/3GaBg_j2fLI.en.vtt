00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello youtube friends good after 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.610
 have taken out the tutorial in which we see 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.150
 how to install the latest official version 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.509
 of samsung the 412 final official for the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.790
 samsung galaxy s3 let's see an option 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.320
 that many of you ask me is that as 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.419
 I can install this version if I already 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.980
 I come from a law if I already have the law that 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.630
 for example I have a law that is not 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.300
 the official but good as if it were not 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.420
 because it is based on the official law here 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.550
 ok let's go to system settings we 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 let's go here about the device and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.429
 Well, specifically what I have is 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.190
 the omega 33.3 based on the last law 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.949
 official with which we are before the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.500
 same course is how I can do 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.470
 to flash this rom without needing 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.520
 and delete all my data well 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.520
 we turn off the terminal 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.690
 Once the terminal was turned off, we would start 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.930
 in recovery mode the recovery mode is 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.090
 volume up home button and power button 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.460
 I repeat this is to be able to install this 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.920
 version without needing to delete the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.730
 good data if we would do the three wipe is 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 that are necessary that would be wipe cache 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.000
 partition 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.000
 this if we win we confirm 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.150
 if we wanted the white 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.360
 within advanced 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.200
 the white dalvik h 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.200
 we confirm 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 and with this we would have all the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.960
 whites facts we have not done the second 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 which we have done before in the first 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.280
 tutorial that erases everything that would be 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.690
 the white datafactory reset that is the one 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 it erases all the data is worth then 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.930
 if we do not do this wipe we would preserve 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 all data is valid and then now 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.209
 directly we give you to restart the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.120
 terminal and without leaving here we can already 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.850
 press volume down home and power and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.370
 start our terminal in mode 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.769
 download 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 you have fixed I have a kernel if I already 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.530
 I have another different launcher that is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 I have a lot of things that all that in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.819
 theory I will keep it 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 except the kernel of course because 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.040
 that's going to be the one that I install now 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.099
 and the new updates that the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.959
 is going to change worth it is about preserving 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.299
 the data then I connect the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.420
 good terminal press volume up 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.209
 now we are in download mode 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.769
 we connect the terminal to the pc and now 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.150
 comes when we have to install from 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.040
 or dyn 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 Well I selected in my pc 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.959
 the folder where I have the odin 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 lets go see it 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.349
 well here I have the odin 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.170
 I open godin in the same way as in the 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.600
 previous tutorial 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.410
 I'm going to the pda box 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.480
 and selected the find first 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.090
 work that is the file that we had 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.350
 commented before and 9.300 xxl kc this 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.120
 we are going to open it and directly with the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.370
 boxes as I have them here with 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.350
 this activated to know that we have it 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.620
 well connected to the pc exactly the same 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.720
 than the tutorial from before but 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.720
 without cleaning data and we give start 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.670
 at the moment that I will be 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 we also see in our terminal how 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.849
 is moving a line here good now 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.520
 right away it will come out just like we are going to 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.010
 go see here on screen 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.890
 because we are considering the new 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.080
 firmware is the new version 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.470
 but I repeat we have not done a cleaning 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.180
 complete of data with which 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.980
 what we are going to do is flash the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.750
 new version but keeping all 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.200
 our data is to say the account of 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.109
 google the apps that we have installed 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.120
 etc 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.550
 if you ask yourself what is better than 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.199
 do it with all the cool or without all 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.759
 the waves, of course, I will always tell you 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.139
 that with all the cool is much better 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.330
 because the installation is 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.370
 completely clean 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.199
 but well I also miss it many 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.360
 like that and he has not given me any 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.800
 problem so that already left him a little 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960
 at your discretion 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.599
 another option is to try first in this 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.430
 option and if this option did not give us a 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.229
 failure never gives us the freezing there 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.620
 there are applications that do not work 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.600
 etcetera then then we already went to the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.130
 option to access all the waves 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.950
 well we already see it on screen that 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.840
 This new version of 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.360
 Audouin tells us how much time we have left 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.330
 of flash eo good here we see it 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.979
 pÃ¡ramo submitted the video and as I say 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.979
 always gives you time to have a coffee 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.000
 good as we see just finished and 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.430
 our terminal 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.430
 it resets exactly as before 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.660
 you have to put on screen here 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.740
 up pass and in our terminal we see 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.740
 that restarts itself 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.880
 Well then we can 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.720
 move directly to where we have 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.720
 our terminal 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.419
 and here now we are going to wait for 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.759
 start good as we always do as 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.970
 this first boot takes more time to 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:56.970
 we normally disconnect the cable 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.330
 microusb and we hope a little bit to that 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.330
 I finished 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.550
 Well, it's already finished and 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.940
 Let's see what we find 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.920
 now 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.350
 Well, exactly the same as 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.230
 had I mean I have it exactly 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.060
 just as configured that I had it with the 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.310
 same programs the same applications 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.990
 the same widgets 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.730
 let's see if it retains a thousand programs 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.240
 effectively all these programs do not 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.880
 they come with the officer and I have them 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.010
 well with which I keep all my 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.510
 programs all my settings and I've 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.370
 updated to the new version 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.500
 now we would simply root 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.840
 what again to root what can we 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.420
 opt for the same option we have in 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:44.650
 the previous video is to install the 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:49.960
 cf root file from odin chief root sgs 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:53.590
 36.4 and ready indeed we will see the 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.590
 preview of how we would do it 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.120
 turn off turn off the terminal 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.620
 keep pressed volume down button 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.050
 home and power button 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.050
 to start in download mode 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.550
 volume up we connect the terminal 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:23.580
 let's flash 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:26.009
 with odin the new kernel rooted 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.700
 we would give the reset 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:35.529
 and in pda we would place the file 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:38.999
 6.4 we would give you to open start 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.999
 and we have it flashed 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.960
 I have made our terminal reboots and 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.930
 we already have the whole process done 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.490
 well, this would be option b if not 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.350
 you want to lose your data as 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.320
 root the terminal and flash it with the 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.870
 new android version of living 412 

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.520
 samsung official good friends then 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.150
 I hope it has been useful and until 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.150
 the next video
