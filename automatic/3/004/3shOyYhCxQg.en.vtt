the<00:01:51.810> program<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.240> feel

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the program this way is that they feel

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.260 
the program this way is that they feel
transformed<00:01:55.369> they've<00:01:56.369> changed

we<00:01:57.540> spent<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> considerable<00:01:58.590> amount<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.920> time

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
we spent the considerable amount of time

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.420 
we spent the considerable amount of time
sort<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> examining<00:02:00.780> ourselves<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:02.310> are

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

our ethics and values which play an

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
our ethics and values which play an
important<00:02:05.399> role<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.790> how<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:05.969> lean<00:02:06.420> others

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
in this world this program I sort of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.970 
in this world this program I sort of
showed<00:02:15.510> me<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.750> being<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.620> the
