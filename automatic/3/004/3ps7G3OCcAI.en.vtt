anything
try<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.820> see<00:01:51.970> if<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.120> could<00:01:52.180> catch<00:01:52.360> him

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
try to see if I could catch him

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.120 
try to see if I could catch him
off-guard<00:01:52.630> maybe<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:53.230> for<00:01:53.380> her<00:01:53.500> cover<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.950> as

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
off-guard maybe go for her cover and as

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.130 
off-guard maybe go for her cover and as
he<00:01:54.280> goes<00:01:54.430> for<00:01:54.610> Floyd<00:01:54.880> let's<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.870> if<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.020> can

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
he goes for Floyd let's see if I can

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.720 
he goes for Floyd let's see if I can
live<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.830> maybe<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.220> get<00:01:57.430> some<00:01:57.580> extra

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
live that and maybe you get some extra

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.120 
live that and maybe you get some extra
recoil<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.360> then<00:01:58.480> it<00:01:58.660> doesn't<00:01:58.930> work<00:01:59.050> so<00:01:59.650> I<00:01:59.950> go

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
recoil and then it doesn't work so I go

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.370 
recoil and then it doesn't work so I go
into<00:02:00.280> my<00:02:00.700> reunit<00:02:01.300> list<00:02:01.510> now<00:02:01.660> because<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.200> want

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
into my reunit list now because I want

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.810 
into my reunit list now because I want
to<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.530> some<00:02:02.680> damage<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.070> this<00:02:03.250> thing<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.640> I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
to get some damage on this thing and I

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.700 
to get some damage on this thing and I
do<00:02:03.880> have<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.600> good<00:02:04.750> amount<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.050> defensive<00:02:05.500> bulk

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
do have a good amount of defensive bulk

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.310 
do have a good amount of defensive bulk
and<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.550> actually<00:02:06.910> predict<00:02:07.840> them<00:02:07.960> go<00:02:08.110> for

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
and I actually predict them go for

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.050 
and I actually predict them go for
u-turn<00:02:08.680> here<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.100> then<00:02:09.460> predict<00:02:09.729> him<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.940> go

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
u-turn here and then predict him to go

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.910 
u-turn here and then predict him to go
into<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:10.660> screw<00:02:10.869> Kedah<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.500> way<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.680> could

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
into it screw Kedah so that way I could

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.070 
into it screw Kedah so that way I could
have<00:02:12.220> gone<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:12.850> focus<00:02:13.210> but<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.750> needed

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
saying dead so badly and I miss I know

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.600 
saying dead so badly and I miss I know
focus<00:02:19.150> bus<00:02:19.360> says<00:02:19.630> terrible<00:02:20.320> accuracy<00:02:20.920> but

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
focus bus says terrible accuracy but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.580 
focus bus says terrible accuracy but
that<00:02:21.820> was<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> hugest<00:02:23.170> focus

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
how to go for the u-turn um because at

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.110 
how to go for the u-turn um because at
this<00:03:02.950> point<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.280> don't<00:03:03.459> feel<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:03.850> stone

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
now I'm going to go into my Nino keen

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.729 
now I'm going to go into my Nino keen
and<00:03:13.000> what<00:03:13.360> he<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:13.570> does<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.170> he<00:03:14.410> ends<00:03:14.680> up

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
and what he actually does is he ends up

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.490 
and what he actually does is he ends up
point<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:16.150> thunder<00:03:16.660> wave<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.930> believe<00:03:17.230> and

more<00:05:07.970> useful<00:05:08.540> than<00:05:08.660> using<00:05:08.990> earth<00:05:09.410> power

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
more useful than using earth power

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.330 
more useful than using earth power
especially<00:05:10.910> if<00:05:11.090> he<00:05:11.180> were<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.330> great<00:05:11.510> time<00:05:11.750> flame

this thing his band ever scarf and this
entire<00:06:12.150> battle<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.599> never<00:06:12.840> find<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.259> out<00:06:13.380> I

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
entire battle I never find it out I

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.830 
entire battle I never find it out I
never<00:06:13.860> figure<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.310> out<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.460> could<00:06:14.880> calculus<00:06:15.509> a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
never figure it out I could calculus a

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.659 
never figure it out I could calculus a
block<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.319> guess<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:16.889> might<00:06:17.039> do<00:06:17.159> that<00:06:17.190> later<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
block I guess I might do that later I

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.050 
block I guess I might do that later I
think<00:06:18.210> it's<00:06:18.389> banded<00:06:18.780> doe<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.289> I<00:06:20.099> kind<00:06:20.729> of<00:06:20.789> felt

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
think it's banded doe so I kind of felt

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.640 
think it's banded doe so I kind of felt
like<00:06:21.120> though<00:06:21.360> that<00:06:21.690> you<00:06:21.900> know<00:06:21.990> going<00:06:22.319> into

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
like though that you know going into

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.710 
like though that you know going into
drift<00:06:23.099> loom<00:06:23.310> for<00:06:23.520> him<00:06:23.669> was<00:06:23.819> too<00:06:24.030> obvious<00:06:24.240> and<00:06:24.690> I

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
drift loom for him was too obvious and I

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.180 
drift loom for him was too obvious and I
thought<00:06:24.930> you<00:06:25.020> would<00:06:25.139> just<00:06:25.229> let<00:06:25.590> stay<00:06:25.949> in<00:06:26.009> with

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
thought you would just let stay in with

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.600 
thought you would just let stay in with
typical<00:06:26.699> or<00:06:27.289> krookodile<00:06:28.289> that<00:06:28.800> didn't<00:06:29.250> happen

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
typical or krookodile that didn't happen

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.899 
typical or krookodile that didn't happen
unfortunately<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:30.509> I<00:06:31.380> now<00:06:32.099> at<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.550> point<00:06:32.789> to

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
unfortunately and I now at the point to

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.490 
unfortunately and I now at the point to
where<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.120> can<00:06:33.360> only<00:06:33.539> knock<00:06:33.719> out<00:06:33.870> two<00:06:34.050> things

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
where I can only knock out two things

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.409 
where I can only knock out two things

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
so I gonna learn knock out the triplet

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.080 
so I gonna learn knock out the triplet

and<00:06:42.389> like<00:06:43.259> I<00:06:43.380> said<00:06:43.680> maybe<00:06:44.310> he<00:06:44.849> was<00:06:44.969> scarf<00:06:45.240> maybe

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
and like I said maybe he was scarf maybe

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.149 
and like I said maybe he was scarf maybe
this<00:06:45.719> doesn't<00:06:46.050> matter<00:06:46.199> at<00:06:46.380> all<00:06:46.469> but<00:06:46.710> is<00:06:46.979> there

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
this doesn't matter at all but is there

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.499 
this doesn't matter at all but is there
any<00:06:47.280> bright<00:06:47.460> for<00:06:47.669> daily<00:06:47.849> I<00:06:48.030> feel<00:06:48.240> like<00:06:48.360> you

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
any bright for daily I feel like you

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.360 
any bright for daily I feel like you
know<00:06:48.659> he<00:06:49.409> was<00:06:49.560> banded<00:06:50.009> I<00:06:51.680> mean<00:06:52.680> any<00:06:52.889> did<00:06:53.190> have<00:06:53.310> a

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
know he was banded I mean any did have a

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.249 
know he was banded I mean any did have a
toppling<00:06:53.789> which<00:06:53.940> is<00:06:54.090> pretty<00:06:54.300> fast<00:06:54.569> and<00:06:54.810> then

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
toppling which is pretty fast and then

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.709 
toppling which is pretty fast and then
also<00:06:55.469> I<00:06:55.650> guess<00:06:56.099> like<00:06:56.520> I<00:06:56.639> said<00:06:56.880> if<00:06:57.270> I<00:06:57.419> cut<00:06:57.599> the

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
also I guess like I said if I cut the

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.379 
also I guess like I said if I cut the
extra<00:06:57.960> regenerate<00:06:58.860> or<00:06:59.009> HP<00:06:59.550> I<00:06:59.789> could've<00:07:00.300> gone

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
extra regenerate or HP I could've gone

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.059 
extra regenerate or HP I could've gone
God<00:07:00.750> for<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:00.990> high<00:07:01.169> jump<00:07:01.469> kick<00:07:01.500> whether<00:07:01.860> or<00:07:01.979> not

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
God for a high jump kick whether or not

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:03.379 
God for a high jump kick whether or not
I<00:07:02.130> thought<00:07:02.370> he's<00:07:02.550> gonna<00:07:02.669> go<00:07:02.849> in<00:07:02.940> a<00:07:03.000> drift<00:07:03.210> limb

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
I thought he's gonna go in a drift limb

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.290 
I thought he's gonna go in a drift limb
or<00:07:03.539> not<00:07:03.690> because<00:07:04.139> it<00:07:04.259> would<00:07:04.349> have<00:07:04.409> been<00:07:04.469> safe

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
or not because it would have been safe

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.450 
or not because it would have been safe
it<00:07:06.300> would<00:07:06.509> have<00:07:06.630> been<00:07:06.750> no<00:07:06.960> issue<00:07:07.259> there

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
it would have been no issue there

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.980 
it would have been no issue there
because<00:07:08.460> then<00:07:08.880> after<00:07:09.210> all<00:07:09.240> that<00:07:09.449> I<00:07:09.630> could<00:07:09.810> have

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
because then after all that I could have

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.519 
because then after all that I could have
just<00:07:10.139> gone<00:07:10.199> for<00:07:10.500> an<00:07:10.560> HBIC<00:07:11.009> go<00:07:11.250> for<00:07:11.430> u-turn<00:07:12.529> go

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:13.529 
just gone for an HBIC go for u-turn go

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.320 
just gone for an HBIC go for u-turn go
for<00:07:13.740> really<00:07:13.949> whatever<00:07:14.130> and<00:07:14.610> I<00:07:15.060> could<00:07:15.240> have

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
for really whatever and I could have

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.730 
for really whatever and I could have
been<00:07:15.569> able<00:07:15.779> to<00:07:15.960> knock<00:07:16.169> on<00:07:16.319> his<00:07:16.440> crew

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
been able to knock on his crew

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.809 
been able to knock on his crew
krookodile<00:07:17.460> if<00:07:18.139> if<00:07:19.139> he's<00:07:19.889> not<00:07:20.069> scarfed<00:07:20.520> no<00:07:20.789> I

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
krookodile if if he's not scarfed no I

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.939 
krookodile if if he's not scarfed no I
don't<00:07:21.360> think<00:07:21.599> he<00:07:21.750> was<00:07:21.960> considering<00:07:22.740> how<00:07:22.800> much

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
don't think he was considering how much

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.339 
don't think he was considering how much
damage<00:07:23.310> I<00:07:23.370> did<00:07:23.400> to<00:07:23.550> stay<00:07:23.880> blind<00:07:24.110> so<00:07:25.110> I<00:07:25.139> don't

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
damage I did to stay blind so I don't

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:28.339 
damage I did to stay blind so I don't
know<00:07:26.630> especially<00:07:27.630> since<00:07:27.810> it's<00:07:27.930> an<00:07:28.050> impish

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:28.349 
know especially since it's an impish

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.469 
know especially since it's an impish
stable<00:07:28.710> I<00:07:28.860> don't<00:07:29.039> know<00:07:29.099> really<00:07:29.370> what<00:07:29.819> happened
