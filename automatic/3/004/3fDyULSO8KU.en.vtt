hi<00:00:06.509> rich<00:00:06.839> are<00:00:07.020> here<00:00:07.170> from<00:00:07.290> da<00:00:07.470> Australia

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
hi rich are here from da Australia

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.970 
hi rich are here from da Australia
ganging<00:00:09.840> mother<00:00:10.019> surveys<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.860> little

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
ganging mother surveys can be a little

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.709 
ganging mother surveys can be a little
complex<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.700> get<00:00:11.940> quite<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> few<00:00:12.389> questions

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
complex we get quite a few questions

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
complex we get quite a few questions
about<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.259> best<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> gain<00:00:13.889> rudder<00:00:14.130> servos

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
about the best way to gain rudder servos

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.349 
about the best way to gain rudder servos
and<00:00:16.100> there's<00:00:17.100> quite<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> few<00:00:17.970> different<00:00:18.300> ways

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
and there's quite a few different ways

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.760 
and there's quite a few different ways
that<00:00:18.420> done<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> old<00:00:19.020> system<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.529> hard

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that done it the old system of hard

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.349 
that done it the old system of hard
linking<00:00:20.189> together<00:00:22.039> has<00:00:23.039> been<00:00:23.550> around<00:00:24.180> for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
linking together has been around for

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.519 
linking together has been around for
quite<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.539> long<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.080> problem<00:00:25.380> with

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
quite a long time the problem with

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
quite a long time the problem with
having<00:00:25.650> card<00:00:26.070> linked<00:00:26.400> high-powered<00:00:26.880> servos

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
having card linked high-powered servos

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.540 
having card linked high-powered servos
together<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.900> they<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:28.980> slightly<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
together is they get slightly out of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
together is they get slightly out of
balance<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.119> will<00:00:30.359> burn<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.840> quite

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
balance you will burn them out quite

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.030 
balance you will burn them out quite
quickly<00:00:31.230> now<00:00:32.210> swb<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> system<00:00:34.010> which<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
quickly now swb make a system which is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
quickly now swb make a system which is
like<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.280> closed-loop<00:00:35.730> system<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> set<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
like a closed-loop system with a set of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
like a closed-loop system with a set of
pulleys<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.129> I've<00:00:38.489> been<00:00:38.610> using<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
pulleys and I've been using this for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.369 
pulleys and I've been using this for
quite<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> while<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> say<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
quite a while and I'm going to say it's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.479 
quite a while and I'm going to say it's
probably<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> best<00:00:40.950> systems<00:00:41.129> out

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
probably one of the best systems out

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
probably one of the best systems out
there<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.450> thing<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.739> if

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there the thing I do like about it is if

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
there the thing I do like about it is if
you<00:00:43.860> lose<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> servo<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.300> don't<00:00:45.570> lose<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> rest

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you lose a servo you don't lose the rest

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
you lose a servo you don't lose the rest
of<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.559> surveys<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.270> one<00:00:48.270> burns<00:00:48.539> out

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
of your surveys because one burns out

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
of your surveys because one burns out
welds<00:00:49.260> itself<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.250> position<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> other

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
welds itself in one position the other

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
welds itself in one position the other
servos<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.750> fought<00:00:52.170> their<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:53.160> or

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
servos just fought their way around or

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
servos just fought their way around or
trying<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> move<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> servo<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> destroy

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
trying to move that servo and destroy

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.610 
trying to move that servo and destroy
themselves<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:58.020> been<00:00:58.170> affected<00:00:58.530> by

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
themselves and I have been affected by

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
themselves and I have been affected by
this<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.859> didn't<00:00:59.340> lose<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.730> first<00:00:59.850> free

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
there are separate servo arms it works
on<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> pulley<00:01:53.220> system<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.270> get

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
on a pulley system now when you get

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 
on a pulley system now when you get
three<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.840> four<00:01:54.869> servos<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.520> more

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
three or four servos it's a little more

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
three or four servos it's a little more
complex<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.869> pulley<00:01:58.110> systems<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.590> back<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
complex the pulley systems go back and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
complex the pulley systems go back and
forth<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.759> what<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> allows<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.840> happen

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
forth but what this allows to happen

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.590 
forth but what this allows to happen
these<00:02:01.880> servos<00:02:02.880> work<00:02:03.119> together<00:02:03.329> completely

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
these servos work together completely

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600 
these servos work together completely
there's<00:02:06.230> no<00:02:06.380> strain<00:02:06.680> here<00:02:06.920> both<00:02:07.220> these<00:02:07.460> are

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
there's no strain here both these are

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.730 
there's no strain here both these are
pulling<00:02:07.940> equally<00:02:08.240> on<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.390> cable<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.140> you're

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
pulling equally on the cable so you're

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.380 
pulling equally on the cable so you're
getting<00:02:09.979> plenty<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.790> power<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.210> power

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
getting plenty of power the power

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.060 
getting plenty of power the power
doesn't<00:02:11.630> go<00:02:11.780> away<00:02:11.930> same<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.680> would<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
doesn't go away same as it would be in a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.070 
doesn't go away same as it would be in a
hard<00:02:13.250> link<00:02:13.520> system<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.660> happens<00:02:14.960> when

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
hard link system but what happens when

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.460 
hard link system but what happens when
one<00:02:15.290> servo<00:02:15.710> drops<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.990> pulleys<00:02:18.290> come

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
one servo drops out if the pulleys come

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.630 
one servo drops out if the pulleys come
into<00:02:18.650> play<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.100> don't<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.400> full

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
into play now you don't get full

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360 
into play now you don't get full
deflection<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:21.770> get<00:02:21.920> some<00:02:22.160> movement

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
deflection but you do get some movement

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.250 
deflection but you do get some movement
as<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.820> can<00:02:22.940> see<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.480> other<00:02:23.600> survey<00:02:23.960> stopped

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
as you can see the other survey stopped

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.200 
as you can see the other survey stopped
working<00:02:24.650> completely<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.940> could<00:02:26.120> be

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
working completely and that could be

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.980 
working completely and that could be
welded<00:02:26.420> shut

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
welded shut

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.290 
welded shut
over<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.430> as<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.670> see<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.940> get<00:02:29.060> some

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
over here and as you see you get some

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
over here and as you see you get some
deflection<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.350> some<00:02:30.560> control<00:02:30.890> back

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
deflection but you get some control back

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.370 
deflection but you get some control back
you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.120> actually<00:02:32.240> still<00:02:32.600> fly<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.870> airplane

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
you can actually still fly the airplane

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.620 
you can actually still fly the airplane
and<00:02:33.590> there's<00:02:34.130> no<00:02:34.370> pressure<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.270> your<00:02:35.510> other

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
and there's no pressure on your other

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.000 
and there's no pressure on your other
servo<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.290> you're<00:02:36.410> not<00:02:36.500> drawing<00:02:36.710> current

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
servo so you're not drawing current

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.920 
servo so you're not drawing current
you're<00:02:37.820> not<00:02:38.000> welding<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> other<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.810> other

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you're not welding the other the other

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.090 
you're not welding the other the other
servos<00:02:40.060> together<00:02:41.060> everything<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.100> still

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
servos together everything is still

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.160 
servos together everything is still
operational<00:02:43.520> with<00:02:44.360> slightly<00:02:44.630> less<00:02:44.900> movement

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
operational with slightly less movement

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.949 
operational with slightly less movement
so<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:45.890> know<00:02:46.100> something's<00:02:46.520> gone<00:02:46.670> wrong<00:02:46.959> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
so you know something's gone wrong and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.810 
so you know something's gone wrong and
you<00:02:48.110> may<00:02:48.290> have<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.890> case<00:02:49.250> scenario<00:02:49.760> you

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
you may have in this case scenario you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.850 
you may have in this case scenario you
will<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.450> hold<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.780> some<00:02:50.930> rudder<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.680> try

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
will have to hold in some rudder to try

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.199 
will have to hold in some rudder to try
and<00:02:51.950> keep<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> thing<00:02:52.400> straight<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.060> have

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
and keep the thing straight but you have

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.380 
and keep the thing straight but you have
control<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:54.580> have<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.670> plug<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.060> back<00:02:56.240> in

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
control I have to plug this back in

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.360 
control I have to plug this back in
again<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.739> see<00:03:00.920> when<00:03:01.070> they're<00:03:01.220> all

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
again so as you see when they're all

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.430 
again so as you see when they're all
operational<00:03:01.910> together<00:03:02.209> perfect<00:03:03.020> one<00:03:03.290> can

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
operational together perfect one can

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.949 
operational together perfect one can
drop<00:03:03.650> out<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.430> great<00:03:04.640> system<00:03:05.060> had<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.780> had

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
drop out it's a great system had I had

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.870 
drop out it's a great system had I had
this<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.260> my<00:03:06.350> three<00:03:06.590> meter<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:07.100> want<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> save

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
this in my three meter I want to save

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.010 
this in my three meter I want to save
the<00:03:08.030> airplane<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.600> question

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
the airplane for that question

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.880 
the airplane for that question
so<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:10.400> tray<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:11.590> while<00:03:12.590> some<00:03:12.769> people

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
so this tray here while some people

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.850 
so this tray here while some people
think<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> little<00:03:13.340> expensive<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:15.380> if

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
think it's a little expensive I don't if

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.470 
think it's a little expensive I don't if
it<00:03:16.010> could<00:03:16.220> have<00:03:16.310> saved<00:03:16.459> me<00:03:16.580> $5,000<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
it could have saved me $5,000 in the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.520 
it could have saved me $5,000 in the
long<00:03:17.600> term<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:17.989> think<00:03:18.019> there's<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> few

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
long term and I think there's a few

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.590 
long term and I think there's a few
people<00:03:18.830> out<00:03:18.890> there<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.220> same<00:03:19.400> boat<00:03:19.640> when

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
people out there in the same boat when

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.780 
people out there in the same boat when
you<00:03:20.720> gain<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.080> surveys<00:03:21.470> together<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:22.580> is<00:03:22.760> a

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
you gain in surveys together this is a

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.190 
you gain in surveys together this is a
great<00:03:23.030> system<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.600> think<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.870> works<00:03:24.019> really

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
great system I think it works really

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.530 
great system I think it works really
well<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.500> worth<00:03:24.739> considering<00:03:25.420> all<00:03:26.420> right

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
well so worth considering all right

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.520 
well so worth considering all right
here's<00:03:26.690> our<00:03:26.750> three<00:03:26.900> options<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.410> have

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
here's our three options we have

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.009 
here's our three options we have
available<00:03:27.560> they<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.580> single<00:03:28.970> tray<00:03:29.239> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
available they have a single tray the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.550 
available they have a single tray the
dual<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.910> three<00:03:32.360> three<00:03:32.630> by<00:03:32.840> tray<00:03:33.140> now<00:03:33.410> all

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
dual and a three three by tray now all

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.979 
dual and a three three by tray now all
of<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:33.799> when<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.640> buy<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.880> trays<00:03:35.269> they<00:03:35.750> come

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
of this when you buy the trays they come

these from 4 inch on up

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.449 
these from 4 inch on up
we<00:03:54.380> even<00:03:54.500> got<00:03:54.620> three<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:54.920> half<00:03:55.070> inch<00:03:55.310> when

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
we even got three and a half inch when

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.800 
we even got three and a half inch when
you<00:03:55.489> want<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.700> run<00:03:55.790> some<00:03:56.180> pretty<00:03:56.330> small<00:03:56.570> ones

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
you want to run some pretty small ones

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.930 
you want to run some pretty small ones
but<00:03:56.989> basically<00:03:57.890> from<00:03:58.130> three<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.580> half<00:03:58.700> to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
but basically from three and a half to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.800 
but basically from three and a half to
five<00:03:59.299> inch<00:03:59.830> in<00:04:00.830> quarter<00:04:01.430> inch<00:04:01.580> increments<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
five inch in quarter inch increments so

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.180 
five inch in quarter inch increments so
you<00:04:02.900> can<00:04:03.019> vary<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.440> size<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.799> this<00:04:03.860> they<00:04:04.010> also

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you can vary the size of this they also

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.630 
you can vary the size of this they also
come<00:04:04.459> offset<00:04:05.000> as<00:04:05.840> well<00:04:06.110> as<00:04:06.260> straight<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.489> if

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
come offset as well as straight so if

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.430 
come offset as well as straight so if
you<00:04:07.730> want<00:04:07.910> your<00:04:08.030> cable<00:04:08.390> straight<00:04:08.750> run<00:04:09.320> the

the only buzz when I start to put

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.360 
the only buzz when I start to put
pressure<00:04:21.330> on<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.710> move<00:04:22.890> them<00:04:22.980> around<00:04:23.130> a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
pressure on you can move them around a

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.040 
pressure on you can move them around a
fair<00:04:23.520> bit<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:23.880> there<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.510> no<00:04:24.660> pressure<00:04:24.930> on

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
fair bit and there is no pressure on

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.020 
fair bit and there is no pressure on
your<00:04:25.200> servos<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:26.190> takes<00:04:26.490> all<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.730> wear<00:04:26.910> off

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
your servos it takes all the wear off

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.560 
your servos it takes all the wear off
the<00:04:27.150> gear<00:04:27.360> train<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:29.610> essentially<00:04:30.150> it

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the gear train and it essentially it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.990 
the gear train and it essentially it
saves<00:04:31.200> your<00:04:31.290> servos<00:04:31.620> quite<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.860> quite<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.310> good

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
saves your servos quite a quite a good

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.560 
saves your servos quite a quite a good
deal<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.180> punishment<00:04:33.690> as<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.260> said<00:04:34.440> singles
