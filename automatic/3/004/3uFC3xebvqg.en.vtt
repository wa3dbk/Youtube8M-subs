the pasta machine which is about 1/8 of
an<00:00:53.319> inch<00:00:53.609> now<00:00:54.609> my<00:00:54.940> focal<00:00:55.449> bead<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.739> little

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
an inch now my focal bead this little

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.029 
an inch now my focal bead this little
guy<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.059> little<00:00:58.329> bit<00:00:58.600> wider<00:00:58.870> than<00:00:59.229> that<00:00:59.260> so<00:01:00.010> I

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
guy is a little bit wider than that so I

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.759 
guy is a little bit wider than that so I
know<00:01:00.219> that<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:00.579> need<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.149> frame<00:01:01.749> pieces<00:01:02.319> to<00:01:02.530> one

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
know that I need to frame pieces to one

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.770 
know that I need to frame pieces to one
backing<00:01:03.339> piece<00:01:03.579> let<00:01:04.150> me<00:01:04.239> show<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.479> how<00:01:04.659> I'm

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
backing piece let me show you how I'm

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.499 
backing piece let me show you how I'm
gonna<00:01:04.870> do<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:06.250> gonna<00:01:06.520> cut<00:01:06.790> one<00:01:06.820> backing

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
gonna do that I'm gonna cut one backing

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:18.660 
gonna do that I'm gonna cut one backing
piece<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.939> gonna<00:01:16.180> double<00:01:17.340> what's<00:01:18.340> left

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
piece then I'm gonna double what's left

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.209 
piece then I'm gonna double what's left
and<00:01:19.360> cut<00:01:19.780> this<00:01:19.960> two<00:01:20.320> other<00:01:20.530> squares<00:01:20.950> at<00:01:21.159> the

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
and cut this two other squares at the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.620 
and cut this two other squares at the
same<00:01:21.579> time<00:01:21.909> because<00:01:22.750> that's<00:01:22.960> gonna<00:01:23.320> give<00:01:23.619> me<00:01:23.649> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
same time because that's gonna give me a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.319 
same time because that's gonna give me a
smoother<00:01:25.630> edge<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:32.439> how<00:01:32.649> that<00:01:32.890> works<00:01:33.329> pretty

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
smoother edge see how that works pretty

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.490 
smoother edge see how that works pretty
cool<00:01:34.719> nice<00:01:35.710> smooth<00:01:36.219> edge<00:01:36.990> before<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.020> put<00:01:38.350> these

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
cool nice smooth edge before I put these

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.349 
cool nice smooth edge before I put these
together<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:39.250> want<00:01:39.609> to<00:01:39.670> make<00:01:39.789> sure<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:40.210> my

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
together I want to make sure that my

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.200 
together I want to make sure that my
pattern<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:43.240> frame<00:01:43.719> piece<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.579> I've

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
pattern is on my frame piece so I've

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.099 
pattern is on my frame piece so I've
already<00:01:46.390> spritz<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.710> little<00:01:47.890> bit

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
already spritz this just a little bit

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.490 
already spritz this just a little bit
about<00:01:50.109> where<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.409> want<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:51.929> I'm<00:01:52.929> gonna<00:01:53.170> turn<00:01:53.350> it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
about where I want it I'm gonna turn it

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.940 
about where I want it I'm gonna turn it
over<00:01:53.619> I'm<00:01:54.009> even<00:01:54.429> gonna<00:01:54.549> stand<00:01:54.969> up<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.950> put

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
over I'm even gonna stand up and put

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.840 
over I'm even gonna stand up and put
some<00:01:57.100> pressure<00:01:57.189> on<00:01:57.429> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
some pressure on it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.510 
some pressure on it
gosh<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.450> has<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.600> lot<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.899> design<00:01:59.799> on<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.310> now

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
gosh it has a lot of design on that now

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.310 
gosh it has a lot of design on that now
let's<00:02:00.759> see<00:02:00.909> if<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> changed<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> size<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
let's see if it changed the size just a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.289 
let's see if it changed the size just a
little<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.009> I<00:02:06.070> can<00:02:06.219> actually<00:02:06.399> recut<00:02:06.999> it<00:02:07.119> but

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
little so I can actually recut it but

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.390 
little so I can actually recut it but
first

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.780 

I<00:02:11.569> need<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.069> hang<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> this

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I need and I know I'm gonna hang it this

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.190 
I need and I know I'm gonna hang it this
way<00:02:15.890> for<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.069> focal<00:02:17.519> bead<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.269> there<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
way for my focal bead to be in there so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.610 
way for my focal bead to be in there so
I<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> decide<00:02:20.599> which<00:02:21.599> way<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.200> gonna<00:02:22.439> look

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
I want to decide which way is gonna look

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.390 
I want to decide which way is gonna look
best<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.629> so<00:02:27.290> I'm<00:02:28.290> gonna<00:02:28.739> square

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
best and I like that so I'm gonna square

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.679 
best and I like that so I'm gonna square
up<00:02:34.280> save<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.519> too<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.209> make<00:02:36.390> another

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
up save that too you can make another

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:48.910 
up save that too you can make another
bead<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.500> attach<00:02:40.799> these

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.180 

square<00:02:49.920> them<00:02:50.099> up<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> best<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.730> can

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
square them up the best I can

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.530 
square them up the best I can
there's<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.549> pressure<00:02:53.879> on<00:02:54.060> them

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
there's a little bit of pressure on them

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
there's a little bit of pressure on them
not<00:02:55.170> too<00:02:55.349> much<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.739> don't<00:02:55.769> want<00:02:55.889> to<00:02:56.069> take<00:02:56.220> out

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
not too much you don't want to take out

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.670 
not too much you don't want to take out
your<00:02:56.519> stamps<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.049> can<00:02:58.230> go<00:02:58.409> back

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
your stamps and then you can go back
