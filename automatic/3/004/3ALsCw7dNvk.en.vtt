00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so that's the Attic it's pretty much I

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.160 
so that's the Attic it's pretty much I
don't<00:01:22.500> know<00:01:22.560> he's<00:01:22.799> maybe<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> most<00:01:24.180> simple

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
don't know he's maybe the most simple

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
don't know he's maybe the most simple
character<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.070> comes<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.400> moves<00:01:26.610> cuz

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
character when it comes to moves cuz

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
character when it comes to moves cuz
everything<00:01:27.090> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
everything kind of does the same and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
everything kind of does the same and
here<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.009> here's<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> hold

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
here is just as a and here's if I hold

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
here is just as a and here's if I hold
via<00:01:32.729> does<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> believe<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
via does that and I think I believe it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
via does that and I think I believe it
heats<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.130> near<00:01:35.670> target<00:01:35.939> every<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.299> or

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
heats these up near target every time or

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.800 
heats these up near target every time or
close<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> target<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:39.560> up<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.490> kick

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
close to a target and up a little kick

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
close to a target and up a little kick
down<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.369> by<00:01:44.369> charge<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.399> right<00:01:47.399> he<00:01:48.360> lines<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
down a by charge a and right he lines it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.649 
down a by charge a and right he lines it
up<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.140> hit<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.159> charge<00:01:50.659> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
up and then he hit up a charge it's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.730 
up and then he hit up a charge it's
pretty<00:01:51.840> cool<00:01:51.990> down

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
pretty cool down

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.810 
pretty cool down
down<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.909> charge<00:01:55.240> right<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.920> believe

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
down a charge right there and I believe

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.350
