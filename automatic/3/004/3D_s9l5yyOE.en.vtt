00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
very different from the crop out there

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
very different from the crop out there
so<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.809> its<00:00:48.989> own<00:00:49.170> unique<00:00:49.200> look<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.340> like

so it has its own unique look we like

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
so it has its own unique look we like
how<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:51.030> curvy<00:00:51.539> especially<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
how it's very curvy especially in the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
how it's very curvy especially in the
rear<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> could<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> tell<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
rear you could kind of tell how it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
rear you could kind of tell how it
slopes<00:00:53.730> inward<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> around<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> sides

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
slopes inward down and around the sides

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
slopes inward down and around the sides
gives<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> very<00:00:56.430> distinct<00:00:56.969> appeal<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
gives a very distinct appeal to it and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
gives a very distinct appeal to it and
by<00:00:58.260> today's<00:00:58.559> standards<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> still<00:00:59.430> fairly

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
by today's standards is still fairly

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.520 
by today's standards is still fairly
streamline<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> construction<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.170> ok<00:01:01.469> too

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
streamline the construction is ok too

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
streamline the construction is ok too
it's<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.129> plastic<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> chrome
