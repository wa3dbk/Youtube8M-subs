scam on PayPal either so so yeah just
make<00:01:33.630> sure<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> PayPal<00:01:34.470> account

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
make sure you have a PayPal account

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.319 
make sure you have a PayPal account
before<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.250> everything<00:01:35.460> started<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
before you get everything started and it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
before you get everything started and it
also<00:01:36.479> takes<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> few<00:01:37.430> few<00:01:38.430> days<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:38.970> your

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
also takes a few few days to get your

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.640 
also takes a few few days to get your
PayPal<00:01:39.540> set<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
PayPal set up and it's kind of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
PayPal set up and it's kind of
complicated<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.579> should<00:01:41.880> probably<00:01:42.030> watch

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
complicated so you should probably watch

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.819 
complicated so you should probably watch
some<00:01:42.270> tutorials<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.020> YouTube<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> get

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
some tutorials on YouTube on how to get

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
some tutorials on YouTube on how to get
your<00:01:43.890> PayPal<00:01:44.310> set<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:45.689> also<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.140> suggest

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
your PayPal set up now also I suggest

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
your PayPal set up now also I suggest
making<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.490> website<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.540> get

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
making a little website just to get

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
making a little website just to get
everyone<00:01:49.110> information<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
everyone information so you have so you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
everyone information so you have so you
don't<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> explaining<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
don't have to keep on explaining it so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
don't have to keep on explaining it so
for<00:01:52.229> example<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> made<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> free<00:01:53.460> website<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
for example I made a free website to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.780 
for example I made a free website to
forget<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.360> website<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.430> could<00:01:56.610> go

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
forget what website was but you could go

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.959 
forget what website was but you could go

but yeah just search out how to make

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
but yeah just search out how to make
your<00:02:06.149> own<00:02:06.420> website<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.380> free<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
your own website and it's free and it's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.820 
your own website and it's free and it's
just<00:02:08.459> basically<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.849> template<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.530> write

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
just basically a template so you write

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.820 
just basically a template so you write
how<00:02:10.979> much<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.430> price<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:13.319> ex

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
selling your coin stuff like that so you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
selling your coin stuff like that so you
don't<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.270> keep<00:02:18.420> Onix<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.710> over

repeating<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:21.270> people<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.470> that's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
repeating it to people so that that's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.650
