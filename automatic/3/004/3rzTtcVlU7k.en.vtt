00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:12.490
 [Music] 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 teach how to make a trinchan of cabbage and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.290
 potato 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 good for making a trinchan 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.640
 in this case of cabbage and potato 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.380
 following that we are going to need they are going to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 obviously be the potato and the cabbage 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.810
 pepper salt garlic and olive oil 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.200
 extra virgin the process is as follows 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.290
 in our pot we are going to give 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.900
 temperature 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.740
 Lets put 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.740
 salt in the water 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.510
 and we're going to deposit both the potato and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 now like the cabbage the cabbage what 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.750
 we have a match in a very thin julienne 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.620
 and the potato you see is in pieces 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.409
 medium 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.409
 [Music] 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.520
 well let's let this all go 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.200
 knowing until it is very tender 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.930
 for approximately one hour 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 hour and a half and then we went to 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.189
 next step good we have already 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.590
 perfectly cooked cabbage and 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.440
 potato 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.290
 let's put out the fire 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.810
 and we're going to proceed to drain all the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.510
 liquid and stay only with what is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.250
 the potato you see that we already have it super 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.250
 tender and cabbage 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 for this we use a drainer 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 of pasta or any squeegee that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.280
 you have to hand and carefully we turn 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 the content is important that what 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.880
 drain very well and for that we are going to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880
 help 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.590
 of this I will listen to na we will exercise a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.409
 little pressure to make it fall 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.020
 all the liquid 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.640
 ah 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.120
 [Music] 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.320
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.660
 deposit it in this other bowl 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.350
 [Music] 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.900
 and with the help of a fork we are going to 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.890
 work the entire mass 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.980
 disbanding the good 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.120
 until you get an amalgam 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 of potato 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 and cabbage is well well well the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.240
 final 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 [Music] 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.910
 well let's also put a little bit of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.620
 pepper now 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.300
 we are putting white pepper 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.450
 I could arrange fresh black pepper 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.280
 milled a little to taste we have put salt 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.380
 in the mix, however, we're going to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.660
 put one more dot so that it is 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.840
 tasty 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.520
 and we will continue to work for it 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.530
 I take it well and it is divided 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.360
 for the whole mix 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.360
 we are going to make a trinchan 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.400
 classic and quite neutral that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.470
 just now with the garlic sauce 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.260
 you will see that there are recipes in which 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.160
 put sausage or put cartons of 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.780
 bacon a little 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.540
 to likes 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.720
 good the mix and we would have the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.690
 let's reserve aside 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.770
 what are we going to pass 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.770
 to make the sofrito 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.160
 let's heat the casserole in it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.160
 let's pour a good jet 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.800
 a virgin olive oil 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.490
 and rolled garlic 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.220
 [Music] 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.840
 it is important that garlic does not take do not take 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 color simply to a medium fire 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.459
 [Music] 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.730
 go softening and at the same time 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.690
 conferring all its essence and aroma to 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.340
 oil 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.620
 arrived at that point which is where 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.370
 is now 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.630
 let's pour the whole mixture with 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 careful not to splash the 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:13.610
 [Music] 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.610
 let's work it 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.150
 [Music] 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.780
 it seems that there are recipes in which 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.780
 substitute 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.720
 and the oil for lard 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.750
 or is introduced in another type of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.159
 accompaniments beyond the potato and 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.520
 the cabbage or the cabbage as you want 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.520
 call him 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.360
 well let's sautÃ© the mixture well 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.190
 we will be working the same as we have 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.190
 worked with fork with spatula 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.070
 until you have done it 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.060
 perfectly we could also 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.510
 and incorporate a fat or a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.850
 skillet 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.670
 and in turn put all this content 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.420
 give it an omelette shape and it would be 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.160
 exactly like a tortilla 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.650
 potato what happens is that without the use of 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.110
 egg is also interesting that way 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.520
 of presentation to us at the time of 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.810
 present what we are going to do is going to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.790
 be using a hoop 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.980
 as a way 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.980
 of suggestion for you at home 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.720
 Well, let's move on to place here 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.110
 we just take a little bit with the help 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.009
 of the spatula 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.930
 we take to the center of the hoop 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.930
 and we just filled in with another bit 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.650
 then what I said we can 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.260
 accompany with lots of things because 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.460
 he is very grateful and everything goes well 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:57.080
 example some poached eggs above 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.039
 some prawns a little to taste we are going to 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.039
 do some pressure 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.650
 and we just remove the hoop 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.410
 and we would have our trinchan of 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:18.920
 potato and cabbage 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:18.920
