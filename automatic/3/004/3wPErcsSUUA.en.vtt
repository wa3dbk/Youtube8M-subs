 they think they came to earth for a reason

 that their life on this planet is suitable 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 the end and they will be remembered 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 Archimedes cannon on the tesla in fifth place 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.850
 meaning in life leave something after 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.129
 yourself place number five who we are and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 why did we come exactly such questions 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 children and teenagers often ask themselves little 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 who can answer this question but in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 the school in the classroom teachers talk about 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.469
 scientists pioneers great 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 philosophical figures and inventors about 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.460
 whom everyone knows and at that moment for 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 many lives are reopened and who would 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 did not want to in a hundred and two hundred and three hundred 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 years about it would have been written in textbooks 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 stories your biography would pass in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 school and talked about you not loafer and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 bummer and in school years the teacher and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 classmates did not give the young genius 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 prove oneself but in practice 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 invent something come up and leave 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 marks in history can only a few 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.799
 billions and to achieve this you need 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.630
 strive to be the best just to dream about 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.030
 the fact that in honor of you will be called a star 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.159
 planet or even a seedy comet 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 it is impossible yes definitely that everyone 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 human inherent opportunity 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.040
 do something such that only under 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 but unfortunately many of them are brilliant 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.659
 manifestations of people are hidden behind the attempt 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 be like everyone else and say nothing 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 too many discoveries die 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.869
 never born so if you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 believe your meaning of life in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.859
 change history change it 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 [music] 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.060
 people who voted for this item consider 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.369
 that we are all born imperfect 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.770
 and human existence is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.189
 self development self improvement 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.179
 in fourth place oh sorry it is not 4 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.789
 but i'm not quite the place number four 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.620
 become smarter stronger better that way 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.660
 man must behave according to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.000
 people who voted for this item 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.370
 the most important thing is to leave the real goals not 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.239
 be richer than bill gates or smarter than steve 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.870
 Jobs and be smarter than myself yesterday you 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.970
 self-improvement is not always 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.069
 is to become the best 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.200
 enough day by day to raise yourself 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.450
 the bar and no matter what you want to be 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.180
 exercise harder you want to be smarter 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.610
 read richer work but only 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 Every day, schools and universities should not be 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 you nasty if you are a supporter of this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.790
 meaning in life though while learning and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.349
 You can develop and out but any 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.269
 self-development should be prioritized 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.629
 even if a person does not want to develop 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.430
 physically he can develop spiritually 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.569
 mentally and still 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.700
 self-improve so if you 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.220
 think that the meaning of life in self-development 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.700
 in not stand still and train the body 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.159
 brain and soul 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.090
 [music] 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 all rot can go and shoot yourself or 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.560
 don't shoot yourself anyway nothing 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.239
 change meaning in life anyway no 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.459
 third place number 3 and what if we 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 were born quite by accident 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.810
 it is possible that the existence of people 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.180
 it's just a failure in evolution and what 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.040
 our life is not justified we nothing 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.290
 should not do simply because we 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.480
 only pieces of flesh and blood about 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.970
 such a theory adhere nihilists 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.650
 denying any meaning of existence and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.750
 something they are right because the scale 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.430
 the universe no matter what you did we just 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.019
 only small bugs on one of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.269
 billion planets and from that 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.220
 have lived life will not change anything but with 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.900
 the other side why do supporters live 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.569
 lack of meaning in life because all the same 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.849
 do not change anything by the way j described 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.129
 Christian religion as nihilistic 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.349
 cheers how she removes meaning from living 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.870
 on earth and says that there is only meaning 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:06.139
 afterlife well about it in life we 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:07.849
 don't know exactly why cultivation 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.930
 why waste time on empty 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.660
 uninteresting 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.450
 do only what we like it 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.169
 your second place yourself chose a place 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 number 2 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.789
 why do something for others when 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.859
 can rise rational selfishness and 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.110
 spend time enjoying living and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.419
 my life and only for myself so why 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.550
 would not hold as well as you want legs in 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.340
 principle, and this is doing with 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.320
 childhood school no I don't want better games 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.630
 I will play samples, we only what we 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.490
 like all my own love 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.349
 Fun with carefree models 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.990
 travel and many other pleasures 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.880
 in our life just so impossible 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.979
 still have to do something 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.020
 to make money they spend it all 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.030
 time for a loved one but in perfect 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.310
 case work can also deliver 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.990
 the pleasure of such people is really all 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.180
 life flies by in fact not that 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.190
 everyone likes not embodying the meaning of life 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.620
 so if you think you need to live 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.389
 just for yourself don't deny yourself neither 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.180
 what's almost nothing to not 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.770
 then I had to regret it 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.020

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.450
 it is to leave your offspring first place 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.150
 childbirth has always been given a lot 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.340

 understand that not everyone can 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.290
 leave behind something great you can 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.690
 try to give birth to a great son or

 from bad habits to birth in 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.120
 it is also necessary to provide the child 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.100
 should and childhood and education in general and 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.960
 Overall, the right approach to this meaning 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.760
 in life will bear fruit here and 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.860
 the opportunity to live happily in 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.230

 child will be part of you so the choice 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.550
 meaning of life is not so easy but why
