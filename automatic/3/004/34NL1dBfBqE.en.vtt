00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.550
 good to all your kids that jdf 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.129
 I will tell you that he speaks to you live from 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.829
 new york tgcom headquarters 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.539
 no enough then today we are back with 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.060
 this video on the channel the clan 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.939
 today I propose the end of the triology 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.560
 of wine buzzati is not true I propose you 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.239
 the end of the employment trilogy 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.249
 I had to take you on team deathmatch 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.890
 I had already proposed a nice gameplay on 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.350
 of the match on mv 3 on the ghost was missing 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.330
 black ops two so here I am today yes 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.250
 is a nuclear infected only on 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.870
 deathmatches on a 32 minutes and 40 e 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.360
 however it should be one of the most 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.190
 fast in Italy fortunately I was 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.810
 happened a dream lobby and for those who do not 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.100
 He knew what it was a 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.930
 motionless a robbie newsagent whose enemies 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.550
 I'm quite into experts keep to 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.040
 play all and cows from where prudel 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.530
 nose and precisely where they tend to play 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.860
 all dumb thus favoring extermination of 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.110
 mass and precisely massena hascisc a knot 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.030
 of the German just to keep a little one 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.480
 high culture between a little more culture 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.250
 of what you already are then enough for 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.630
 first thing c3 to introduce you the game is the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.640
 classic and in any case I don't remember well 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.970
 why he played a while ago was 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.740
 a n smc quite naked with naked and not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.530
 I mean without clothes for god's sake 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 but without accessories it should be 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.490
 precisely played with a laser sight e 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.409
 enough because I was level 20 so not 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.420
 I didn't even have a jackal and therefore 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.979
 as you can see now I play with a pdv 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.740
 I compensate for the accessories on the ground 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.870
 Obviously I do not know them and nothing the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.280
 rewards was just one for you 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 precisely I did not have or divided for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.549
 in other similar things but I wanted to do 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.290
 a nuclear one the same because it is the 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.470
 main source for which each player 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.260
 extends to play black ops 2 and nothing 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.729
 for how many sets the same comes from 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.350
 supplies the nose that is 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.810
 crying I don't know but I can't 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.340
 defeat the army live so just as 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.390
 you can see from this evening but without 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.830
 creepy the enemies were 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.750
 quite without hands 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700
 I was already tireless so you long 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 pre very hectic fast left e 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.049
 c3 to tell me that I will leave you all 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.790
 because they will be 37 38 gastric then vi 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.950
 I will leave the game until the end e 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.950
 I would like to make a small number of parentheses 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.540
 will say and mag 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.849
 it was done with the bike I could too 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.950
 then deathmatch to the disadvantages e 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.530
 on the one hand there are three advantages 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.530
 fundamental advantages the limit of points 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.099
 time limits and has why boys 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.380
 the point limit is first 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.090
 really 75 really very very low e 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.980
 so you have to do it quickly 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 own objective than in a clermont hoc 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.970
 also both is precisely the second is the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.709
 time which is like all the ten minutes but 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.510
 almost always tends to wear out around 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.099
 to the 34 minutes of the game 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810
 but the principal we say defect of 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.459
 playing deathmatch are the spoke not 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.620
 are marked by a flag or 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.390
 from a bomb then handle enough 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 difficult however you see here I already have 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.959
 taken nuclear really a core 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.970
 very fast, however, I decide not to stop 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.470
 my fury and decide to exterminate the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 poor enemies who didn't know against 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.450
 They stood by playing low is 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.730
 deploying too much precisely that was me 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 saying yes instead we say the only one 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.430
 advantage that you can versu deathmatch 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 that being the first standard mode 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.900
 that in each sps we find ourselves and the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.190
 mode where mass plays a little 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.750
 so it's the mode a little more 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.609
 inflated where people tend to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.200
 play and then many times are found 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.060
 lobby of quite inexperienced enemies 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.889
 as of other and it was this it is not 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.810
 something easy I can assure you though 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.609
 do things about deathmatch 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.940
 let me know what you want to see on rats 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.579
 match if you want nuclear fashions 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.350
 of the cams I would rather prefer to do 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.760
 how nuclear is the game like me 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.910
 like to play black ops on more 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.709
 deathmatch and then ask me koncar ma 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.079
 you want it I already have some bales weapons the 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 Serbian for you ask me things 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.950
 strange on death match especially on 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.989
 cox 2 on the other games too but a little 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 less because on black hawk being 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.549
 just a little more experience 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.200

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.120
