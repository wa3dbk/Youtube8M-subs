00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.880
 the friends welcome in this video today 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.950
 I'll show you how easy it is to avoid 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 that text messages or messages 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.380
 that you receive on your iphone leave 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.119
 on the screen 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.349
 phone when it is 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.129
 blocked or closed as you see now 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.110
 here 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.579
 this can be quite convenient in 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.399
 If you do not want these 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.559
 messages that are so to the 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.140
 seen especially if one leaves the phone 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.360
 supported in a place and anyone 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.940
 what happens and if this is the phone is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.070
 still on can read the cast and the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 full message is a preview but 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.690
 normally as the messages are 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.420
 they always have to be short the truth 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.299
 that reveal many times more than what 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.760
 one wants it to be revealed therefore if 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.450
 they want to deactivate that function everything 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 what they have to do is go where it says 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 james with settings your phone 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.130
 then navigate where it says 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 notifications notifications after 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 this 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 they go down where they say messages 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.540
 messages 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.960
 then they also go down and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.640
 navigate to where it says previous show or 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 to show 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 preview in this if you have everything 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.070
 your 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.880
 and once deactivated they will not receive 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.210
 more those notifications when your 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.580
 phone is blocked to avoid it so it's 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.520
 having your messages more in shape more 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.760
