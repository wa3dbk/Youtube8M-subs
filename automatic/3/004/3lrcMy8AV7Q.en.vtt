00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.310
 has a mission by his group leader 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.050

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.450
 since there is the petition we are 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.350
 in the process of getting signed to us 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.420
 let's remove it 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 he will no longer be president of the group 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.120
 food it is a toys of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.119
 play a double g he plays a double game 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.830
 he just said no he's napping at 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.950
 meanwhile he is tempted to push a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.149
 small group for whoever he is to 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.619
 consultations say that there is another 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.940
 meeting at the presidents his mine of 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.259
 badibanga I think this gel has that 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.160
 seek to participate you will understand 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.290
 that it was the people who had 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.149
 once removed their signature and they 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.380
 have their consciousness charge and we 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.630
 think they raised it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.430
 this to satisfy their masters they 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.680
 will do so at their own behalf but if 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.120
 the president ion must engage with the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.140
 individuals because he's looking for everything 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.650
 price the presence of the peace wolves this 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.390
 even by unorthodox means 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.310
 we denounce this we say they 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 the second vice-president combourg only 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.049
 not the right does not even have the power 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.430
 to engage the group if he did that I 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.350
 know that there are negative pressures 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.159
 around him the points of view 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.409
 divergent 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.869
 while the others find these 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.939
 sitting are a must in the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.770
 train has not yet left the station and 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.290
 I hope that those who hesitate 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.840
 still to be day join us 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.430
 so that together we can 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.070
 to speak because it is that we 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 seek is national cohesion 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.770
 cohesion can not be done in 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.770
 excluding
