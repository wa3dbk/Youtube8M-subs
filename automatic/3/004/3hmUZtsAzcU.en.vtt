00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
pollen tube method of attachment going

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.780 
pollen tube method of attachment going
really<00:01:37.330> easy<00:01:37.689> if<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.890> never<00:01:39.130> use<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.369> type

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
really easy if you never use that type

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.880 
really easy if you never use that type
of<00:01:39.820> attachment<00:01:40.320> basically<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.409> just<00:01:41.439> shove<00:01:41.860> a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
of attachment basically you just shove a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.350 
of attachment basically you just shove a
BB<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.460> end<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> tube<00:01:43.030> sticking

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
BB in the end of the tube sticking

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.550 
BB in the end of the tube sticking
through<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.750> hole<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.229> voila<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:47.200> made<00:01:47.380> out

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
through the hole and voila it's made out

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.440 
through the hole and voila it's made out
of<00:01:47.590> plastic<00:01:48.159> supposed<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.000> be<00:01:49.060> made<00:01:49.240> out<00:01:49.270> of
