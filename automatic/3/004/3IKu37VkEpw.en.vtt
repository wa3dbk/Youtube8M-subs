00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
into it the goalie and that is David the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
into it the goalie and that is David the
higher<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.590> favorite<00:00:43.890> goalies<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
game actually I think he's really good

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
game actually I think he's really good
seems<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.710> overpowered<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.309> does<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
seems really overpowered and does the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
seems really overpowered and does the
any<00:00:47.850> job<00:00:48.180> perfectly<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.899> me<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.320> needs

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
any job perfectly for me he just needs

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160 
any job perfectly for me he just needs
to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> great<00:00:49.950> goalie<00:00:50.449> left-back<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to be a great goalie left-back we have I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
to be a great goalie left-back we have I
think<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> fastest<00:00:53.250> gold<00:00:53.850> left<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
think the fastest gold left back on the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
think the fastest gold left back on the
game<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> best<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
game and one of the best and that is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
at 66 pace and i would actually really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.210 
at 66 pace and i would actually really
recommend<00:02:46.290> sticking<00:02:46.500> him<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> holding

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
recommend sticking him in the holding

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.070 
recommend sticking him in the holding
