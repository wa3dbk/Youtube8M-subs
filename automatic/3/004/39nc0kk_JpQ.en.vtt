00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.929
 greet you dear friends 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.350
 Actually I make this entry for the sake of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.039
 to clarify some things 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 It concerns this video primarily for what 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 fraction we will play the cannibals 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.760
 gates 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 that is, you can go to our group in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.660
 contact and see that with advantage with 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.370
 pretty weighty vote yes for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.340
 what fraction will we go through 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 hannibal dodge won 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.649
 Syracuse in second place is Carthage and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.960
 then with equal votes carries 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.640
 annas and ari vogue 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 but they voted for the smallest 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.379
 the number of people you actually chose 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.940
 Syracuse therefore I will play for 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.040
 Syracuse but I already tried yesterday for 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.440
 play them 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 at the same time I tried the option 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 development 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.280
 unite with Carthage go against 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.910
 straight up 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 and vice versa with Rome to unite and go 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.210
 against Carthage 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 Well, I will say right away that the idea of ​​the very beginning 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 go against right on absolutely 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.440
 non-viable ie before first 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.090
 pores you there chop off and all sicily here 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.360
 but you make all the enemies are dead 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.330
 with you half the cards will fight because 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.940
 what will show are protectorate or with 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.160
 allies of Rome and you yourself with anyone 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 you will not be able to trade therefore quickly 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.460
 go to minus a and then you will come and 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.000
 trample 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.980
 for example , some venety will sail 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 north samnity and other devils by the way 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.550
 saying i looked so rome he 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.130
 pretty passive in general, that is 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.780
 yet I played against him company there is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.429
 not only naval commanders sent on 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 intelligence from you to break me 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.590
 acted strangely the fault you yourself 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.450
 not then you sooner or later all the same 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 their army broke me that's why 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.430
 strategy way way strategy against 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.060
 rima from the very beginning she obviously 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 losing happened so chose 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.880
 the way did not want to do it but had to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.600
 allied in a defensive stream against 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.730
 Carthage go but then it turned out different 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.239
 problem first somewhere around 25 30 moves 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.800
 absolutely boring and tedious came out that is 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.660
 literally in this time here you will 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.860
 really stagnate for the one 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.840
 simple reason that, as it turned out at the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.440
 Carthage on coastal lands are worth 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.150
 not sickly butt in the army from where they are true 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.239
 relocated incomprehensible here but 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.940
 the problem is that if you will 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.610
 to fight with Carthage then the very beginning yes 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.250
 you can only hold one full 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.920
 butt army all aboard you no money 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.440
 will therefore have to be very 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.840
 1 and long try to chop off at least 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 some piece of land plus everything to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.010
 this for some reason in the very beginning in the army 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.700
 Syracuse some diseases any 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.940
 sea on windy start and that is 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.130
 you already parachute and your army 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.310
 on the land of Carthage and at this very moment 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.290
 an epidemic begins and your army 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.450
 faint away right there right down to such 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.849
 figures that there is a half army in a couple of moves 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.410
 You do have to have to disappear 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.300
 go back to your land 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.569
 restore to the troops and only after 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.430
 this go back to carthage in 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.069
 serial equivalent 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.090
 if i would record the episodes myself 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.640
 start then you don't know it at least 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.920
 series 3 or 4 would just take you 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.310
 looked at marking time here and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.730
 all so I decided to do another 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.489
 option 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.729
 we begin and our passage is not the very 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 beginning from the moment I 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 conquered some Carthaginian lands but 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.390
 I certainly understand that you wonder how 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.690
 I did it therefore with such a preface 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.720
 to our main passage that we 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.000
 do I will write well such a movie man 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.789
 we say so that is you know what 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.760
 cinematic camera repaired here 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.930
 so I will try to make such 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.090
 small roleplay 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.110
 and in this intro video for 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.169
 Syracuse explain how I actually 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.100
 began to fight as I captured Carthage I 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.660
 already spider 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.240
 she will actually take a roller and 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.430
 Carthage itself everything will be staged 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.310
 nice but i will try to choose 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.890
 the most comfortable angles here and now with 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.690
 of this place then after all this we 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.700
 you will only start the company for 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.150
 Syracuse because really only 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.729
 later there are 2025 moves at least some 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.910
 action starts and show the very 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.409
 there is no sense of beginning like this 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.749
 Here, dear friends, therefore 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.999
 In connection with this shoot, I will immediately say 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:26.860

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.559
 I will have no time for anything else 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.349
 so I’ll say right away that in about 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.869
