need that you're playing there so you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.499 
need that you're playing there so you
see<00:01:23.990> these<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.350> actual<00:01:26.159> other<00:01:26.820> players<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
see these are all actual other players I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
see these are all actual other players I
don't<00:01:28.229> believe<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.409> actually<00:01:28.710> playing<00:01:29.280> at

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
don't believe that actually playing at

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
don't believe that actually playing at
this<00:01:29.549> second<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.720> happens<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
this second I think what happens is that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.880 
this second I think what happens is that
it's<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> system<00:01:33.869> remembers<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it's just the system remembers and it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
it's just the system remembers and it's
all<00:01:35.070> curating<00:01:35.970> our<00:01:36.090> server<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> all

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
all curating our server and then it all

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749 
all curating our server and then it all
brings<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> together<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.369> play<00:01:38.640> with

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
brings it together so you can play with

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.569 
brings it together so you can play with
other<00:01:39.600> people<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:42.079> as<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> progress

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
other people there as you progress

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.359 
other people there as you progress
things<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.380> little<00:01:46.380> quicker<00:01:46.740> spaces

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
things get a little quicker spaces

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.469 
things get a little quicker spaces
between<00:01:47.869> pieces<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> land<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.409> larger<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
between pieces of land get larger and

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.710 
between pieces of land get larger and
various<00:01:51.479> obstacles<00:01:52.130> appear<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> cool

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
various obstacles appear and the cool

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
various obstacles appear and the cool
thing<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.020> never<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.880> really

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thing is you're never going to really

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
thing is you're never going to really
run<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> same<00:01:57.600> map<00:01:57.899> twice<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.310> happens

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
run the same map twice so what happens

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.649 
run the same map twice so what happens
is<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> um<00:02:00.710> every<00:02:01.710> day<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:02.390> every<00:02:03.390> day<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
is that um every day well every day the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
is that um every day well every day the
maps<00:02:03.869> change

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
maps change

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.399 
maps change
so<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.180> try<00:02:06.509> again<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.110> back<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
so we can try again we can go back to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.290 
so we can try again we can go back to
main<00:02:07.590> menu<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> am<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.880> terms<00:02:09.119> of
