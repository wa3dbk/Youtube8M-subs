00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.350
 new jvm flash 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.150
 today we will talk about the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 playstation conference this is a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 event it's clear yes we're pretty 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.790
 nearly 48 hours of this event and we 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 decided together to make a point this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.100
 we expect from this conference in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
 trying a little to play the prophet 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 prediction operators 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 So here we begin immediately to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 your opinion is what we will have 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 the announcement of a new playstation 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 during this conference yes no doubt 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.929
 categorical category I am 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 completely agree 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.649
 I would like to think so if Wednesday 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 that's not the case but we take our 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.829
 suitcases we go away disappear let's see 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.879
 already milestones as an excuse but I 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.020
 still doubts until there is no 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.879
 a long time now frankly there is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.530
 like africa or presumptions 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.789
 last of the fact that no it's signed 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 present not in any case it's a suicide 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.200
 I think if during this conference 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.719
 he announces us the psp go a new 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.510
 ps vita with a hdmi plug it's like 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 you say the future the biggest 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.149
 communication error of the story 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 which would be studied for years 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.609
 in all the schools to correct I 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.140
 will tell you why I'm going to tell you 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.969
 why I think it will be really 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.359
 a new playstation is not for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.400
 after tomorrow 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.500
 because already I was on loan this all 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 recently and so in the press each 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 it's that in one place and all the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.110
 world is taken convinced and besides sony 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.970
 has in the last days broadcast a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.229
 series of videos on transpectives 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 on the history of the playstation home 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 welcome souls ps2 ps3 so if that's 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 for advanced step and without removing a ps4 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.780
 I think it's weird so here we 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.509
 is all agree new playstation 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 wii then will we see the games wii me 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.869
 I think we will not see much 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 we may see a lot of logo or 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.869
 advertised games I mean how much you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 have all the strongest fans are 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.950
 at the same time they come on stage they go 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 finish with the German guido westerwelle 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.590
 I am without creysse we will see 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.700
 a lot maybe a little demo of a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.159
 game a little bit like the effects on the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.210
 ps3 something to the killzone or the vita 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.850
 it is true that it fell vita me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.610
 general but after names I see it there 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.009
 it'll be okay I'll be okay I'm not 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.350
 agree annoying I think sony has 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.490
 any interest in swinging a real 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 lecture with real game pictures 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.479
 in any case to show that it is not 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.500
 just a project a hull and that there is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.909
 something that turns so I think 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 that they will at least show a real 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.929
 gameplay of a killzone 4 for example 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 a two-minute game sequence 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.680
 really show the performance of the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 console me I heard about 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 already destine us the sony conference and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.610
 I also heard other games like 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.989
 battle creek frames and 4 bat with 4 of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.260
 play of this type there so pay attention to 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.780
 rumors 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.760
 watch out for rumors urban rumors 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.230
 etc and but there will be good with games 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.970
 presented at this conference and for 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.769
 destiny for example it would seem to me 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.540
 coherent since we have byatted to 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.459
 last week I was practically 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.150
 nothing seen in terms of verlaine the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.290
 support for the potters 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.519
 so here and as they do not dare 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.260
 officially communicated on 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.610
 next-gen versions that would seem 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.080
 visual coherence at the rio conference 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.280
 to make games in time yes it is certain 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.790
 but no is that the conference will 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.730
 generous 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.989
 no no no people are definitely going there 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.000
 focus on the machine because 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.049
 that's what the purpose of the conference is to 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.069
 introduce a new machine this 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.569
 that it allows to do etc 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.250
 but to illustrate what it allows to 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.540
 can we possibly have some 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.160
 games and after you have to keep in mind 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.840
 that there is the 3rd we must remove them a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.209
 smile so here you look at them 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.709
 matches hartz iv will be rather of three 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.600
 men we do not like we already spoke I 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.980
 do not know i 'll be at roubaix swimming 5 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.329
 on the batman it's by completing the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.430
 watch the conference in costume 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.209
 so then a brand new controller 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.790
 are we going to have a new 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.380
 dualshock down there too it is precise 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.609
 learns playful on the net that go 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.350
 new models that incorporate a 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.390
 kind of touch surface a little ps 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.859
 vita with also a kind of banners 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.739
 bright the front that will do a little 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.570
 emulation of the ps move but frankly there 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.780
 the go the last lee who are they 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.700
 are still very accurate 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 we see the prototype yeah I think that 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.010
 it will look like that I do not know too much 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.180
 still started walking 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.770
 now we're waiting to see a 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.150
 little really the specifics what that 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.069
 will bring if there are really ideas 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.530
 of design gameplay that can be 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.730
 interesting the adq on saw good it's 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.330
 touch screen we still a little bit of 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.430
 badly again 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.160
 I do not know what they can 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.930
 announce new concepts it's up to 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.520
 developers publishers to use them 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.989
 then it's never guaranteed but 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.670
 the one on the album I have a little soul pop 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.959
 56 of axis what this sum to know you 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.100
 it's going to revolutionize everything then at the end 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.560
 three sets of people even in Tunis 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.280
 allaire that's good I think that the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.620
 black sheets 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.670
 short so so a brand new 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.290
 joystick wii forshaw sony gaikai is this 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.850
 we will see an announcement there is a 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.830
 rumor that would speak of a system of 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.700
 clown that would stream and that's 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:21.799
 ps3 games is that on his ps4 claude 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.880
 baker calabria mengue yes ben me I 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.290
 think that at first it's going 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.120
 to serve that it's actually okay 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.270
 to be able to stream games 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.810
 ps3 be stopover and eventually from here 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.130
 a few years 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.620
 you can also I 'm silent I know 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.180
 4 so yeah that should work he thinks 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.560
 to bet on one side they do not have 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.000
 bought someone for nothing ben we see 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.919
 although they use it at a time or 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.169
 another so that would be the moment 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.930
 after the ag the thing to the press that it's 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.120
 the moment to do it in the future she 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.810
 do not give up but there is 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.500
 possible okay so sony gaikai yes 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.360
 or not but maybe you come back up 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.860
 then the specs are we going to have 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.419
 in hand in detail since then difficult to 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.520
 chosen nantes and syfy the theses of the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.890
 console I do not think about my club because 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.380
 that there is a whip post plus a 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.090
 time the lgt first account of the ngp 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.400
 in february in japan 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.690
 we saw the live specs we will have 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.160
 maybe one evolved to a demo 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.320
 technique you know story to show this 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.540
 that the sphere to the max 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.490

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.770
 silver channel falling but I do not see

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.020
 for the end of saint-therese people 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.190
 so the next 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:32.810
 the next question we will put everything 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:35.780
 everyone agree so the price is 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.180
 no, but I think it seems to me 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.199
 complicated to give up after all is there 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.530
 the guys they announce they are 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:47.229
