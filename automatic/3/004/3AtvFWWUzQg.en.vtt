00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.520
 and then surf club guys my name is 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.020
 Adriana Ferreira and I'm going to be with 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.880
 how do you play the full version of 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.750
 music one brazilian of the paralamas of the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.369
 success 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.970
 the introduction of the song has seven 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:33.040
 chords the greater 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:40.920
 my greatest combat only the dreaded ones have 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 smallest sharp 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 the highest drop in C sharp 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 This smallest in Brazil the same pace 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.080
 Throughout the music I'm going to play well. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.080
 slowly and in the sequence explain how it does 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:24.630
 we will focus once down and on 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.590
 then unscrew the chord by hand 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 left 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.050
 that is we will only support the way 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 of the accord on the balls to power 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:41.220
 mute touches and loosens the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 We played a lot above one 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.679
 down and another up with the ropes 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.679
 loosened following 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.759
 in this song to make it easier for a 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.899
 speak bigger today 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.610
 We're going to use the little pinky fingers. 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:16.500
 the medicine and the index finger to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:20.330
 download the sound that way we'll play 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.080
 once down unscrew the chord 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:31.920
 place your index finger without 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 to play up and down and not 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.569
 Run, we'll use your finger. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.720
 to be able to download the sound 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720
 like this 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.330
 we can make a chord the greatest 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.340
 also bigger eyelashes and we'll touch 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.070
 while the first example I explained 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 does not actually occur would be lower 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.840
 A major makes m higher 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:09.360
 the chords of the first part are the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:15.570
 mayor me greater combat sharp sun does 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.120
 sharp sharp minor C minor is 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:23.610
 bigger 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.980
 if smaller and larger 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:33.830
 said wheels on sun drugs in tone 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.830
 is a way of integrating the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:52.410
 Predecessors of the pre- revolution 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:56.910
 largest slice minute has been smaller 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:02.959
 Have a better fight and I do it 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:09.480
 always the smallest with machine and mon desing 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:12.020
 leave it safe but let it touch that 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.020
 song 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.890
 We're going to play the normal hit down the coast. 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.359
 easily had the lowest with softly 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.730
 we passed easy standards had the smallest 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.520
 with more than thousand of mall and we played 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.590
 seen in this way and in the sequence 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.790
 let's play as down with the curse 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.830
 tight 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:42.150
 one up with a loosened chord 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.150
 on or down with tight rope 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:55.240
 and let's pull back by giving a slide 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:57.150
 touches and pulls and then loosens the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.780
 fingers 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:07.070
 In this way the promotion agreements are 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:14.000
 bigger 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:16.750
 mi major with seventh our having smaller and 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.750
 f. 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:44.270
 ai ai ai ai ai now the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:48.020
 last part is make the dreaded minor if 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:06:14.900
 greater with the seventh in f 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:06:16.670
 minor awareness of these video 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.440
 based on the simple question of the site 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.660
 Any doubt you have is just 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.040
 access this was the point with br 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.040
 the request was worth
