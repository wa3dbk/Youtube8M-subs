00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you'll have to cut it here because

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.350 
you'll have to cut it here because
actually<00:02:20.280> goes<00:02:20.520> inside<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
actually goes inside like that like it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.300 
actually goes inside like that like it
goes<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.349> cut<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> flat<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
goes this and I have to cut it flat so

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.100 
goes this and I have to cut it flat so
it<00:02:26.459> lines<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.780> had<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.959> make<00:02:31.080> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it lines up for this I had to make a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.760 
it lines up for this I had to make a
thread<00:02:32.330> inside<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.480> frame<00:02:33.750> itself<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
thread inside the frame itself and I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.440 
thread inside the frame itself and I
bolted<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.750> pull<00:02:36.750> Sentinel<00:02:37.260> problem

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
bolted it in pull Sentinel problem

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.350 
bolted it in pull Sentinel problem
for<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.750> lower<00:02:40.500> fairing<00:02:41.100> from<00:02:41.519> me<00:02:41.970> I'm

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
for the lower fairing from me I'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
for the lower fairing from me I'm
probably<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:43.260> gonna<00:02:43.470> put<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.010> because<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
probably not gonna put it in because I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
probably not gonna put it in because I
have<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.030> turbo<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.300> yeah<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> bye
