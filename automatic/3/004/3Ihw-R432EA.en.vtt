and II I you know up in his own sue

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
and II I you know up in his own sue
fights<00:00:56.280> Hulk<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.719> would<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.930> been<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
fights Hulk now that would have been the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
fights Hulk now that would have been the
only<00:00:58.289> part<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> movie<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.579> use<00:00:59.879> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
only part of the movie that they use it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.049 
only part of the movie that they use it
in<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.710> haven't<00:01:02.309> explained<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
in so you know haven't explained that

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
in so you know haven't explained that
the<00:01:03.629> angry<00:01:04.110> who<00:01:04.320> gets<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.369> he's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the angry who gets or when he's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
the angry who gets or when he's
possessed<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.030> turns<00:01:06.270> gray<00:01:06.770> doesn't<00:01:07.770> really

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
possessed he turns gray doesn't really

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.340 
possessed he turns gray doesn't really
make<00:01:08.189> sense<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.729> Bruce<00:01:09.420> Banner<00:01:09.750> wasn't

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
make sense because Bruce Banner wasn't

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.960 
make sense because Bruce Banner wasn't
really<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.040> whenever<00:01:11.310> he<00:01:11.610> turned<00:01:11.850> into

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really in there whenever he turned into

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.399 
really in there whenever he turned into
the<00:01:12.150> Hulk<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> whole<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.200> takes

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the Hulk you don't the whole just takes

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
the Hulk you don't the whole just takes
over<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:13.979> primal<00:01:14.460> rage<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.570> they

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
over it was primal rage so then they

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
over it was primal rage so then they
would<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.869> had<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> explain<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.100> know

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
would have had to explain that you know

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.620 
would have had to explain that you know
and<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.909> probably<00:01:18.060> parts<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and there was probably parts of the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
and there was probably parts of the
movie<00:01:18.780> cut<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.950> actually<00:01:20.310> would<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
movie cut out that actually would have

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
movie cut out that actually would have
explained<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.930> hit<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
explained that but they had to hit that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.710 
explained that but they had to hit that
you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.500> quicker<00:01:23.189> time<00:01:23.670> instead<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you know quicker time instead of the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
you know quicker time instead of the
original<00:01:25.080> three-and-a-half<00:01:25.979> hour<00:01:26.189> cut<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
original three-and-a-half hour cut that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
original three-and-a-half hour cut that
Joss<00:01:26.939> Whedon<00:01:27.360> had<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.780> everything<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
Joss Whedon had so everything kind of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.810 
Joss Whedon had so everything kind of
really<00:01:28.799> makes<00:01:29.009> sense<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.610> think

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
really makes sense when you just think

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.270 
really makes sense when you just think
about<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.600> logically<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.619> think

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
about it logically now I think

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
about it logically now I think
personally<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.140> grey

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439

personally I want to like to see grey
Hulk<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.150> cool

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Hulk you know I think it's a very cool

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060 
Hulk you know I think it's a very cool
dog<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> original<00:01:37.770> Hulk

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
dog back to the original Hulk

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830 
dog back to the original Hulk
but<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.340> again<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but then again you know like I say it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
but then again you know like I say it
just<00:01:39.869> would<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.229> been<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.650> confusing

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just would have been a little confusing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670 
just would have been a little confusing
maybe<00:01:42.090> it'll<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.540> alternate<00:01:43.079> cut<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
maybe it'll be an alternate cut you know

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
maybe it'll be an alternate cut you know
that's<00:01:43.920> released<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.399> blu-ray<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.939> something

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that we've heard rumors around maybe

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.889

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
just what if type of thing so you could
see<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:51.060> would<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.240> looked<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.630> but

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
see what he would have looked like but

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.380 
see what he would have looked like but
honestly<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> glad<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:54.149> didn't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
honestly I'm kind of glad they didn't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
honestly I'm kind of glad they didn't
include<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> would

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
include it just because you know I would

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
include it just because you know I would
have<00:01:56.969> taken<00:01:57.149> time<00:01:57.479> away<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.560> what
