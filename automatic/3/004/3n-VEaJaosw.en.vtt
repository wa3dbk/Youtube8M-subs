which I think has probably been one of
the<00:00:59.760> areas<00:01:00.030> where<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.270> games<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:01.140> maybe

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the areas where I games probably maybe

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.380

when<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> started<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> program<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> 17

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
when I started the program I had a 17

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
when I started the program I had a 17
inch<00:01:20.610> standing<00:01:21.000> vertical<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> was

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
inch standing vertical and this was

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.550 
inch standing vertical and this was
after<00:01:22.170> completing<00:01:22.970> p90x3<00:01:24.229> within<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
after completing p90x3 within I think it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.520 
after completing p90x3 within I think it
was<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> first<00:01:25.979> week<00:01:26.250> week-and-a-half<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
was the first week week-and-a-half I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.080 
was the first week week-and-a-half I
gained<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.340> seven<00:01:29.640> inches<00:01:29.790> on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
gained it I think it was seven inches on

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
gained it I think it was seven inches on
the<00:01:30.210> vertical<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.990> touching<00:01:31.350> rim<00:01:31.560> from

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
touch the rim and that was the case
before<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.049> started<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> program<00:02:01.649> too<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
before I started the program too now I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.919 
before I started the program too now I
can<00:02:02.670> grab<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.090> rim<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.659> huge

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
can grab the rim it's huge

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.270 
can grab the rim it's huge
I<00:02:04.960> actually<00:02:05.500> went<00:02:05.740> out<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:05.829> played<00:02:06.130> some

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
I actually went out and played some

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.040 
I actually went out and played some
hoops<00:02:06.490> last<00:02:06.700> night<00:02:06.969> for<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.299> couple<00:02:07.570> hours<00:02:07.659> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
thought my shooting was abysmal

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.530 
thought my shooting was abysmal
I<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:11.500> monster<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> boards<00:02:12.849> felt<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.390> I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I was monster on the boards felt like I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
recommend this program I'm just a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.979 
recommend this program I'm just a
regular<00:02:22.420> guy<00:02:22.599> old<00:02:23.410> guy<00:02:23.709> who<00:02:24.629> just<00:02:25.629> thought<00:02:25.840> it

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
would be really cool if I could develop

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.259

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
I've never dumped in a game but that's

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.710 
I've never dumped in a game but that's
kind<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.160> dream<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.489> mine<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.599> I'm

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
kind of a dream of mine so so I'm

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390 
kind of a dream of mine so so I'm
working<00:02:35.019> towards<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.440> want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.799> 36<00:02:36.280> inch

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
working towards I want to have a 36 inch

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430 
working towards I want to have a 36 inch
vertical<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.120> actually<00:02:37.299> think<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.959> with

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
vertical and I actually think that with

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.050 
vertical and I actually think that with
this<00:02:38.590> program<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.310> could<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.610> healthy<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
this program if I could be healthy and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.339 
this program if I could be healthy and
work<00:02:40.239> through<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> whole<00:02:40.780> thing<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.230> its

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
work through the whole thing and its

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.500 
work through the whole thing and its
entirety<00:02:41.709> for<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> eight<00:02:42.310> weeks<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.730> believe

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
entirety for the eight weeks I believe

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.600 
entirety for the eight weeks I believe
that<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> could<00:02:44.110> achieve<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:44.980> definitely

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that I could achieve that so definitely

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.490 
that I could achieve that so definitely
recommend<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.030> program<00:02:46.209> money<00:02:46.900> value<00:02:47.319> is

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
recommend the program money value is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500 
recommend the program money value is
very<00:02:47.769> high<00:02:47.860> they've<00:02:48.549> got<00:02:48.760> great<00:02:48.970> supports
