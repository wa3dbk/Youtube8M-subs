00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
think well it works with those say close

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.940 
think well it works with those say close
out<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:55.140> close<00:03:55.380> out<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
out of that and then close out that and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.680 
out of that and then close out that and
just<00:03:56.250> close<00:03:56.489> out<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.790> everything<00:03:57.030> else<00:03:57.360> so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
just close out of everything else so

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.949 
just close out of everything else so
that<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.140> got<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.860> clean<00:03:59.160> mind<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.610> then<00:04:00.480> run

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that you got a clean mind and then run

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.960 
that you got a clean mind and then run
minecraft<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.380> running<00:04:04.380> minecraft<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.459> should

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.870 
minecraft so running minecraft it should
what<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.959> now<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.350> with<00:04:07.920> with<00:04:08.370> actually

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
what we do now is we with with actually

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.420 
what we do now is we with with actually
testing<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.660> see<00:04:09.690> if<00:04:10.170> minecraft<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:11.160> going<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
testing to see if minecraft is going to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.240 
testing to see if minecraft is going to
start<00:04:11.730> with<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.209> an<00:04:12.480> with<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.620> mod<00:04:13.829> loaders

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
start with the an with the mod loaders

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.460 
start with the an with the mod loaders
and<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.329> minecraft<00:04:15.840> because<00:04:16.229> you're

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and because if minecraft because you're

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.630 
and because if minecraft because you're
probably<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.859> know<00:04:16.890> you've<00:04:17.160> done<00:04:17.190> something

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
probably you know you've done something

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.420 
probably you know you've done something
wrong<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.959> installing<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.829> those<00:04:20.010> two

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
wrong with the installing of those two

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.630 
wrong with the installing of those two
mods<00:04:20.789> model<00:04:21.419> odors<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.530> that'll<00:04:23.160> work<00:04:23.310> fine

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
mods model odors so that'll work fine

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.730 
mods model odors so that'll work fine
and<00:04:23.849> also<00:04:24.180> another<00:04:24.510> reason<00:04:24.690> why<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.470> did<00:04:25.650> this

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
and also another reason why we did this

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.379 
and also another reason why we did this
is<00:04:25.919> because<00:04:25.950> we're<00:04:26.370> creating<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.880> mod

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
is because we're creating a mod

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.230 
is because we're creating a mod
folder<00:04:27.689> for<00:04:28.319> your<00:04:28.680> class<00:04:29.129> craft<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.879> go<00:04:30.030> into

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
folder for your class craft to go into

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.869 
folder for your class craft to go into
you<00:04:31.139> can<00:04:31.289> quit<00:04:31.499> out<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:32.129> put<00:04:32.819> up

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
you can quit out of that I put up

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.920 
you can quit out of that I put up
minecraft<00:04:33.120> again<00:04:33.599> and<00:04:34.460> then<00:04:35.460> go<00:04:35.729> into<00:04:36.240> your

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
go into creative mode first before I

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.760
