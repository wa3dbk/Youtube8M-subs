00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
but the easiest way I've found to do on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.500 
but the easiest way I've found to do on
location<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> studio<00:00:48.829> mixes<00:00:49.969> is<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.270> use

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
location in the studio mixes is to use

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
location in the studio mixes is to use
effects<00:00:52.110> channel<00:00:52.289> tracks<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
effects channel tracks and then you can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.029 
effects channel tracks and then you can
just<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.640> blend<00:00:54.320> using<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.649> control

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just a blend using your control

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to name a second one a foam two now in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980 
to name a second one a foam two now in
your<00:01:38.340> routing<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.450> sure<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
your routing you want to make sure that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
your routing you want to make sure that
everything<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.700> into<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> appropriate

location so you want all this stuff to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
location so you want all this stuff to
go<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> main<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.950> effects

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
go to the main out and then your effects

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
go to the main out and then your effects
channel<00:01:47.790> tracks<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> assign<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
channel tracks you want to assign the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.899 
channel tracks you want to assign the
routing<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:52.610> two<00:01:53.610> separate

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
routing for these to be two separate

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
routing for these to be two separate
outputs<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> separate<00:01:55.320> headphone

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
outputs so I have a separate headphone

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.690 
outputs so I have a separate headphone
mixer<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:57.240> four<00:01:57.659> input<00:01:58.380> channels<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.460> um

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
mixer with four input channels that um

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.230

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.550 
a couple of your outputs and assign
those<00:02:39.849> outputs<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.510> headphone<00:02:40.930> outs<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.440> then

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
those outputs as headphone outs and then

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.050 
those outputs as headphone outs and then
you<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.829> create<00:02:42.040> two<00:02:42.310> separate<00:02:42.670> headphone

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
you can create two separate headphone

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.479 
you can create two separate headphone
mixes<00:02:43.510> using<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.560> outputs<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.220> your

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
mixes using the outputs on your

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.160 
mixes using the outputs on your
interface<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.480> available<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.019> you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
interface that you have available to you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.250 
interface that you have available to you
okay<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> got<00:02:48.700> two<00:02:48.940> headphone<00:02:49.569> mixes<00:02:49.959> here

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
okay so I got two headphone mixes here

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.259 
okay so I got two headphone mixes here
and<00:02:50.470> then<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> easiest<00:02:51.370> way<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.579> set<00:02:52.000> up<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and then the easiest way to set up the

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.880 
and then the easiest way to set up the
routing<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.900> going<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> mix<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.739> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
routing is it going to mix with you so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610 
routing is it going to mix with you so
you<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.040> hit<00:02:54.220> f3<00:02:54.549> there<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.380> pick<00:02:56.560> up

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you can hit f3 there and you can pick up

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.759 
you can hit f3 there and you can pick up
your<00:02:57.340> mixer<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.239> see<00:02:58.569> here<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.709> two

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
your mixer you can see here my two

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.630 
your mixer you can see here my two
effects<00:03:00.280> channel<00:03:00.489> tracks<00:03:00.910> are<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.930> here<00:03:02.319> is
