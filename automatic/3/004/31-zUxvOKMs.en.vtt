00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.320
 hello girls I'm going to make the dessert of 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.809
 panacotta and for that I need a cream 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.849
 of a liter in this case let's do 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.059
 fed up but if you want to do 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.860
 little quantity with a box of 200 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.929
 ml is to reach for two people 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.460
 I have candy to do what he did to me 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.509
 the one who is for his part the whiskers 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.699
 drain vanilla essence if you 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.720
 they can get the vanilla pod and 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.540
 much better and this gelatin is called 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.750
 with pencil for the mini you are there can 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.210
 see one with one of these with half of 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 one of these that is gourmet 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.150
 reaches for a box of 200 ml if 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.740
 they want to do it with gelatin powder 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.110
 It can also be done but there I do not know 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.310
 the amount they need so 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.940
 they would have to find another video of 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.410
 youtube the blender a fountain and a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.970
 pot because you have to put it with being like that 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:02.230
 and very important sugar this is left 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.460
 and a whole night so that you thicken you're 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.320
 to come so I have to beat the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.300
 before putting the pot on you 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.130
 buy those cream crisis 200ml 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.850
 wait for the live pass to the now 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.060
 let's be all the cream to this and we're going to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.510
 Whipping is simply cream cooked with 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 sugar and it's a traditional dessert of the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.680
 north of Italy 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 so you can see but it 's 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.020
 so I'm going to eat this 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.189
 and then we take this and put it in 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.710
 a pot to sew and they can pour cocoa 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.259
 if they want powder without sugar because 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.750
 this is going to add sugar so that 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.189
 be a chocolate pannacotta to the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.409
 pot we put medium-high heat and what 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.320
 we leave there we are the essence of 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.900
 vanilla 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.729
 so that it takes all the pleasure of the 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.740
 true vanilla and this when it boils what 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.620
 we only left about 30 seconds 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.920
 boil in addition and we stir it from time to time 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.039
 when and while doing this we have 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.350
 that put the fish tail in the water to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.100
 hydrate, we're going to put it in a 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.100
 deep plate 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.120
 and we are going to put in this case that they are 3 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.020
 per liter however as we were 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.480
 I said before 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.620
 there they can break the if you need it if 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.620
 they do not have enough space 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.000
 and we leave them soaking throughout 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 while the cream is going to be in the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.400
 pot with cold water do not forget is 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.800
 only to go take them later they go to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.300
 to stay as well as super-soft 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.530
 but they are not going to be undone only 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.530
 undo something hot 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.050
 the vanilla milk two tablespoons and you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.599
 I was in essence of gourmet 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.790
 you went it does not come out that you like and 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.370
 actually the vanilla is to the taste of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.440
 each one just like the sugar I give him 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.680
 I'm going to cast now let's measure how much 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.150
 they throw him out and we continue a little more 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.810
 vanilla because I found that it was not 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.510
 very much like I had sugar milk 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.510
 approximately a fee and see team 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.510
 this 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.380
 So the gelatin with the water 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.240
 ah 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.630
 you can see there but it's going to start 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.690
 boil so as to be the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.240
 good and let go I have to turn it off 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.970
 as you can see by changing the jewel 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.970
 because I was stuck 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.570
 and this we are seeing all the water 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.519
 and say to each entered 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.519
 and we stir 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.800
 and already the queue to express what 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.960
 we have and revolutionized new lion 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.630
 this must be left in the refrigerator 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.410
 at least one night 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.620
 and a lot came out a lot apart and when 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.900
 he talked about the cream always 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.060
 more quantity comes out and starts to rise like this 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.060
 we leave it there to rest and meanwhile 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.940
 let's do the part of the ornament 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.690
 poquillo good girls here I have the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.820
 small glasses that I will use and each of 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.800
 I'm going to add a teaspoon 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 of sweet in the background, well, here we are 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.210
 we say sweet jams like you 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 want to call you or can you put these 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.389
 sauces that if you put ice cream on 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:56.060
 chocolate and raspberry or caramel 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.590
 meanwhile it is cooling since 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.020
 to put it in the container to be 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.250
 we can not reach and remove it 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.250
 of the heat and put it in the cold 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.190
 now it 's colder 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.190
 let's go to the next 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.780
 there are the desserts and all newly placed 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.330
 you have to make a very big one go 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.150
 because I could not fit more drinks and these 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.790
 they are individual so see you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.700
 and here is the dessert finished good 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.830
 this one released a prisoner mouse but they can 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.680
 to see that it was set there is like 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.540
 consistency of a plan and the one that is the 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.210
 another one that simoes the copy below is the 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.700
 sweet if you want to dismantle this 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.040
 olive dismantle but attacked him before 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.380
 this is put in a fountain with water 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.110
 warm and it is loose there is and they put it 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.750
 located here and they turn it over and there it 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.000
 unmold easily so there it is 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.000
