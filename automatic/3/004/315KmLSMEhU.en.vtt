 hello in today's video we will give you some 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.460
 tips to extend the life of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 our wetsuits we will explain how 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.300
 put it on how to clean them and how 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.160
 save them correctly 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.529
 when we 're going to put on the suit what 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.669
 important is to be calm and take 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.679
 our time 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.109
 It is also important to avoid notching the 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.669
 tissue when we are putting ourselves 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.980
 let's give a very simple advice and 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.380
 economic to avoid them 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.910
 the plastic bags on the feet we 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.570
 they're going to allow the suit to slide 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.570
 easily 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.570
 we must always work from the 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.950
 ankles up and so we 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.120
 we make sure it stays 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 perfectly adjusted 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 we have to rinse the suit with water 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.180
 cold and sweet after each use 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.310
 making sure that all the salt the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 sand and dirt is gone and that the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.540
 Zipper area is totally 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.130
 clean so we will prevent the tissue 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 lose property and it cracks 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.920
 we advise you this cleansing shampoo and 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 conditioner does not contain substances 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.170
 harmful and is totally biodegradable 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.710
 eliminates salt chlorine odors and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.710
 organic waste 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.020
 It is a perfect disinfectant and 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.580
 conditioner to preserve and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.800
 prolong the life of our 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.780
 neoprene to turn around when 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.480
 put to dry and do not expose the suit to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.220
 heat or direct sunlight rays 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.770
 ultraviolet damage the fiber of the suit 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.750
 they take away elasticity they are going to scream 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.670
 to save the costumes we can do it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.890
 in two ways one is hanging those in a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.420
 hanger and another is achieving the silos 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 we post a date is always 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.170
 advisable to make a hanger as 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.960
 thick possible especially in the area of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.560
 shoulders and it is also advisable not to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 leave them hanging more than two weeks 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.030
 another way to keep the non-plenary is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.400
 folding them to do the first thing 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.250
 we should do is turn them over 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.989
 say the inside part leave it out 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.120
 what we are going to do to double them is 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.739
 bend the legs with the knees 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.739
 and bring them to the chest 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.330
 also what we will do with the arms 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.330
 crossed over the chest 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 well with this and the rest of the advice 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.380
 that we have given you because we hope to be 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.770
 able to extend the life of your 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 less
