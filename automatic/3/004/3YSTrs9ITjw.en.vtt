energy I wanted to talk to you about
when<00:00:46.769> to<00:00:47.460> break<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> fast<00:00:49.790> obviously<00:00:50.790> you

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
when to break the fast obviously you

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.119 
when to break the fast obviously you
might<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.690> constraints<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.739> might

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
might have time constraints so you might

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
might have time constraints so you might
want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> set<00:00:54.090> aside<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.420> certain<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:55.200> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
want to set aside a certain time to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.369 
want to set aside a certain time to
water<00:00:55.710> fast<00:00:56.539> but<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.960> encourage

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
water fast but what I would encourage

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.689 
water fast but what I would encourage
you<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:01.140> by<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.399> body

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you to do is to go by what your body

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.279 
you to do is to go by what your body
tells<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:06.080> towards<00:01:07.080> the

and if you're if you happen to be going
through<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.670> detox<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.539> healing

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
through some kind of a detox or healing

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.650 
through some kind of a detox or healing
crisis<00:01:16.850> then<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.780> best<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.679> can<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
crisis then the best thing you can do is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.050 
crisis then the best thing you can do is
actually<00:01:21.660> to<00:01:22.140> continue<00:01:22.679> fasting<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.610> another

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
actually to continue fasting for another

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually to continue fasting for another
day<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:24.840> maybe<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.299> when

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
day or two maybe this is because when

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
day or two maybe this is because when
you're<00:01:28.020> healing<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> most<00:01:30.320> efficient<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you're healing the most efficient way to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
you're healing the most efficient way to
heal<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.860> through<00:01:34.860> fasting<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
heal is through fasting so if you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
heal is through fasting so if you
continue<00:01:38.070> fasting<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.329> through

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
continue fasting you will go through

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.100 
continue fasting you will go through
this<00:01:39.869> much<00:01:40.500> quicker<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.579> better<00:01:42.030> than<00:01:42.900> if

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this much quicker much better than if

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.380 
this much quicker much better than if
you<00:01:43.320> start<00:01:43.890> engaging<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:45.119> digestive<00:01:45.840> system

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
you start engaging your digestive system
