00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
well Road King made a gas tank for this

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.599 
well Road King made a gas tank for this
thing<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.770> looks<00:00:19.770> pretty<00:00:19.859> good<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.490> say

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.220 
so myself I'm like we actually mounted
the<00:00:24.510> base<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> bottom<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> then

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the base to the bottom here and then

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.810 
the base to the bottom here and then
we're<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> make<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> new<00:00:29.099> base<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
we're going to make a new base for it

we're going to make a new base for it
it's<00:00:30.420> lots<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:30.990> work<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:32.059> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
not into these engines you really you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
not into these engines you really you
won't<00:01:32.159> understand<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:32.909> even<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

won't understand it because even if you
do<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.590> engines<00:01:34.979> they're<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> little

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
do have these engines they're a little

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
do have these engines they're a little
difficult<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> understand<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:37.200> ahead

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
difficult to understand but go ahead

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.340 
difficult to understand but go ahead

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
on each lever arm for each ball there'll

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.100 
on each lever arm for each ball there'll
be<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.509> sheetmetal<00:01:48.509> levers

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
be two of these little sheetmetal levers

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
be two of these little sheetmetal levers
and<00:01:49.380> they'll<00:01:50.720> act<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.229> little<00:01:52.890> spindle<00:01:53.310> that

and they'll act on a little spindle that
rides<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> shaft<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> ball

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
rides on the shaft here when the ball

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.260 
rides on the shaft here when the ball
flies<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.240> level<00:01:57.240> pull<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> spindle<00:01:58.229> up

against<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> spring<00:02:00.719> which<00:02:00.930> will<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
against a spring which will be up in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.639 
against a spring which will be up in
here<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.939> that'll<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.649> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
here all right and what that'll do with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.889 
here all right and what that'll do with
that<00:02:04.799> spindle<00:02:05.250> being<00:02:05.460> pulled<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.210> there'll<00:02:06.869> be

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that spindle being pulled up there'll be

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.870 
that spindle being pulled up there'll be
a<00:02:07.049> lever<00:02:07.350> attached<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.039> there

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
a lever attached to there

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.030 
a lever attached to there
and<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.600> lever<00:02:09.870> will<00:02:10.080> also<00:02:10.440> rise<00:02:10.680> with<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
and that lever will also rise with the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.760 
and that lever will also rise with the
spindle<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.820> it'll<00:02:12.780> connect<00:02:13.140> down<00:02:13.350> here<00:02:13.650> with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
spindle and it'll connect down here with

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.970 
spindle and it'll connect down here with
a<00:02:13.800> little<00:02:14.190> 90<00:02:14.640> degree<00:02:14.910> lever<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.650> that'll

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
a little 90 degree lever and that'll

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.780 
a little 90 degree lever and that'll
pull<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:20.000> pin<00:02:21.000> into<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.050> way<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> pin<00:02:23.520> for

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
pull a pin into the way of this pin for

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.000 
pull a pin into the way of this pin for
the<00:02:23.850> exhaust<00:02:24.240> valve<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:24.990> drop<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the exhaust valve which will drop it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.090 
the exhaust valve which will drop it
open<00:02:26.390> while<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> balls<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:27.960> out<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.350> then<00:02:28.530> as

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
open while the balls are out and then as

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.460 
open while the balls are out and then as
they<00:02:29.340> slow<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:30.630> pin<00:02:30.960> will<00:02:31.110> pull<00:02:31.320> away

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
they slow down that pin will pull away

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.980 
they slow down that pin will pull away
and<00:02:32.250> I'll<00:02:32.970> let<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.240> valve<00:02:33.420> closed<00:02:33.690> again

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
and I'll let the valve closed again

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.500 
and I'll let the valve closed again
right<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> purpose<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.490> lever<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
right and the purpose of that lever to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.200 
right and the purpose of that lever to
hold<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> valve<00:02:37.050> open<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> end

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
hold the valve open is to make the end

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.660 
hold the valve open is to make the end
of<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.420> engine<00:02:39.570> will<00:02:39.840> spin<00:02:40.490> from<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
of the engine will spin from the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.210 
of the engine will spin from the
centrifugal<00:02:42.090> force<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> big<00:02:43.980> fly

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
centrifugal force right of the big fly

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
centrifugal force right of the big fly
wheels<00:02:44.630> Mike<00:02:45.630> left<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> flywheels<00:02:46.380> home<00:02:46.650> I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
wheels Mike left the flywheels home I

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.280 
wheels Mike left the flywheels home I
don't<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:47.850> why<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.540> didn't<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.870> room<00:02:49.110> or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
don't know why just didn't have room or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.320 
don't know why just didn't have room or
forgotten<00:02:49.710> or<00:02:49.800> something<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.340> they're<00:02:51.180> all

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
forgotten or something but they're all

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.510 
forgotten or something but they're all
done<00:02:51.710> yeah<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.860> would<00:02:52.950> look<00:02:53.040> good<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.220> there

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
done yeah it would look good on there

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.730 
done yeah it would look good on there
but<00:02:53.960> we<00:02:54.960> don't<00:02:55.110> need<00:02:55.200> them<00:02:55.320> right<00:02:55.410> now<00:02:55.590> for

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
but we don't need them right now for

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.270 
but we don't need them right now for
what<00:02:55.830> we're<00:02:55.950> doing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
what we're doing

we'll<00:02:57.240> go<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.690> machine<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.020> few<00:02:58.170> more<00:02:58.320> parts

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
we'll go get a machine a few more parts

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860 
we'll go get a machine a few more parts
right<00:02:59.090> what<00:03:00.090> were<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.210> in<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> machine<00:03:00.600> today

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
right what were you in a machine today

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.410 
right what were you in a machine today
today<00:03:01.800> I'll<00:03:01.920> make<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> collar<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> little

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
today I'll make the collar with a little

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.260 
today I'll make the collar with a little
spindle<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.080> shaft<00:03:04.350> no<00:03:05.070> leverage<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.910> it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
spindle for the shaft no leverage to it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.940 
spindle for the shaft no leverage to it
and<00:03:06.480> still<00:03:06.750> working<00:03:06.990> on<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> latch<00:03:07.740> out

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and still working on the latch out

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770 
and still working on the latch out
mechanism<00:03:08.520> all<00:03:08.850> right<00:03:09.000> well<00:03:09.390> you're<00:03:09.510> doing

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
mechanism all right well you're doing

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.080 
mechanism all right well you're doing
that<00:03:09.960> I'll<00:03:10.740> take<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.220> base<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.670> metal<00:03:11.910> base

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that I'll take the base the metal base

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.000 
that I'll take the base the metal base
there<00:03:12.360> clean<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.960> around<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.500> edges<00:03:13.590> off

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
there clean it up around the edges off

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.400 
there clean it up around the edges off
and<00:03:14.040> weld<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> bottom<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.960> then<00:03:16.200> maybe

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and weld it to the bottom and then maybe

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.430 
and weld it to the bottom and then maybe
we'll<00:03:16.650> stick<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.760> fuel<00:03:18.360> check<00:03:18.780> valve<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.230> there

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
we'll stick a fuel check valve in there

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.780 
we'll stick a fuel check valve in there
and<00:03:19.620> maybe<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.690> filler<00:03:21.690> valve<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.320> busy<00:03:22.950> day<00:03:23.220> okay

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and maybe a filler valve a busy day okay

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.460 
and maybe a filler valve a busy day okay
yeah<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.630> doesn't<00:03:24.810> sound<00:03:25.020> like<00:03:25.140> much<00:03:25.260> but

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
yeah it doesn't sound like much but

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
yeah it doesn't sound like much but
we'll<00:03:26.040> be<00:03:26.190> probably<00:03:26.550> working<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:26.940> for<00:03:27.090> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
we'll be probably working here for a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.780 
we'll be probably working here for a
good<00:03:27.240> 8<00:03:27.420> hours<00:03:27.570> 10<00:03:27.930> hours<00:03:28.520> what's<00:03:29.520> there
