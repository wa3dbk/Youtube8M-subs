00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.210
 in that video we are going to make division 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 with decimal point and we do this 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.150
 Exercise 15 between 19.25 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.869
 and we will do it with the following 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.020
 structure inside the division 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.420
 we have the dividend outside we have the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.810
 divisor up to the quotient and down 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.949
 to the residue in our fiscal year 15 is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 the dividend the 19.25 is the divisor the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.610
 quotient and the remainder we are going to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.970
 calculate and here we have them accommodated 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.040
 when in a division the divisor has 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.830
 decimal point is made of the following 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.140
 so how many numbers you look at 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.490
 right from the decimal point 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.020
 we have in this case are 2 on 2 and 5 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.780
 then the decimal point is going to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.420
 travel two places to the right and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 well let's get as divisor in 1925 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.530
 we open the division 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.750
 now the 15 when we have a number 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.939
 whole the decimal point is in 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.210
 the bottom right in this part 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.490
 from here then we will go through this 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.710
 decimal point the number of times that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.990
 we went through the decimal point in the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.720
 divider remember we went through two 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.509
 places then this decimal point will 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.689
 it travels two places that is to say it moves 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.590
 here in those spaces where there is no 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.229
 numbers let's add zeros 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 so we're going to have inside the division 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.810
 as a dividend to 1500 now to be able 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.179
 perform the operations of this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 division let's write the table of 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.189
 divisor that is the table of 1925 and here 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.049
 we have it where the divisor that is 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.880
 1925 we multiply it by one after 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.240
 by two by three and so on 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 until 10 and we started to solve 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.850
 our division where outside of this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.190
 we have four digits in we have 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.259
 four that are to the left of the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.579
 decimal point then we ask 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.579
 the following how many times does 1925 fit in 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.489
 1500 does not fit any time since this 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.910
 number is bigger than in 1500 and 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.680
 we wrote a zero 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 and we multiply 0 by 1925 is equal to 0 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.040
 and we wrote it down 1500 but 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.500
 subtracting 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.340
 when performing the subtraction 1,500 minus zero 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 we have left 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.879
 1500 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.549
 now in the dividend we have no more 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.680
 numbers to the right then we go 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.930
 to add a zero to the right of the point 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.560
 decimal and that does not affect the dividend 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 this zero we lower it in the part of the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.560
 residue and so we have the number 15,000 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.860
 besides the decimal point we upload it from 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.739
 shape aligned to the quotient and we apply 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 the same procedure how many times 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.069
 every time 1925 in the 15,000 supporting us from 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.950
 our table we realize that it fits 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 7 times since from 8 it goes through 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 that in 1925 x 8 is equal to 15,400 which is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 bigger than 15,000 then 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.239
 we write 7 in the quotient and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.810
 we multiply 1925 by 7 is equal to 13 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.319
 thousand 475 and we wrote it down but 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.319
 subtracting 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.690
 and we performed the operation first 05 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.640
 but you can not so this 0 asks 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.680
 a unit lent to the number that is 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.750
 his left but also in 0 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 then he can not lend him so 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.260
 is 0 asks for a borrowed unit 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.270
 number on your left 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.760
 curiously it is also 0 then 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.590
 he can not lend him either so he's 0 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.080
 asks for a unit borrowed from the number 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.690
 which is on your left that is 5 like that 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 this 5 becomes 4 and this 0 is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.550
 convert to 10 now since it is 10 it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.800
 can lend a unit to 0 that is 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.470
 the right then this 10 becomes 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.650
 in 9 and this 0 becomes 10 of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.840
 same way this 0 as it is already 10 is going 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.090
 to lend a unit to this zero 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.150
 so this 0 becomes 9 and this 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.410
 last one becomes 10 and we have 10 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:34.270
 minus 5 equals 5 9 minus 7 equals 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.470
 at 29 minus 4 equals 54 minus three is 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.520
 equal to 11 minus one equals zero 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.020
 then we have as residue 1525 and 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.759
 as the receipt is not zero 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.729
 we must continue so in the 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.250
 dividend we add another zero of equal 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.789
 way does not affect the dividend this 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.479
 zero we lower it and now we have down the 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.229
 number 15,250 and we apply the same 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.560
 process 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:06.699
 how many times does it fit in 1925 at 15,250 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.039
 supporting us from our table we give ourselves 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.840
 account that fits again seven times already 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.409
 that from eight passes because 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.880
 from eight is 15,400 then in the 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:22.810
 quotient we write the 7 and multiply 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.400
 1925 by 7 equals 13 thousand 475 and what 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.759
 we write down but subtracting 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.250
 and we do the subtraction first 05 do not know 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.600
 can so this 0 asks for a unit 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.630
 lent to the number that is at your 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.630
 left that is 5 then this 5 is 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.270
 convert to 4 and this 0 to 10 then 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.600
 we have ten minus five equals 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.380
 five 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.330
 now 47 can not either so this 4 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.670
 asks for a unit borrowed from the number 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.620
 which is on your left that is 2 that 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.990
 2 becomes 1 and this 4 becomes 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.700
 becomes 14 then we have 14 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.830
 minus 7 equals 7 then one minus 4 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.690
 you can not either so the 1 asks 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.030
 a unit lent to the number that is 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.760
 your left that is 5 so 5 is 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.150
 converts to 4 and 1 becomes 11 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.680
 then we have 11 minus 4 equals 7 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.500
 then we have 4 minus three equals 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.140
 one and then one minus one is equal to 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.720
 zero and we're going to leave the 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.530
 division up here then we have 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.210
 as quotient 0.77 and as residue 1.775 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.340
 but you can continue adding 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.030
 a zero in the dividend and this zero 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.070
 lowering it in the part of the residue 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:49.070
 then the result of dividing 15 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:49.070
 between 19.25 approximately is 0.77 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.860
