00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
parts of all these items we just took

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
parts of all these items we just took
out<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> box<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.369> includes<00:01:27.060> an<00:01:27.300> easy

out of the box it also includes an easy
four-step<00:01:28.259> assembly<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.700> our

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
four-step assembly so we can get our

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.870 
four-step assembly so we can get our
vacuum<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.899> going<00:01:31.710> okay<00:01:32.220> our<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.580> piece

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
vacuum up and going okay our first piece

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.430 
vacuum up and going okay our first piece
we're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.420> take<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> look<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
we're going to take a look at is the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.580 
we're going to take a look at is the
base<00:01:34.649> this<00:01:35.160> is<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> main<00:01:35.610> part<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.030> vacuum

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
base this is the main part of the vacuum

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
base this is the main part of the vacuum
the<00:01:37.590> next<00:01:37.920> piece<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.850> backbone<00:01:39.450> which

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the next piece is the backbone which

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.139 
the next piece is the backbone which
will<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.560> into<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.160> base<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.910> put<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
will go into the base when we put it

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.359 
will go into the base when we put it
together<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.690> then<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> handle

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
together and then we have the handle

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
together and then we have the handle
she's<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> allow<00:01:45.180> us<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.540> push<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
she's going to allow us to push the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260 
she's going to allow us to push the
vacuum<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> room<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.940> have<00:01:48.090> our

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
vacuum around the room then we have our

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.609 
vacuum around the room then we have our
extension<00:01:49.020> wand<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> turbo<00:01:51.240> nozzle

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
extension wand we have the turbo nozzle

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.070 
extension wand we have the turbo nozzle
we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.130> dusting<00:01:53.610> brush<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.840> have

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
we have the dusting brush and we have

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.050 
we have the dusting brush and we have
the<00:01:55.320> crevice<00:01:55.710> tool<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.490> last<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.940> not

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the crevice tool and the last but not

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.020 
the crevice tool and the last but not
least<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.990> desk<00:01:58.200> top<00:01:58.909> okay<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
least we have the desk top okay the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
least we have the desk top okay the
first<00:02:00.210> step<00:02:00.479> we're<00:02:00.690> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.470> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
first step we're going to do is to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760 
first step we're going to do is to
attach<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.909> backbone<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> base<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.170> if

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
attach the backbone to the base and if

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.140 
attach the backbone to the base and if
you're<00:02:04.920> uncertain<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.580> it's<00:02:05.760> supposed<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> go

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
you're uncertain how it's supposed to go

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.030 
you're uncertain how it's supposed to go
just<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.900> bottom<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> notice

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
just look on the bottom and you notice

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.949 
just look on the bottom and you notice
the<00:02:08.280> different<00:02:08.670> sizes<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> rectangle

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the different sizes we have a rectangle

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.350 
the different sizes we have a rectangle
and<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.080> square<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.679> matches<00:02:11.130> up<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and a square and it matches up with the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.090 
and a square and it matches up with the
square<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> rectangle<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> base<00:02:13.769> now

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
square and the rectangle on the base now

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.470 
square and the rectangle on the base now
we're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.549> attach<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> backbone<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
we're going to attach the backbone to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920 
we're going to attach the backbone to
the<00:02:15.720> base<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.830> by<00:02:17.040> lining<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.489> up<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.750> want

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the base just by lining it up you want

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.020 
the base just by lining it up you want
to<00:02:19.019> rock<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.850> until

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.809 

creek<00:02:24.030> detached<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:26.220> we're<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.549> attach

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
creek detached now we're going to attach

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.899 
creek detached now we're going to attach
