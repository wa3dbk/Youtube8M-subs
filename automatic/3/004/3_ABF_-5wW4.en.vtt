problem that this story could easily

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.100 
problem that this story could easily
fences<00:04:54.920> just<00:04:55.340> having<00:04:55.970> too<00:04:56.180> much<00:04:56.330> going<00:04:56.690> on<00:04:56.780> it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
fences just having too much going on it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.380 
fences just having too much going on it
at<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.410> center<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.950> fly<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:59.180> fight

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
at the center and the fly that the fight

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.180 
at the center and the fly that the fight
that<00:04:59.600> breaks<00:04:59.900> loose<00:05:00.260> was<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.560> bit<00:05:00.860> hard<00:05:01.130> to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
that breaks loose was a bit hard to

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.050 
that breaks loose was a bit hard to
follow<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:02.530> sometimes<00:05:03.530> it's<00:05:04.220> quite

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
follow but sometimes it's quite

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.510 
follow but sometimes it's quite
different<00:05:05.480> so<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.410> problem<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.220> story

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
different so the problem that this story

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.300 
different so the problem that this story
could<00:05:08.060> easily<00:05:08.480> face<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.530> thing<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.070> though

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
could easily face this thing so though

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.850 
could easily face this thing so though
we<00:05:10.340> will<00:05:11.000> see<00:05:11.300> how<00:05:11.600> things<00:05:11.870> shape<00:05:12.290> up<00:05:12.440> aside

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
we will see how things shape up aside

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.960 
we will see how things shape up aside
