closer together he tends arches back a

closer together he tends arches back a
little<00:03:44.250> bit<00:03:44.659> I'd<00:03:45.659> like<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.019> make<00:03:46.230> some<00:03:46.440> closing

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
little bit I'd like to make some closing

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.119 
little bit I'd like to make some closing
remarks<00:03:47.120> about<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.450> forward<00:03:48.780> approach<00:03:49.129> first

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
remarks about the forward approach first

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.530 
remarks about the forward approach first
of<00:03:50.220> all<00:03:50.280> remember<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:51.120> probably<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
of all remember that it's probably the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.670 
of all remember that it's probably the
first<00:03:51.720> thing<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.200> you're<00:03:52.379> going<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> learn

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
first thing that you're going to learn

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
first thing that you're going to learn
what<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.190> last<00:03:53.400> thing<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.700> you're<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:53.910> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
what the last thing that you're going to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.900 
what the last thing that you're going to
master<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.540> by<00:03:54.720> far<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.200> most<00:03:55.379> difficult

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
master it is by far the most difficult

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.660 
master it is by far the most difficult
part<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.030> diving<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.950> some<00:03:58.950> people<00:03:59.280> overlook

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
part of diving and some people overlook

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.270 
part of diving and some people overlook
that<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.120> tend<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.140> not<00:04:01.290> work<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.739> hurdle<00:04:02.099> and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
that and tend to not work the hurdle and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920 
that and tend to not work the hurdle and
the<00:04:02.370> hurdle<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.000> something<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.660> work

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the hurdle is something you have to work

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.900 
the hurdle is something you have to work
on<00:04:04.110> literally<00:04:04.410> every<00:04:04.530> single<00:04:05.220> practice<00:04:05.459> I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
on literally every single practice I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.140 
on literally every single practice I
know<00:04:06.510> here<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:07.349> IU<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.430> first<00:04:08.670> thing<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:08.940> do<00:04:09.060> in

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
know here at IU the first thing we do in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.479 
know here at IU the first thing we do in
the<00:04:09.209> morning<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.569> start<00:04:09.599> on<00:04:09.930> hurdles<00:04:10.829> on<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
the morning we start on hurdles on the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.619 
the morning we start on hurdles on the
dry<00:04:11.670> land<00:04:11.879> board<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.359> don't<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.599> a

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
dry land board if you don't have a

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.020 
dry land board if you don't have a
dryland<00:04:13.019> board<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:13.980> meter<00:04:14.190> spring<00:04:14.790> boards

dryland board one meter spring boards

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.719 
dryland board one meter spring boards
just<00:04:15.269> fine<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.199> takes<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.470> lot<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> work<00:04:16.919> the

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
just fine but it takes a lot of work the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.219 
just fine but it takes a lot of work the
other<00:04:17.850> thing<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.180> important<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.840> to

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
other thing is important that you to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.659 
other thing is important that you to
remember<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.829> have<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.220> separate

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
remember is that you have to separate

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.689 
remember is that you have to separate
the<00:04:20.940> hurdle<00:04:21.660> from<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> dive<00:04:22.160> most<00:04:23.160> divers<00:04:23.580> is

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
the hurdle from the dive most divers is

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.040 
the hurdle from the dive most divers is
to<00:04:23.789> get<00:04:23.940> out<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.180> their<00:04:24.300> last<00:04:24.510> steps<00:04:24.810> start

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
to get out in their last steps start

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.659 
to get out in their last steps start
thinking<00:04:25.320> about<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.830> dive<00:04:26.010> rather<00:04:26.430> than

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
thinking about the dive rather than

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.250 
thinking about the dive rather than
focusing<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.270> getting<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.840> end<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.169> the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
focusing on getting to the end of the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.290 
focusing on getting to the end of the
board<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.740> setting<00:04:29.340> up<00:04:29.460> with<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.639> good<00:04:29.850> hurdle

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
board and setting up with a good hurdle

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.820 
board and setting up with a good hurdle
you<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:30.960> necessarily<00:04:31.110> need<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.590> great

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you don't necessarily need a great

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.040 
you don't necessarily need a great
hurdle<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.639> very<00:04:32.850> very<00:04:32.910> good<00:04:33.120> dive<00:04:33.479> but

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
hurdle to do a very very good dive but

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.050 
hurdle to do a very very good dive but
you<00:04:34.200> certainly<00:04:34.530> need<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.710> decent<00:04:35.160> one<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
you certainly need a decent one and I

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.820 
you certainly need a decent one and I
think<00:04:36.270> especially<00:04:36.570> in<00:04:36.870> competition<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.680> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
think especially in competition it's a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.710 
think especially in competition it's a
critical<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.700> focus<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.479> end<00:04:39.690> of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
critical that you focus on the end of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.990 
critical that you focus on the end of
the<00:04:39.810> board<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.229> set<00:04:40.950> up<00:04:41.099> with<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.700> other

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the board and set up with that the other

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240 
the board and set up with that the other
thing<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.539> remember<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.680> it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
thing is to remember that it's a it's

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.820 
thing is to remember that it's a it's
technique<00:04:44.760> not<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:45.810> power<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.590> want<00:04:46.770> to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
technique not just power and you want to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.529 
technique not just power and you want to
be<00:04:46.919> able<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.130> use<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.820> technique<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.479> the

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
be able to use the technique and the

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.390 
be able to use the technique and the
laws<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.750> physics<00:04:49.349> to<00:04:49.410> allow<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.160> really

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
laws of physics to allow you to really

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.120 
laws of physics to allow you to really
ride<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:50.910> board<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:52.380> finally<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.070> other

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
ride that board and finally the other

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.040 
ride that board and finally the other
thing<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.550> perhaps<00:04:54.120> most<00:04:54.419> important<00:04:54.930> is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
thing is perhaps most important is

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.330 
thing is perhaps most important is
getting<00:04:55.169> to<00:04:55.380> what<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.530> call<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.950> magic

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
getting to what I call that magic

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.680 
getting to what I call that magic
position<00:04:56.820> where<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.030> board's<00:04:57.300> all<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.570> way

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
position where the board's all the way

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.230 
position where the board's all the way
down<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.620> arms<00:04:58.889> are<00:04:59.039> 12<00:04:59.310> o'clock<00:04:59.639> if<00:04:59.970> you

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
down and the arms are 12 o'clock if you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240 
down and the arms are 12 o'clock if you
get<00:05:00.450> there<00:05:00.690> you'll<00:05:00.870> you'll<00:05:01.380> have<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.590> sensation

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
get there you'll you'll have a sensation

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.790 
get there you'll you'll have a sensation
that<00:05:02.400> or<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.060> sense<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.870> lot<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.289> divers<00:05:04.620> do

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
that or a sense that a lot of divers do

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.560 
that or a sense that a lot of divers do
that<00:05:05.039> right<00:05:05.669> before<00:05:05.820> they<00:05:06.060> leave<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.330> board

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
that right before they leave the board

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.879 
that right before they leave the board
they<00:05:06.720> sense<00:05:07.289> that<00:05:07.380> they're<00:05:07.560> going<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.770> do<00:05:07.860> a

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
they sense that they're going to do a

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.770 
they sense that they're going to do a
great<00:05:08.130> dive<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.580> that's<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.970> basically

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
great dive and that's it basically

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.900 
great dive and that's it basically
because<00:05:10.200> they've<00:05:10.889> set<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.310> dive<00:05:11.490> up<00:05:11.729> they've

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
because they've set the dive up they've
