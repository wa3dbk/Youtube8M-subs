00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.870
 but here I am back so after 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.490
 multiple small adjustments I had put a 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.530
 mass son if it turned out that it was 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.999
 not that because after a while I 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.129
 started to see my ignition that went 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.620
 put on smoking who smelled the wire rack 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.210
 so quickly I have to disconnect everything 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.590
 now I suspect maybe a 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.100
 ignition coil which are a small 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.780
 little disabled so an ignition and equipped 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.970
 of several coils inside and there 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.830
 may have a slightly tired 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.660
 So here like I said I am 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.900
 sure to get the new sprinklers 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.940
 so this is 95 so 95 for the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.090
 French and this is the one that was 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.460
 original on 1 90 90 for the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.489
 French and I also bought fire 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 what is currently being put on 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.700
 the carburetors so I changed my 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.020
 body is I put another course 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 is not what I had 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.510
 it was a corner like this so 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.329
 built with little holes and a 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.989
 move to the mayor to fall from corner 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.520
 so here with passages here on 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.280
 sides like that here we see them well 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.659
 here and of course they were a little 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.960
 little crushed also inside 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.670
 So here I am, I changed my candle 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.830
 it's an old candle I'm going 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.470
 there my candle 9 is here that I removed 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.049
 here is who we are here we will necessarily a 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.380
 meal well wait here is the candle 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.409
 is here and we can see 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.060
 that she is always less so I have 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.860
 took an old candle for me for 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.630
 see close test because on a 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.240
 new candle we do not see well the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.189
 settings yes little trick I have 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 noted the sting that is here at 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.880
 middle in the zoo wood was set on 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.369
 the position in the middle so I light the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.229
 lowest position I do not have 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.119
 still performed test like that so 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.830
 we will see together 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.430
 I will try to get it started 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.430
 without breaking my face 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 Oh 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.450
 this is normal that they stop the 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.640
 setting manage the slow it's too much 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.069
 down I do them on purpose because I have 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.239
 lost the little thing here for the contact 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.799
 so I do not know how to turn it off at the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.090
 hand so that they stall alone 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.840
 so here we see that there is a clear 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.659
 improvement 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.590
 so of course I have to sneak and 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.659
 tweak and improve the settings so 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.930
 I do not know if I feel like staying 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.720
 we say it's set to 110 or so if I 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.819
 put in 95 in 95 that's if I type the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.480
 settings at 85 you have to know that my 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.230
 candle always stays black here I come 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.139
 to do a test 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.849
 we'll say it's going fast but there's even 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.799
 not five minutes I did a test 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:08.560
 a little longer and I did what we 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:10.450
 call a stop candles and of course 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.409
 it's very hot so we're going 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.590
 look together 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.829
 of course the state of the candle here and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.709
 as you can see well 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.220
 we are all black 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.780
 here I tried to do that 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.250
 removing the body is therefore necessarily 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.270
 the weak scooter 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.460
 but the candle is still all black 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.170
 that's what I do not understand 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.230
 asks if there really is not a problem at 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.880
 carburetor so surely that in the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 first juices in the next days I 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.350
 will try to find a carburetor 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.290
 even original no matter how much you care 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.630
 and of course try to mount it on 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.850
 to make it turn see what is it 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.600
 that he tells 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:00.650
 So here you are 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.330
 ah yes little anecdote I had left the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.640
 wire connected and sometimes and there necessarily 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.600
 at power started a little has 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.930
 smoked smoked it not clear that he felt 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.910
 really serious the burnt plastic so 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.140
 I removed the rope the little famous 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.090
 son passing by then which were 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.880
 connected to the coil and where to crank that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.140
 I disconnected because it turned out 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.140
 that in fact it was not a problem of 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.710
 hall is grounding this is ah 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.990
 yes small little question too so I 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.050
 am at the moment we are gt we will say 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.520
 in configuration kit 70 centimeters 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.330
 cubes so 70 cubic centimeters top 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.190
 performance clapper original fuel 17 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.600
 and a half with a 90 nozzle that 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.270
 now I just removed of course 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.110
 with a pot but the thing is that good 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.180
 the bottle here of gasoline mix at this 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.290
 goal 6 5 or 6% I do not know exactly anymore 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.270
 should I check was full and 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.729
 see which reason the bottle and I 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.000
 had to turn maybe to the bottom with 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.860
 stone 20 minutes 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.479
 so that's normal or not honestly 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.240
 I'm wondering 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.520
 so here I am surely going to refine the 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.370
 settings 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.690
 in 95 because good it's still a 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.160
 scooter to go to work not for 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.500
 do the compet so if they start 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.190
 to drink liters to 10 kilometers on 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.560
 not going to get there 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.789
 so that's if you have topics 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.199
 perhaps small 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.849
 improvements to make that would be good 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.569
 friendly and of course always your 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.310
 comments on this famous common that 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.960
 sometimes I saw when it was working the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.199
 scooter work relatively well 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.599
 I saw that it would have looked like 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.569
 droplets of gasoline so I will judge 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.669
 that it is gasoline vapor 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.409
 so here in my opinion surely 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.120
 something in there I know I 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.490
 really do not know the system at all 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.970
 of the lung so I'm really new to 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.069
 in there 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.900
 so I presume that there is surely a 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.550
 spring with a kind of membranes a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.370
 little like an expansion vessel of 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.919
 central heating and so who 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.569
 when one accelerates he would come to put 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.560
 store gasoline vapors or 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.349
 possibly droplets 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.849
 of gasoline and canton of zac salary I 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.430
 suppose a bit like the effect of a turbo 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.229
 bailly release these gases in the in 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.710
 the engine to avoid losing 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:28.090
 torque at the ex bank to deceleration 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.289
 if we can say so here are all 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.380
 the little things and all the little ones 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.319
 tips are good to take especially 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.190
 for this sake of the gie who remains black 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.190
 thank you there is more
