00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
because I think we played on a good

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.400 
because I think we played on a good
level<00:00:26.180> we<00:00:27.180> play<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.710> amazing<00:00:28.710> second<00:00:29.070> health

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
level we play the amazing second health

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.190

think the belief is in the team the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
think the belief is in the team the
belief<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> players<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.590> look
