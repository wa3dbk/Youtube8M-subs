00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.930
 Ha 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.790
 Hello and Happy say this video of Masterpiece Transformers 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.400
 Bumblebee 2 bullets 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:20.619
 Last time I did the transformation of the spike of this excel suit this time 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.640
 I would like to see a bangle. The reproduction of this car in vehicle mode is true. 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 It is amazing to 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 Beetle just as it is 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.740
 Taking advantage of the Cybertron mark of the bonnet 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 So it looks like this 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.520
 Laser gun here 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.579
 Can be stored 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.670
 It will be lost prevention 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.480
 And it can also be mounted at the same time spare tire cover 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.950
 I This eliminates the loss of accessories 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.000
 Furthermore, it does not affect the installation, so you can roll and play as it is 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.170
 Remove this spare tire cover 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 You can also attach it to this number plate part here 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 You can remove the cover of the license plate as it is 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.520
 The cover of the license plate that I removed though the fine technique is fine is a spare tire 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 The position of the cover can be stored in 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 I am very happy with this kind of care 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.260
 And it will be more like installing 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 So let's bubble the French phone 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.200
 At first it is good 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.829
 We shift the front bonnet 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.680
 Here is the first step in transformation and 9 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.080
 It feels like it extends the lower accident from the waist 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.960
 Then bend the bend 9 bonnet cover to 90 degrees 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.020
 Split the front hood into two 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 This bonnet part will be toe and store all flights 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 th 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:04.000
 Rotate to 90 degrees The other side is the same 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.000
 There is a hinge on the door part, but I bend it in two places 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.229
 Same goes for the other side 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.620
 1 step 2 steps bending 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.860
 This is the completion of the leg part 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.860
 Then remove the arm joint stored in the back of the body 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 This part corresponds to 3 bodies will be an arm 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:33.610
 I can see from here, but the window part is clear blue 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.599
 And it feels like the roof part is painted yellow on this clear blue part 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.840
 is not it 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.980
 Calling and arm down 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.980
 Open arms once 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.270
 Then slide the parts of the tail lamp part 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.960
 Pull out the fist stored in the arm part 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.050
 I pull out the other side 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.050
 It is a 180 degree rotation from the second arm in this state 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.239
 Then beat the rule part and rotate it 180 degrees 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.239
 Rotate around 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.240
 When turned, fold the via bumper inward 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.190
 I will store 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.410
 Then look behind 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.380
 Tokei and Hana have this part and this part are here to fit and slide 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.910
 I will 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.910
 This is the completion of your back 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.910
 Press the Buch section to bring out the mark of Nishihata 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.910
 All round will rotate 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.050
 Now adjust the parts to complete the bumble 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.220
 I went around round and round I will rotate the neck joint 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.500
 further 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.670
 Back up and down 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.670
 The shoulder part is 20 joints. There are 3 places of deformation mechanism and ball joint. 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.390
 Second arm rotates 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.670
 Maintenance is also opened 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.440
 The wrist is only at the deformation mechanism, but it does not rotate 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.070
 Dongfeng turns around 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.350
 The instructor military freedom is very high 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.350
 The operation of the hip joint is also very flexible. 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.120
 There are also two joints in the knee part, so if you use the deformation mechanism and the knee part as well 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.350
 It is quite high in medium level of posing 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.350
 The ankle also moves 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.150
 And face change 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.620
 This part can be replaced 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.620
 This is a smiley expression 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.930
 Here it is the privilege of the battle face of the Amazon 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.250
 It is the face of the toy version of those days 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.750
 I 'm familiar with here, with a laser gun and stand in your favorite pose 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.330
 I can do it 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.330
 It is also compatible with the chair longitude parts quite well 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.779
 You can also take the face people with a certain excessive form because there is a very large back of the ground surface of the foot 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:17.069
 It can be self-sustaining 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:23.370
 This is a great joint , including the deformation mechanism of this knee 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:29.569
 It may be called a double joint, so the degree of freedom can be expanded considerably because there is this 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:32.749
 And pressing strongly fixed snap because I think Naa has been built wow 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:38.000
 Because this master face series is really built in 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:42.680
 I hope very parentheses vehicle mode nor robot mode 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.080
 The Minibot series at the time was so monotonous that it was so elaborate 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.750
 It was not 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:53.310
 I am impressed that the flow of the times is really great 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.360
 However, there is also a feature that the thing at the time is only monotonous and can be transformed many times and played . 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.870
 Yes 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.580
 It 's better to play with this person 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.960
 I think there are also a lot of elements to enjoy decorating, so it 's also a bit too much fun to come 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.169
 I will feel Tteyuu waste Kana 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.200
 I like very parentheses proportions 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.950
 It is cool than in the play of anime 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.710
 In the dubbed version was the sputum of Teku imports had been aired 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:23.760
 I also felt that there was no way you could draw 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.390
 I think that it is a good combination that spikes are attached along with Bumble this time 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.320
 Was 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.730
 Is there is also opportunity because it does not remember clearly also because the story and works 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.320
 I would like to see it again 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:38.640
 Certainly there is an impression that bumble and spike were often together 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.870
 Sam and Bumblebee of live-action movies and I wonder if what is everywhere sides tribute something 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.150
 I try to understand 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:51.560
 Hand from simply nostalgia because the relevance Toka so much there Rahen core place of no knowledge 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.560
 Thank you for watching it was more than happy I was a product of feeling
