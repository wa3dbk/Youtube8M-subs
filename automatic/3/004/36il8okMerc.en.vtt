00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.990
 good afternoon my favorite viewers today 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.869
 we will bake the royal cheesecake the most 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.990
 in the simplest way, first we light 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.060
 the start-up oven is heated to a temperature of 180 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 degrees preparation of this cake 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.090
 takes very , very little time 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.899
 products need very little and for this 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.239
 we need cottage cheese 500 grams 3 eggs 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.410
 somewhere around 60 grams creamy 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.280
 oils 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.059
 flour will add half a mile 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.539
 clean and 2 3 cups of sugar 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:01:05.110
 sand 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:01:09.690
 all three eggs in a bowl there sugar 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.690
 and all this we start beating 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:26.399
 you can fork mixer can be there for 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.399
 add 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:55.159
 it's all well stirring and take 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:57.460
 butter and more flour do not let 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.970
 because there is no and fingers start 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.970
 all knead doing baby 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.200
 and as you do will 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:26.050
 understandable need flour or not and therefore 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:32.540
 it is not clear and let here so 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.230
 it turns out that there was no such from 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.780
 lumps 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:43.940
 all must be very finely finely finely 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:48.860
 I will help for example for my amount 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.810
 oil and not even not quite sure that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.850
 there are probably 60 more 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.880
 a gram can be 90 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.920
 I think that it was I would have enough 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:08.710
 Now take the form I have here such Wait 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:17.950
 with removable bottom cover and put it there 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:17.950
 our little tea make up 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.950
 Now 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:47.560
 uniformly pour our bargaining and top 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.560
 we cover with the remained crumb 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.460
 Now we put the oven for 3 minutes and 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.190

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.890

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.440
 40 minutes there was an awesome smell 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.170

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.400

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:24.380
 cooling down he crouches let's say 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.690
 sags don't be upset when you chop 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.470
