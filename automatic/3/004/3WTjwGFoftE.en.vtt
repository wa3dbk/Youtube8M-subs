00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
days to a better grocery budget series
last<00:00:29.400> year<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.869> written

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

last year and that was just a written
series<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.550> felt<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.120> be

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
series and I felt like it would be

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
series and I felt like it would be
really<00:00:33.239> good<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.930> something<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.469> was

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
really good to do something that was

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.299 
really good to do something that was
more<00:00:34.620> hands-on<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.760> visual<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.870> every<00:00:37.829> Monday

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
