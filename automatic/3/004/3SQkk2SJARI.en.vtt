00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
I can use that trying to get a toxic

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.640 
I can use that trying to get a toxic
just<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.780> make<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.140> thing<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.320> bit<00:00:35.440> suicidal

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
just to make that thing a bit suicidal

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.890 
just to make that thing a bit suicidal
toxic<00:00:36.580> life<00:00:36.699> or<00:00:36.910> kill<00:00:37.239> himself<00:00:37.390> off<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.840> a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
toxic life or kill himself off in a

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.189 
toxic life or kill himself off in a
couple<00:00:38.019> of<00:00:38.260> turns<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.479> his<00:00:40.479> low<00:00:40.659> kick<00:00:40.870> did<00:00:41.049> a

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
couple of turns so his low kick did a

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.020 
couple of turns so his low kick did a
bit<00:00:41.799> of<00:00:41.830> damage<00:00:42.040> but<00:00:42.339> he<00:00:42.580> realizes<00:00:42.850> that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
bit of damage but he realizes that

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.910 
bit of damage but he realizes that
double<00:00:43.960> hit<00:00:44.080> will<00:00:44.229> probably<00:00:44.559> do<00:00:44.680> a<00:00:44.710> lot<00:00:44.890> more

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
double hit will probably do a lot more

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.229 
double hit will probably do a lot more
so<00:00:45.370> he<00:00:45.460> goes<00:00:45.549> through<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:45.790> double<00:00:45.970> hit<00:00:46.089> and<00:00:46.180> it

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
so he goes through the double hit and it

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.289 
so he goes through the double hit and it
brings<00:00:46.390> me<00:00:46.479> down<00:00:46.799> it's<00:00:47.799> red<00:00:48.010> HP<00:00:48.309> when<00:00:49.239> I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
brings me down it's red HP when I

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.430 
brings me down it's red HP when I
anticipate<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:49.989> go<00:00:50.080> from<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.290> milk

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.200 
he tells me that he thought crunch was
not<00:05:12.260> very<00:05:12.440> effective<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:13.130> bug<00:05:13.340> type<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.790> I'm

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
not very effective on bug type and I'm

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.700 
not very effective on bug type and I'm
just<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:15.250> okay<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.450> he<00:05:17.960> went<00:05:18.350> for<00:05:18.650> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
just like okay so if he went for the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.680 
just like okay so if he went for the
crunch<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.220> probably<00:05:19.700> could<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.180> lived<00:05:20.419> but

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
crunch I probably could have lived but

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.719 
crunch I probably could have lived but
if<00:05:20.840> not<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.110> would<00:05:21.380> have<00:05:21.470> died<00:05:21.620> which<00:05:22.220> totally

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
if not I would have died which totally

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.060 
if not I would have died which totally
makes<00:05:22.760> sense<00:05:23.030> use<00:05:23.900> common<00:05:24.050> sense<00:05:24.229> so<00:05:24.710> he<00:05:24.890> would

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
makes sense use common sense so he would

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.409 
makes sense use common sense so he would
have<00:05:25.160> won<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.310> maybe<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:25.910> don't<00:05:26.060> know<00:05:26.210> who

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
have won that maybe I don't know who

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.210 
have won that maybe I don't know who
