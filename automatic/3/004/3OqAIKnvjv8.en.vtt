for<00:00:18.669> you<00:00:18.700> a<00:00:18.939> lot<00:00:19.210> of<00:00:19.390> that<00:00:19.509> is<00:00:19.660> because<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:19.960> all

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
for you a lot of that is because of all

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.319 
for you a lot of that is because of all
the<00:00:20.410> pruning<00:00:20.680> that<00:00:20.950> they<00:00:21.099> do<00:00:21.160> now<00:00:22.119> I<00:00:22.180> don't

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
the pruning that they do now I don't

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.760 
the pruning that they do now I don't
know<00:00:22.509> about<00:00:22.599> you<00:00:22.840> but<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.050> lot<00:00:23.110> of<00:00:23.349> people<00:00:23.590> I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
know about you but a lot of people I

know about you but a lot of people I
know<00:00:23.829> are<00:00:24.160> actually<00:00:24.489> sort<00:00:24.820> of<00:00:24.880> afraid<00:00:25.119> to

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
know are actually sort of afraid to

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.799 
know are actually sort of afraid to
prune

prune

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.870 
prune
I<00:00:25.840> call<00:00:26.200> it<00:00:26.349> prune<00:00:26.559> a<00:00:26.649> phobia<00:00:27.009> they<00:00:27.550> think<00:00:27.790> that

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
I call it prune a phobia they think that

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.280 
I call it prune a phobia they think that
they're<00:00:28.029> actually<00:00:28.210> going<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.540> damage<00:00:28.750> or<00:00:29.020> hurt

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
they're actually going to damage or hurt

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.380 
they're actually going to damage or hurt
their<00:00:29.500> plants<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:30.070> they're<00:00:30.579> probably<00:00:30.790> not<00:00:31.210> in

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
their plants and they're probably not in

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.060 
their plants and they're probably not in
fact<00:00:31.629> the<00:00:31.779> general<00:00:32.110> rule<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.379> thumb<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.770> only

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
fact the general rule of thumb is only

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.770 
fact the general rule of thumb is only
take<00:00:33.309> away<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.579> third<00:00:33.850> at<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.120> time<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.600> you're

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
take away a third at a time and you're

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.959 
take away a third at a time and you're
probably<00:00:35.050> going<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.469> be<00:00:35.590> just<00:00:35.860> fine<00:00:36.100> now<00:00:36.399> there

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
probably going to be just fine now there

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.310 
probably going to be just fine now there
are<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.090> number<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.329> reasons<00:00:37.690> why<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:37.899> should

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
are a number of reasons why you should

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.319 
are a number of reasons why you should
prune<00:00:38.680> first<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.309> all<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.820> increase<00:00:40.000> the

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
prune first of all to increase the

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.600 
prune first of all to increase the
overall<00:00:40.450> health<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.290> look<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.620> plant<00:00:41.950> now

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
overall health and look of the plant now

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.830 
overall health and look of the plant now
the<00:00:42.670> first<00:00:42.910> thing<00:00:43.060> you<00:00:43.150> want<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.360> do<00:00:43.510> when<00:00:43.720> you

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
the first thing you want to do when you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.600 
the first thing you want to do when you
get<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.380> there<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.650> look<00:00:44.680> around<00:00:44.920> you're

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
get in there and you look around you're

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.710 
get in there and you look around you're
gonna<00:00:45.700> find<00:00:45.970> some<00:00:46.180> branches<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.600> are

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
gonna find some branches that are

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.780 
gonna find some branches that are
probably<00:00:47.110> crossing<00:00:47.829> but<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.340> don't<00:00:48.550> want

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
probably crossing but you don't want

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.400 
probably crossing but you don't want
that<00:00:48.970> because<00:00:49.329> as<00:00:49.510> those<00:00:49.690> branches<00:00:49.989> cross

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
that because as those branches cross

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.290 
that because as those branches cross
they're<00:00:51.070> gonna<00:00:51.160> rub<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.610> bark<00:00:51.850> off<00:00:52.060> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
they're gonna rub the bark off and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.910 
they're gonna rub the bark off and
expose<00:00:52.720> it<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:52.989> potential<00:00:53.380> pests<00:00:53.770> and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
expose it to potential pests and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.550 
expose it to potential pests and
diseases<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.910> go<00:00:55.120> ahead<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:55.420> find<00:00:55.930> where

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
diseases so go ahead and find where

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.380 
diseases so go ahead and find where
those<00:00:56.680> branches<00:00:57.160> meet<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.670> trunk<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.120> cut

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
those branches meet the trunk and cut

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.180 
those branches meet the trunk and cut
out<00:00:58.480> at<00:00:58.630> least<00:00:58.810> one<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.200> them<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.800> next<00:00:59.980> thing

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
out at least one of them the next thing

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.979 
out at least one of them the next thing
you<00:01:00.280> want<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.460> look<00:01:00.610> for<00:01:00.820> are<00:01:01.059> dead<00:01:01.390> or<00:01:01.660> dying

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
you want to look for are dead or dying

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.720 
you want to look for are dead or dying
branches<00:01:02.380> you<00:01:02.980> certainly<00:01:03.309> don't<00:01:03.460> need<00:01:03.579> to

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
branches you certainly don't need to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.609 
branches you certainly don't need to
promote<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.269> or<00:01:04.570> leave<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.049> around<00:01:05.379> now

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
promote that or leave that around now

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.310 
promote that or leave that around now
one<00:01:06.579> of<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.759> obvious<00:01:07.000> reasons<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.810> prune<00:01:08.049> is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
one of the obvious reasons to prune is

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.050 
one of the obvious reasons to prune is
to<00:01:08.560> control<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.040> size<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.520> shape<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:09.939> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
to control the size and shape of the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.730 
to control the size and shape of the
shrubs<00:01:10.360> within<00:01:10.689> your<00:01:10.840> landscape<00:01:11.259> so<00:01:11.710> that

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
shrubs within your landscape so that

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.469 
shrubs within your landscape so that
they're<00:01:12.009> all<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:12.430> balance<00:01:12.909> but<00:01:13.270> here's

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
they're all in balance but here's

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.670 
they're all in balance but here's
something<00:01:13.720> I<00:01:13.810> want<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.140> keep<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.470> mind

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
something I want you to keep in mind

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.380 
something I want you to keep in mind
because<00:01:14.950> whenever<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.490> make<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.700> cut<00:01:16.000> you're

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
because whenever you make a cut you're

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.180 
because whenever you make a cut you're
going<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.570> stimulate<00:01:16.810> new<00:01:17.080> growth<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.770> be

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
going to stimulate new growth so be

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.010 
going to stimulate new growth so be
mindful<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.909> whenever<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.659> decide<00:01:19.960> on

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
mindful of that whenever you decide on

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.630 
mindful of that whenever you decide on
which<00:01:20.320> one<00:01:20.530> you're<00:01:20.650> going<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.830> cut<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.610> now

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
which one you're going to cut so now

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.370 
which one you're going to cut so now
that<00:01:21.850> we<00:01:22.120> know<00:01:22.150> why<00:01:22.540> we<00:01:22.720> should<00:01:22.750> prune<00:01:23.170> and

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
that we know why we should prune and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.170 
that we know why we should prune and
what<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:23.770> should<00:01:23.979> cut<00:01:24.159> back<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.729> question<00:01:24.909> is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
what we should cut back the question is

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.300 
what we should cut back the question is
when<00:01:25.630> do<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.229> well<00:01:26.770> for<00:01:26.979> general

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
when do we do that well for general

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.070 
when do we do that well for general
maintenance<00:01:27.490> such<00:01:27.909> as<00:01:27.940> taking<00:01:28.510> out<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.780> dead

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
maintenance such as taking out that dead

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.539 
maintenance such as taking out that dead
