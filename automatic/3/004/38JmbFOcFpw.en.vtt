hope you like it right let's take a look
inside<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.639> remember<00:00:12.450> when<00:00:12.840> removing<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.320> side

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
inside I remember when removing the side

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.560 
inside I remember when removing the side
panel<00:00:14.540> that<00:00:15.540> connector<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> same<00:00:16.560> time

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
panel that connector for the same time

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
panel that connector for the same time
I'm<00:00:18.570> careful<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:20.189> may

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
