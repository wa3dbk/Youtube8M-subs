up<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.570> suggest<00:00:51.690> keeping<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
up a bit so i would suggest keeping it

its<00:00:52.739> natural<00:00:53.340> pattern<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.420> those<00:00:54.600> hot<00:00:54.899> and

while<00:01:53.179> or<00:01:54.009> put<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.250> microwave<00:01:55.399> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
while or put it in the microwave and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.210 
while or put it in the microwave and
when<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.960> wash<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.380> out<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.860> hair<00:01:58.009> comes

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
when you wash it out like the hair comes

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.820 
when you wash it out like the hair comes
out<00:01:58.340> really<00:01:58.670> soft<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.270> shiny<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.110> i<00:02:00.590> probably

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
out really soft and shiny and i probably

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.800 
out really soft and shiny and i probably
uses<00:02:01.220> me<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:01.550> two<00:02:01.729> or<00:02:01.850> three<00:02:01.909> times<00:02:02.240> just<00:02:02.750> to

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
uses me like two or three times just to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.749 
uses me like two or three times just to
rejuvenate<00:02:03.110> my<00:02:03.530> hair<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:04.250> hair<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.550> medium

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
rejuvenate my hair this hair is medium

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.999 
rejuvenate my hair this hair is medium
to<00:02:05.149> low<00:02:05.300> luster<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.289> if<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.770> be

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
to low luster so if you're going to be

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.469 
to low luster so if you're going to be
blending<00:02:07.429> your<00:02:07.549> hair<00:02:07.820> instead<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.209> using<00:02:08.329> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
blending your hair instead of using a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.090 
blending your hair instead of using a
closure<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.840> think<00:02:09.049> it<00:02:09.170> would<00:02:09.320> be<00:02:09.440> easy<00:02:09.679> for<00:02:09.799> you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
closure I think it would be easy for you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.530 
closure I think it would be easy for you
to<00:02:10.220> blend<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.519> because<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:10.940> not<00:02:11.060> too<00:02:11.239> shiny

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
to blend it because it's not too shiny

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.750 
to blend it because it's not too shiny
it's<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:12.019> too<00:02:12.170> silky<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.280> would<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.549> easy

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
it's not too silky so it would be easy

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.490 
it's not too silky so it would be easy
to<00:02:13.880> blend<00:02:14.120> african-american<00:02:14.989> permed<00:02:15.380> or

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to blend african-american permed or

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.289 
to blend african-american permed or
natural<00:02:15.860> hair<00:02:16.070> with<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.820> get

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
natural hair with this here I get

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.120 
natural hair with this here I get

might<00:02:19.430> get<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:20.620> snag<00:02:21.620> here<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.070> there

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
might get like a snag here and there

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.280 
might get like a snag here and there
like<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.790> was<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> snag<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:23.930> i<00:02:23.959> might<00:02:24.170> get

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
like that that was a snag so i might get

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.050 
like that that was a snag so i might get
that<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:24.829> for<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> most<00:02:25.489> part<00:02:25.640> there's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that but for the most part there's

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
the hair is so long so at first it took

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.599 
the hair is so long so at first it took

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
me some time to get used to it because i

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.430 
me some time to get used to it because i
don't<00:02:35.120> think<00:02:35.239> i've<00:02:35.540> ever<00:02:35.570> had<00:02:35.959> here<00:02:36.230> that

reaches me this length so first it did

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.229 
reaches me this length so first it did

i'm a cashier sometimes when i'm around
the<00:02:43.760> register<00:02:44.209> i<00:02:44.480> would<00:02:44.750> fumble<00:02:45.049> because<00:02:45.829> like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the register i would fumble because like

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.470 
the register i would fumble because like
the<00:02:46.190> hair<00:02:46.370> would<00:02:46.489> get<00:02:46.640> caught<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.209> stuff

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
the hair would get caught up and stuff

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
the hair would get caught up and stuff
but<00:02:47.989> after<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.350> while<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.650> got<00:02:48.680> used<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
but after a while I got used to the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.699 
but after a while I got used to the
length<00:02:49.549> as<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.480> guys<00:02:50.690> can<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.440> curl

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
length as you guys can see the curl

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.410 
length as you guys can see the curl
pattern<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.250> still<00:02:52.489> popping<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.269> is

after I strained it and curled it of

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.970 
after I strained it and curled it of

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
course I use heat protection and

curling<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.769> only<00:03:06.950> thing<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.430> has<00:03:07.850> been

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
curling it the only thing that has been

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.110 
curling it the only thing that has been
altered<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:09.109> my<00:03:09.590> closure<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.579> actually<00:03:10.790> did

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
altered is my closure and I actually did

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.149 
altered is my closure and I actually did
that<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.359> purpose<00:03:11.390> because<00:03:12.379> if<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:12.980> guys

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
that on purpose because if you guys

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.530 
that on purpose because if you guys
watched<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.550> first<00:03:13.760> video<00:03:13.940> where<00:03:14.300> i<00:03:14.330> first

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
watched the first video where i first

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.170 
watched the first video where i first
installed<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.080> hair<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.890> closure<00:03:16.129> was<00:03:16.700> more

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
installed the hair the closure was more

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
installed the hair the closure was more
ringlets<00:03:17.689> rather<00:03:17.930> than<00:03:18.140> waves<00:03:18.409> so<00:03:19.219> I<00:03:19.250> actually

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
ringlets rather than waves so I actually

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.920 
ringlets rather than waves so I actually
manipulated<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.549> curls<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.390> straightened

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
manipulated the curls and straightened

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.349 
manipulated the curls and straightened
it<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:25.219> it<00:03:25.340> would<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.609> little<00:03:25.909> bit<00:03:26.150> more

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
it so that it would be a little bit more

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.270 
it so that it would be a little bit more
wavy<00:03:26.659> once<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:27.200> wet<00:03:27.409> it<00:03:27.439> back<00:03:27.709> rather<00:03:28.129> than

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
wavy once I wet it back rather than

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.649 
wavy once I wet it back rather than
curly<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:28.969> I<00:03:29.030> didn't<00:03:29.239> put<00:03:29.359> any<00:03:29.510> heat

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
curly so I didn't put any heat

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.209 
curly so I didn't put any heat
protecting<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.319> sort<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.709> gave<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.069> little

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.219 
protecting I sort of gave it a little

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.360 
protecting I sort of gave it a little
bit<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.459> heat<00:03:31.609> damage<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.680> now<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.739> closure

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
bit of heat damage and now the closure

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.209 
bit of heat damage and now the closure
blends<00:03:34.730> perfectly<00:03:35.139> with<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.739> left<00:03:36.889> it<00:03:37.040> here

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
blends perfectly with the left it here

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.610 
blends perfectly with the left it here
so<00:03:37.609> my<00:03:37.849> only<00:03:38.060> real<00:03:38.209> problem<00:03:38.569> was<00:03:38.989> basically

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
so my only real problem was basically

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.190 
so my only real problem was basically
the<00:03:39.950> ends<00:03:40.430> when<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.030> first<00:03:41.269> received<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.780> hair

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
the ends when I first received the hair

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.580 
the ends when I first received the hair
on<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.609> 26s<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.819> ends<00:03:44.180> were<00:03:44.510> very<00:03:44.810> coarse<00:03:45.260> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
on the 26s the ends were very coarse and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.709 
on the 26s the ends were very coarse and
I<00:03:45.950> don't<00:03:46.129> know<00:03:46.219> if<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.489> was<00:03:46.609> both<00:03:46.819> bundles<00:03:47.510> or

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
I don't know if it was both bundles or

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.349 
I don't know if it was both bundles or
just<00:03:47.930> one<00:03:48.139> bundle<00:03:48.379> but<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.069> know<00:03:49.189> it<00:03:49.370> was<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.849> 26

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
just one bundle but I know it was the 26

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.020 
just one bundle but I know it was the 26
inch<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.900> they<00:03:51.439> had<00:03:51.590> very<00:03:51.769> coarse<00:03:52.220> ends<00:03:52.849> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
inch and they had very coarse ends and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.929 
inch and they had very coarse ends and
it<00:03:53.750> would<00:03:53.930> increase<00:03:54.139> tangles<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.700> course

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
it would increase tangles and of course

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.190 
it would increase tangles and of course
when<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.150> hair<00:03:56.359> would<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:56.780> little<00:03:56.900> knots

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
when the hair would get the little knots

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.569 
when the hair would get the little knots
and<00:03:57.439> tangles<00:03:57.470> at<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.889> ends<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.430> would

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
and tangles at the ends it would

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:06.130 
and tangles at the ends it would
increase<00:03:58.819> shedding

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.860 

so<00:04:06.890> once<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.250> cut<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.640> ends<00:04:07.940> decrease<00:04:08.569> the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
so once I cut the ends decrease the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.530 
so once I cut the ends decrease the
shutting<00:04:09.170> entangling<00:04:10.209> significantly<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
shutting entangling significantly so I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.780 
shutting entangling significantly so I
really<00:04:11.959> don't<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.500> much<00:04:12.980> tingling

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
really don't get that much tingling

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.780 
really don't get that much tingling
which<00:04:14.180> therefore<00:04:15.160> decreases<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.430> shedding

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
which therefore decreases the shedding

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.520 
which therefore decreases the shedding
as<00:04:17.269> far<00:04:17.510> as<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.660> closure<00:04:17.900> everything<00:04:18.410> is

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
as far as the closure everything is

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.860 
as far as the closure everything is
installed<00:04:18.950> on<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.790> three<00:04:20.000> for<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:20.750> my

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
installed on a three for it so my

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.280 
installed on a three for it so my
closure<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.380> attached<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.160> my<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.400> part<00:04:22.760> and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
closure is attached to my you part and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.380 
closure is attached to my you part and
um<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:25.250> said<00:04:25.490> before<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.880> is<00:04:25.970> my<00:04:26.120> first

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
um as I said before this is my first

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.909 
um as I said before this is my first
time<00:04:26.570> using<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.960> closure<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.500> actually<00:04:27.650> use

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
time using a closure and I actually use

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.980 
time using a closure and I actually use
the<00:04:28.100> elastic<00:04:28.550> band<00:04:28.790> method<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.720> make<00:04:29.840> sure

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
the elastic band method to make sure

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.950 
the elastic band method to make sure
that<00:04:30.200> my<00:04:30.320> closure<00:04:30.560> lays<00:04:30.890> flat<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:32.630> am

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
that my closure lays flat and I am

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.190 
that my closure lays flat and I am
absolutely<00:04:33.140> in<00:04:33.860> love<00:04:34.160> with<00:04:34.850> closures<00:04:35.480> for

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
absolutely in love with closures for

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.810 
absolutely in love with closures for
several<00:04:36.590> different<00:04:36.680> reasons<00:04:36.919> for<00:04:37.310> one<00:04:37.610> I'm

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
several different reasons for one I'm

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.430 
several different reasons for one I'm
natural<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.480> a<00:04:38.510> lot<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:38.750> times<00:04:39.080> when<00:04:39.320> I'm

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
natural so a lot of times when I'm

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.550 
natural so a lot of times when I'm
blending<00:04:39.680> my<00:04:39.950> leave<00:04:40.160> out<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.490> get<00:04:40.669> heat<00:04:40.910> damage

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
blending my leave out I get heat damage

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.980 
blending my leave out I get heat damage
then<00:04:42.560> there's<00:04:42.770> also<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.820> versatility<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.630> a

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
then there's also the versatility of a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.530 
then there's also the versatility of a
closure<00:04:45.200> because<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.890> can<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.400> wear<00:04:46.640> my<00:04:47.210> part

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
closure because I can you wear my part

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.690 
closure because I can you wear my part
in<00:04:47.690> different<00:04:47.990> places<00:04:48.169> for<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.160> most<00:04:49.310> part<00:04:49.430> 1

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
in different places for the most part 1

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.950 
in different places for the most part 1
my<00:04:49.790> part<00:04:50.030> in<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.180> middle<00:04:50.390> part<00:04:50.510> of<00:04:50.660> as<00:04:50.810> you

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
my part in the middle part of as you

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.350 
my part in the middle part of as you
guys<00:04:51.110> can<00:04:51.410> see<00:04:51.470> today<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.010> have<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.610> side<00:04:52.970> part

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
guys can see today I have a side part

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.500 
guys can see today I have a side part
and<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:54.440> there<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.800> also<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.970> fact<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.300> is

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
and then there is also the fact that is

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.600 
and then there is also the fact that is
so<00:04:56.690> much<00:04:56.870> easier<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.530> maintain<00:04:57.710> your<00:04:58.160> style

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
so much easier to maintain your style

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.750 
so much easier to maintain your style
when<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.230> closure<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:00.980> I<00:05:01.010> am<00:05:01.340> just<00:05:01.370> in

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
when you have a closure so I am just in

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.200 
when you have a closure so I am just in
love<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.080> closure<00:05:03.350> came<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:04.160> it<00:05:04.580> had<00:05:04.880> no

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
love so the closure came and it had no

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.030 
love so the closure came and it had no
guards<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.840> guards<00:05:06.410> are<00:05:06.500> basically<00:05:06.830> like<00:05:07.010> a

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
guards and guards are basically like a

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.250 
guards and guards are basically like a
reinforcement<00:05:07.669> around<00:05:08.330> where<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.990> hair<00:05:09.230> is

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
reinforcement around where the hair is

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.870 
reinforcement around where the hair is
attached<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.070> lace<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:10.729> basically

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
attached to the lace so it's basically

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.990 
attached to the lace so it's basically
when<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.390> saw<00:05:11.660> on<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.840> closure<00:05:12.140> it<00:05:12.729> allows<00:05:13.729> it

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
when you saw on the closure it allows it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.750 
when you saw on the closure it allows it
to<00:05:14.030> withstand<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:15.169> little<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.530> more<00:05:15.860> but<00:05:16.610> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
to withstand a little bit more but it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.010 
to withstand a little bit more but it
had<00:05:16.940> no<00:05:17.060> guards<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.450> have<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.630> be<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.780> little<00:05:17.930> bit

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
had no guards to have to be a little bit

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.510 
had no guards to have to be a little bit
more<00:05:18.260> delicate<00:05:18.650> with<00:05:18.800> my<00:05:18.830> closure<00:05:19.130> make<00:05:19.430> sure

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
more delicate with my closure make sure

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.250

little<00:05:24.530> bit<00:05:24.680> more<00:05:24.800> delicate<00:05:25.430> when<00:05:25.640> you're

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
little bit more delicate when you're

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.540 
little bit more delicate when you're
sewing<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.210> on<00:05:26.419> it<00:05:26.930> might<00:05:27.500> decrease<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.100> life

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
sewing it on it might decrease the life

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.120 
sewing it on it might decrease the life
of<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.150> closure<00:05:29.390> if<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.169> doesn't<00:05:30.440> have<00:05:30.710> guards

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
of the closure if it doesn't have guards

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.540 
of the closure if it doesn't have guards

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
how it looks so my closure was perfect

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.719 
how it looks so my closure was perfect
for<00:05:47.240> me<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:47.600> wasn't<00:05:47.840> too<00:05:48.260> dense<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.890> it<00:05:49.400> wasn't

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
for me it wasn't too dense and it wasn't

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.100 
for me it wasn't too dense and it wasn't
too<00:05:49.850> thin<00:05:50.120> because<00:05:50.270> i<00:05:50.479> don't<00:05:50.780> like<00:05:50.960> those

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
too thin because i don't like those

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.890 
too thin because i don't like those
thick<00:05:51.620> thick<00:05:51.950> closures<00:05:52.640> that<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.510> can't<00:05:53.750> even

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
thick thick closures that you can't even

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.390 
thick thick closures that you can't even
really<00:05:54.200> see<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.530> part<00:05:54.770> in<00:05:54.890> it<00:05:55.010> and<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.220> don't

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
really see the part in it and I don't

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.070 
really see the part in it and I don't
like<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.640> to<00:05:55.760> be<00:05:55.850> too<00:05:56.060> thin<00:05:56.330> where<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.690> laces

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
like it to be too thin where the laces

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.300 
like it to be too thin where the laces
will<00:05:57.169> expose<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.740> everything<00:05:58.010> like<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.160> so

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
will expose and everything like that so

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.850 
will expose and everything like that so
my<00:05:58.610> closure<00:05:58.850> was<00:05:59.660> just<00:06:00.020> fine<00:06:00.229> for<00:06:00.470> me<00:06:00.650> I

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860

here<00:06:03.740> in<00:06:03.890> the<00:06:04.010> front<00:06:04.160> of<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.460> closure<00:06:04.700> and<00:06:05.710> at

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
here in the front of the closure and at

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.529 
here in the front of the closure and at
first<00:06:07.070> I<00:06:07.340> had<00:06:07.490> put<00:06:07.669> concealer<00:06:07.970> on<00:06:08.210> it<00:06:08.360> but<00:06:08.450> then

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539

I<00:06:08.600> wash<00:06:08.810> it<00:06:08.960> out<00:06:09.050> because<00:06:09.110> I<00:06:09.380> felt<00:06:09.560> like

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
I wash it out because I felt like

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.090 
I wash it out because I felt like
concealer<00:06:10.220> looked<00:06:10.430> weird<00:06:10.729> in<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.890> on<00:06:12.890> the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
concealer looked weird in the on the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.820 
concealer looked weird in the on the
lace<00:06:13.280> so<00:06:13.820> overall<00:06:14.300> I'm<00:06:14.539> very<00:06:14.570> very<00:06:15.169> happy<00:06:15.320> with
