her<00:00:40.320> shoes<00:00:40.590> off<00:00:40.740> so<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> we're<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
her shoes off so that we're about the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
her shoes off so that we're about the
same<00:00:41.910> height<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.050> in

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
same height because we're going to be in

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
same height because we're going to be in
the<00:00:43.230> same<00:00:43.380> photo<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.130> what<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.970> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the same photo because what I want to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
the same photo because what I want to
talk<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.810> today<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> inverse

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
talk to you about today is the inverse

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
talk to you about today is the inverse
square<00:00:47.940> law<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> light<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:48.989> turn<00:00:49.290> off<00:00:49.470> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
square law of light don't turn off I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.869 
square law of light don't turn off I
know<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.190> sounds<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.640> complicated

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
know that sounds really complicated

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
know that sounds really complicated
sounds<00:00:51.540> like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> load<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> physics<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
sounds like a load of physics and the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.940 
sounds like a load of physics and the
reason<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.000> sounds<00:00:54.270> complicated<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:55.140> because

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
reason it sounds complicated is because

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.020 
reason it sounds complicated is because
my<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.220> suppose<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.760> bit

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
my I suppose it is a little bit

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.460 
my I suppose it is a little bit
complicated<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.900> I'm<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
complicated but I'm going to make it

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.080 
complicated but I'm going to make it
really<00:00:58.949> simple<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.850> make<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
really simple and I'm going to make it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
really simple and I'm going to make it
simple<00:01:00.720> just<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.650> photographers<00:01:02.309> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
simple just for photographers because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
simple just for photographers because
the<00:01:03.030> biggest<00:01:03.480> problem<00:01:03.840> I've<00:01:03.960> seen<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.410> all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the biggest problem I've seen with all

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440 
the biggest problem I've seen with all
the<00:01:04.949> demonstrations<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.760> explanations

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the demonstrations and explanations

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
the demonstrations and explanations
about<00:01:06.600> inverse<00:01:07.080> square<00:01:07.410> law<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.830> start

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
about inverse square law as they start

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.950 
about inverse square law as they start
introducing<00:01:08.430> mathematics<00:01:09.300> they<00:01:09.690> start

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
introducing mathematics they start

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480 
introducing mathematics they start
introducing<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.590> other<00:01:10.890> formulas<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
introducing all these other formulas and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.490 
introducing all these other formulas and
things<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.300> I'm<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.110> give<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.380> as

things which I'm going to give you as

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
things which I'm going to give you as
well<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.009> I'm<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.160> going<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.430> give<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well but I'm just going to give you the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
well but I'm just going to give you the
important<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.660> first<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.229> what's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
important bit first about what's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.609 
important bit first about what's
important<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> photographers<00:01:18.450> okay<00:01:19.110> right

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
important to photographers okay right

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.680 
important to photographers okay right
now<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> light<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.910> there<00:01:21.240> there's

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
now we have a light it's there there's

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.130 
now we have a light it's there there's
the<00:01:21.869> light<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> shining<00:01:22.410> on<00:01:22.950> Sophie<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.670> also

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
the light is shining on Sophie it's also

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.359 
the light is shining on Sophie it's also
shining<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.420> move<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> light

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
shining on me now if we move that light

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
shining on me now if we move that light
something<00:01:29.369> dramatic<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.509> happen<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.200> we

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
something dramatic will happen if we

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.430 
something dramatic will happen if we
keep<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.369> exposure<00:01:32.759> correct<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.450> us<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
keep the exposure correct on us the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.350 
keep the exposure correct on us the
difference<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> exposure<00:01:35.430> between<00:01:35.759> Sophie

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
difference in exposure between Sophie

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.930 
difference in exposure between Sophie
and<00:01:36.570> me<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:37.289> change<00:01:37.670> dramatically<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
and me will change dramatically and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.240 
and me will change dramatically and
that's<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.260> know<00:01:40.440> so<00:01:40.770> basically

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that's all you need to know so basically

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.250 
that's all you need to know so basically
the<00:01:41.549> simple<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> light<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
the simple thing is when that light is

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.100 
the simple thing is when that light is
close<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.860> us<00:01:44.030> she<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> correctly<00:01:45.750> exposed

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
close to us she can be correctly exposed

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
close to us she can be correctly exposed
and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.830> be<00:01:46.950> underexposed<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.180> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and I will be underexposed but when that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
and I will be underexposed but when that
light<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> far<00:01:48.990> away<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.320> us<00:01:49.740> she<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.310> be

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
light is far away from us she will be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
light is far away from us she will be
correctly<00:01:50.820> exposed<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:52.140> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
correctly exposed and I will be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
correctly exposed and I will be

your<00:02:04.290> lighting<00:02:04.799> ratio<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.400> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.670> all

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
your lighting ratio is going to be all

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 
your lighting ratio is going to be all
over<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.600> shop<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> move<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.100> light

further away the fall-off of light the
power<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.370> light<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.970> fairly<00:02:12.540> similar<00:02:13.519> between

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
light is far away let's prove that and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.660 
light is far away let's prove that and
let's<00:02:18.900> film<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.579> it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
let's film it for you you can see it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030 
let's film it for you you can see it
change<00:02:21.000> we'll<00:02:21.329> take<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.600> photos<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.200> well<00:02:22.350> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
what's happening and she's also going to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
what's happening and she's also going to
take<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> picture<00:02:35.549> we've<00:02:36.090> got<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
take a picture we've got a little bit of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.970 
take a picture we've got a little bit of
light<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.079> her<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.470> that's<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.739> going<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:37.890> be

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
light on her but that's not going to be

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.380 
light on her but that's not going to be
used<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> picture<00:02:38.700> we've<00:02:39.060> got<00:02:39.209> some

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
used for the picture we've got some

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.080 
used for the picture we've got some
blackouts<00:02:39.959> here<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.070> stop<00:02:41.340> any<00:02:41.549> light

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
blackouts here just to stop any light

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.300 
blackouts here just to stop any light
bouncing<00:02:42.750> off<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:44.070> white

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

bouncing off of this and this white
ceiling<00:02:44.760> above<00:02:44.940> isn't<00:02:45.329> ideal<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.079> at

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
ceiling above isn't ideal for this at

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.000 
ceiling above isn't ideal for this at
the<00:02:46.320> moment<00:02:46.620> but

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the moment but

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.990 
the moment but
doesn't<00:02:47.189> really<00:02:47.280> matter<00:02:47.459> you'll<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:47.879> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
doesn't really matter you'll get the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030 
doesn't really matter you'll get the
idea<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.870> Fabian<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.409> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> film<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
idea so Fabian is going to film it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.009 
idea so Fabian is going to film it
phobias<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.819> take<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> still<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> we

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
phobias going to take a still so that we

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.520 
phobias going to take a still so that we
can<00:02:52.200> compare<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.340> these<00:02:53.549> things

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
can compare all of these things

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.750 
can compare all of these things
afterwards<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> end<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.579> see

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
afterwards at the end and you can see

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.339 
afterwards at the end and you can see
exactly<00:02:56.909> what<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> inverse-square<00:02:57.780> law

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
exactly what the inverse-square law

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.500 
exactly what the inverse-square law
means<00:02:59.129> okay<00:02:59.939> Ferb<00:03:00.239> let's<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.110> going<00:03:02.269> love<00:03:03.269> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
means okay Ferb let's get going love to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.530 
means okay Ferb let's get going love to
wait<00:03:03.870> for<00:03:04.049> Tim<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.379> move<00:03:05.120> okay<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.180> what<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
wait for Tim to move okay so what you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.369 
wait for Tim to move okay so what you
should<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:08.750> Sophie<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.049> correct

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
should see now is Sophie is the correct

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.619 
should see now is Sophie is the correct
exposure<00:03:10.739> here<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.700> Fabian<00:03:12.150> has<00:03:12.269> set<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
exposure here because Fabian has set the

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.690 
exposure here because Fabian has set the
correct<00:03:12.840> exposure<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.739> camera<00:03:14.250> for

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
correct exposure on that camera for

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.420 
correct exposure on that camera for
Sophie<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.840> should<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.430> considerably

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
Sophie and I should be considerably

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.390 
Sophie and I should be considerably
darker<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.329> exposure<00:03:18.720> than<00:03:19.230> Sophie<00:03:19.769> because

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
darker in exposure than Sophie because

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.460 
darker in exposure than Sophie because
of<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.640> inverse<00:03:20.970> square<00:03:21.120> law<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.720> light<00:03:21.900> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
of the inverse square law of light so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.740 
of the inverse square law of light so
basically<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.040> fall-off<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.609> light<00:03:23.970> falls

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
basically the fall-off of light falls

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.680 
basically the fall-off of light falls
off<00:03:24.959> quicker<00:03:25.290> because<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.980> light<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.690> closer

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
off quicker because the light is closer

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.440 
off quicker because the light is closer
now<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.950> move<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:29.370> light<00:03:29.639> further<00:03:30.000> away

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
now as we move this light further away

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.080 
now as we move this light further away
then<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.739> difference<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.430> exposure<00:03:32.760> between

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
then the difference in exposure between

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.860 
then the difference in exposure between
us<00:03:33.480> will<00:03:33.989> become<00:03:34.650> more<00:03:34.980> similar<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:35.870> Fabian

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
us will become more similar as Fabian

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.649 
us will become more similar as Fabian
adjust<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.319> exposure<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:38.220> suit<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:38.909> Sophie

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
adjust the exposure to suit for Sophie

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.629 
adjust the exposure to suit for Sophie
so<00:03:40.109> let's<00:03:40.290> take<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> photo<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:41.069> me<00:03:41.340> please

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
so let's take a photo of me please

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.979 
so let's take a photo of me please
Fabian<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.389> Sophie<00:03:43.049> together<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.540> good

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
Fabian and Sophie together just so good

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.300 
Fabian and Sophie together just so good
so<00:03:46.170> we've<00:03:46.290> got<00:03:46.379> one<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.739> record<00:03:47.069> there

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
so we've got one for the record there

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.580 
so we've got one for the record there
and<00:03:47.579> then<00:03:48.000> Tim<00:03:48.359> is<00:03:48.659> now<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.470> start

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and then Tim is now going to start

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.589 
and then Tim is now going to start
moving<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.549> light<00:03:50.730> away<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.150> Fabian<00:03:51.540> is

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
moving the light away and Fabian is

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.530 
moving the light away and Fabian is
going<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> try<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.109> adjust<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.650> exposure<00:03:53.069> as

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
going to try and adjust the exposure as

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.170 
going to try and adjust the exposure as
he<00:03:54.540> does<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.199> films<00:03:56.040> Tim's<00:03:56.760> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.000> take

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
he does it and films Tim's going to take

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.920 
he does it and films Tim's going to take
that<00:03:57.359> light<00:03:57.599> far<00:03:58.049> far<00:03:58.379> away<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.069> as<00:03:59.849> he<00:04:00.690> moves

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that light far far away and as he moves

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.650 
that light far far away and as he moves
that<00:04:01.109> light<00:04:01.319> further<00:04:01.739> away<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:03.000> difference

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
that light further away the difference

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.199 
that light further away the difference
in<00:04:03.930> light<00:04:04.199> between<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.949> two<00:04:05.129> of<00:04:05.310> us<00:04:05.459> will

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
in light between the two of us will

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.599 
in light between the two of us will
become<00:04:06.359> closer<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.230> we<00:04:07.260> will<00:04:07.500> basically<00:04:08.129> end

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
become closer so we will basically end

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.939 
become closer so we will basically end
up<00:04:08.819> as<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.030> same<00:04:09.510> exposure<00:04:10.139> when<00:04:10.470> Fabian

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
up as the same exposure when Fabian

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.900 
up as the same exposure when Fabian
adjusts<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:12.030> brightness<00:04:12.209> level<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:13.109> suit<00:04:13.410> and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
adjusts the brightness level to suit and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.539 
adjusts the brightness level to suit and
he's<00:04:14.910> keeping<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.480> light<00:04:15.660> pointing<00:04:16.139> at<00:04:16.289> us

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
he's keeping that light pointing at us

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.890 
he's keeping that light pointing at us
Fabian<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.639> trying<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.970> keep<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.359> with<00:04:18.389> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
Fabian is trying to keep up with the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.129 
Fabian is trying to keep up with the
exposure<00:04:19.349> as<00:04:19.709> he<00:04:19.859> goes<00:04:20.099> there<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.139> hopefully

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
exposure as he goes there and hopefully

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.200 
exposure as he goes there and hopefully
she<00:04:22.440> will<00:04:22.740> end<00:04:23.039> up<00:04:23.250> at<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> point<00:04:23.729> where<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
she will end up at a point where the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.770 
she will end up at a point where the
exposure<00:04:24.599> is<00:04:24.870> correct<00:04:25.289> for<00:04:25.729> Sophie<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.000> if

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
exposure is correct for Sophie and if

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.810 
exposure is correct for Sophie and if
you<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.349> tell<00:04:28.620> me<00:04:28.770> when<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.340> true

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
you can tell me when that is true

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.760 
you can tell me when that is true
so<00:04:30.300> Fabian<00:04:30.750> saying<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.199> exposure<00:04:31.530> is

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
so Fabian saying that the exposure is

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.860 
so Fabian saying that the exposure is
correct<00:04:32.099> for<00:04:32.220> Sophie<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.849> if<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
correct for Sophie and if it is the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.230 
correct for Sophie and if it is the
exposure<00:04:34.229> now<00:04:34.680> should<00:04:35.370> look<00:04:35.580> pretty<00:04:35.610> good<00:04:36.090> on

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
exposure now should look pretty good on

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
exposure now should look pretty good on
me<00:04:36.630> too<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.380> if<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.560> want<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.830> take<00:04:38.010> another

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
me too so if you want to take another

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.050 
me too so if you want to take another
photo<00:04:38.430> please<00:04:39.090> fab<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:41.490> should<00:04:41.699> now<00:04:42.030> have

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
photo please fab and we should now have

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.529 
photo please fab and we should now have
a<00:04:42.510> photo<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:44.070> bit<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.310> video<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.909> shows

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
a photo and a bit of video that shows

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.589 
a photo and a bit of video that shows
that<00:04:46.530> Sophie<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.699> are<00:04:47.970> at<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.330> same

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
that Sophie and I are at the same

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.310 
that Sophie and I are at the same
exposure<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.380> Tim<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.940> now<00:04:51.150> see<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
exposure and Tim can now see that this

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.589 
exposure and Tim can now see that this
light<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.860> long<00:04:53.310> way<00:04:53.699> away<00:04:53.729> Tim's<00:04:54.360> got<00:04:54.539> to

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
light is a long way away Tim's got to

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.839 
light is a long way away Tim's got to
take<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:54.930> camera<00:04:55.440> off<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> tripod<00:04:56.070> this

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
take that camera off the tripod this

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.999 
take that camera off the tripod this
light<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.750> long<00:04:58.139> long<00:04:58.440> long<00:04:58.650> way<00:04:58.710> away<00:04:58.889> from

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
light is a long long long way away from

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.219 
light is a long long long way away from
all<00:05:00.129> the<00:05:00.309> way<00:05:00.430> over<00:05:00.460> here<00:05:00.849> from<00:05:01.629> where<00:05:01.839> we<00:05:02.050> were

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
all the way over here from where we were

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.879 
all the way over here from where we were
with<00:05:03.039> Sophie<00:05:03.909> before<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:04.930> that<00:05:05.139> is<00:05:05.349> basically

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
with Sophie before so that is basically

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.489 
with Sophie before so that is basically
in<00:05:06.069> the<00:05:06.249> square<00:05:06.639> law<00:05:06.819> of<00:05:06.999> light<00:05:07.199> and<00:05:08.199> what<00:05:08.319> that

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:08.499 
in the square law of light and what that

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:10.290 
in the square law of light and what that
tells<00:05:08.680> us<00:05:08.949> that<00:05:09.460> is<00:05:09.610> if<00:05:09.819> your<00:05:10.029> light<00:05:10.270> is

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
tells us that is if your light is

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.010 
tells us that is if your light is
further<00:05:10.809> away<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.649> fall-off<00:05:12.189> of<00:05:12.219> light<00:05:12.580> is

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
further away the fall-off of light is

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.929 
further away the fall-off of light is
less<00:05:14.639> intense

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
less intense

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.730 
less intense
so<00:05:16.089> therefore<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.539> exposure<00:05:16.899> of<00:05:17.139> two<00:05:17.289> objects

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
so therefore the exposure of two objects

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.159 
so therefore the exposure of two objects
side<00:05:17.860> by<00:05:18.039> side<00:05:18.339> will<00:05:18.789> be<00:05:18.909> fairly<00:05:19.240> similar<00:05:19.659> this

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
side by side will be fairly similar this

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.019 
side by side will be fairly similar this
is<00:05:20.379> very<00:05:20.649> important<00:05:21.249> if<00:05:21.369> you're<00:05:21.490> doing<00:05:21.520> group

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
is very important if you're doing group

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.719 
is very important if you're doing group
shots<00:05:22.389> couple<00:05:23.259> of<00:05:23.349> models<00:05:23.649> together<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.279> that

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
shots couple of models together is that

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.969 
shots couple of models together is that
ratio<00:05:25.149> of<00:05:25.509> like<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:25.809> contrast<00:05:26.139> of<00:05:26.649> like<00:05:26.830> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
ratio of like that contrast of like the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.859 
ratio of like that contrast of like the
difference<00:05:27.490> between<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:28.089> two<00:05:28.300> when<00:05:28.719> you're

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:28.869 
difference between the two when you're

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.170 
difference between the two when you're
using<00:05:29.139> a<00:05:29.319> single<00:05:29.740> light<00:05:29.949> you<00:05:30.460> can<00:05:30.669> control

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
using a single light you can control

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.059 
using a single light you can control
that<00:05:31.419> better<00:05:31.659> by<00:05:32.080> moving<00:05:32.319> your<00:05:32.499> light<00:05:32.830> a

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
that better by moving your light a

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.540 
that better by moving your light a
further<00:05:33.639> distance<00:05:34.860> tune<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:36.039> next<00:05:36.249> week<00:05:36.520> for

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
further distance tune in next week for

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.969 
further distance tune in next week for
part<00:05:36.759> two<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.509> see<00:05:37.689> another<00:05:38.050> very<00:05:38.439> important

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
part two to see another very important
