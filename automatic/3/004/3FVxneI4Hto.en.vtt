13<00:00:21.490> 24<00:00:22.560> 24<00:00:23.560> I<00:00:32.100> want<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.249> to<00:00:33.339> understand<00:00:33.850> that

13 24 24 I want you to understand that

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:37.020 
13 24 24 I want you to understand that
you<00:00:34.719> need<00:00:34.899> to<00:00:35.170> always<00:00:35.859> be<00:00:36.309> thinking<00:00:36.489> about<00:00:36.760> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
you need to always be thinking about the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.919 
you need to always be thinking about the
one<00:00:37.300> finger<00:00:38.079> per<00:00:38.109> fret<00:00:38.320> rule<00:00:38.829> with<00:00:39.159> guitar<00:00:39.550> and

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
one finger per fret rule with guitar and

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.479 
one finger per fret rule with guitar and
so<00:00:40.929> the<00:00:41.350> reason<00:00:41.559> I'm<00:00:41.769> starting<00:00:42.190> with<00:00:42.309> my

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
so the reason I'm starting with my

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.239 
so the reason I'm starting with my
second<00:00:42.909> finger<00:00:43.120> on<00:00:43.510> this<00:00:44.320> pattern<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:44.920> because

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
second finger on this pattern is because

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.860 
second finger on this pattern is because
on<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> next<00:00:45.670> string<00:00:45.819> over<00:00:46.120> i<00:00:46.149> need<00:00:46.449> my<00:00:46.629> first

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
on the next string over i need my first

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.430 
on the next string over i need my first
finger<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:48.219> one<00:00:48.519> fret<00:00:48.819> ok<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:49.960> if<00:00:50.050> i<00:00:50.170> were<00:00:50.319> to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
finger back one fret ok so if i were to

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.139 
finger back one fret ok so if i were to
start<00:00:50.679> with<00:00:50.859> my<00:00:51.010> first<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.550> third<00:00:51.729> finger

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149

sudden you have to jump your first

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.759 
sudden you have to jump your first
finger<00:00:57.969> back<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.600> what<00:00:59.170> if<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.350> go<00:00:59.440> too<00:00:59.589> far

start<00:01:05.110> here<00:01:05.259> with<00:01:05.290> two<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:14.680> with<00:01:15.310> any<00:01:15.340> scale

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
start here with two as with any scale

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.580 
start here with two as with any scale
pattern<00:01:16.299> a<00:01:16.450> lot<00:01:16.689> of<00:01:16.810> times<00:01:16.990> it's<00:01:17.170> very<00:01:17.229> helpful

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
pattern a lot of times it's very helpful

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.560 
pattern a lot of times it's very helpful
to<00:01:17.829> break<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:18.909> down<00:01:19.090> into<00:01:19.450> little<00:01:19.570> pieces<00:01:19.899> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
to break it down into little pieces and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:35.429 
to break it down into little pieces and
just<00:01:22.570> practice<00:01:23.020> those<00:01:23.500> little<00:01:23.770> pieces<00:01:34.439> break

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
just practice those little pieces break

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.649 
just practice those little pieces break
the<00:01:35.619> full-scale<00:01:36.039> don't<00:01:36.369> like<00:01:36.549> this<00:01:36.729> on<00:01:37.420> each

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
the full-scale don't like this on each

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:55.730 
the full-scale don't like this on each
pair<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.710> strengths<00:01:39.280> individually

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130 

and<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.330> should<00:01:58.360> take<00:01:58.720> this<00:01:58.870> scale

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and also you should take this scale

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.630 
and also you should take this scale
pattern<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.770> as<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.070> did<00:02:00.220> with<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.400> main

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
pattern and as we did with the main

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.700 
pattern and as we did with the main
pattern<00:02:00.910> move<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.780> down<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.170> first<00:02:02.440> route

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
pattern move it down to the first route

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.040 
pattern move it down to the first route
or<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.920> second<00:02:03.340> fret<00:02:03.580> just<00:02:04.360> start<00:02:04.600> playing<00:02:04.750> it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050
