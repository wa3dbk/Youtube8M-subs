00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.980
 the main of this exhibition on French should be this 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.799
 history of impressionism showing that along the Seine 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.519
 this tool will reflect 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.519
 worse than it pays 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.180
 1 and what happened to a lot of things what do you think 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.860
 ten years ago that is one of the most powerful 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.560
 65% distance 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 via paintings that are birth certificates without really appreciating the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.550
 for example the state of the data processed by in particular by the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.450
 Orsay Museum 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.530
 which are particularly important 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.710
 there are also some paintings that will be interesting because precisely they 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 are less severe in the lovers included 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 for 100 which is the only one 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 m particular collections and that has not been exposed since a lot of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.620
 time since the big exhibition what is your comment 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.320
 so cayouette is a lure and a very special personality in 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.739
 the history of impressionism 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.720
 he is best known for being like a great collector it was 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.439
 he was a great collector 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.170
 before he was more financially favored than his younger years 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.330
 after disaster 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.150
 and so he was able to gather every summer for a very very beautiful 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 collection of paintings of monet renoir pissarro sisley total apatow all 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.470
 all his older friends he accumulates that him 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.390
 % ytd the answer brings us this is very beautiful collection 10 in addition he has 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.740
 given to the state he died relatively early and percent and he has 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 given this collection the condition provided it is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 exposed it be part of the winged national collections exposed why 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 it was a big big big scandal the post a notice which vote and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.399
 after the arrival of the impressionists to the collections 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.790
 national is also a great painter 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.670
 if it takes place a very particular personality within two groups 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.780
 Impressionist 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.340
 which I would even say a limit not marie-mai for aulnoye 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.610
 if these differences include a piece of skin and is interested 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.610
 enormously the photograph such tax 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 and it feels in this room this time so a kind of realism 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.220
 photographic enough surprising the details of the reflections she interprets 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.730
 do not detail taxes it's a record of the periods the sleeve on 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.090
 realizes that there is a quite appreciable technique that is someone who 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.700
 is who does not look like anyone else and it's always me it's 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 always interesting firefighters 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:30.290
 excessively during this period the oldest house is 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.299
 true that everyone played his role obviously renoir played his role 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.109
 also 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.139
 but but I think so but especially bringing in 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.730
 stomach Zionism is that it's just somehow 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.340
 be it for many years 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.860
 for not having to baptized finally at last in quotation marks - 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.799
 pictorial 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.599
 mÃ©nez is as important only percent as father of 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.590
 Impressionism 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.669
 but what is quite exceptional about him is that 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.289
 then he becomes one of the greatest French painters of the 20th century 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.299
 that a job around this business 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.290
 at giverny 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.380
 and it's really someone who who quits twice in a row he innovates 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.380
 exceptional ways in themselves 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.779
 interest 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.169
 this is the main of this exhibition I thought of your iron this story 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.109
 of impressionism by showing details that his nerves also of 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.029
 much less well known tables and pan yet small folds in general and 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.660
 neighborhoods of skirmishes is meant to be didactic for example 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.829
 the total neighborhood of works it's a little later to 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.589
 did not spare 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:38.579
 yeah there obviously by chance% and choosing a painting from a harbor view of 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.539
 lead little guys of 74 which is not the pressure rising sun but that's all 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.919
 in fact in the tradition of the place at the rising sun and just said 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.359
 wagering cork have finally brought back in a few occasions the voice 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.519
 percentage is interesting too 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.430
 I also wanted to finish with an opening on the 20th century with 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.480
 paintings by matisse de vlaminck showing that the scene is still relevant 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.779
 and which shows above all this scoop to bring this revolution of impressionism 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.159
 in europe philips that started in the 60s
