00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 because I go but they combine 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.929
 really just not that idea 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 found that in a hundred years as 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.770
 the founder of the company 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 a hundred years ago in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.040
 heino a supermarket or grocer and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 nowadays supermarket man does not crawl 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 at the grocery store that sold or seeds 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 and those seeds returned to animals 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.730
 given as food 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 where is it then comes in sidi 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.239
 there was more and more going 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 sell hands and that ran 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 actually very good then 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.719
 here in Alkmaar 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 bought a piece of land from an old one 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 newspaper from a nursery and has one here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 cupboard where it still is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 a profession namely pet supplies 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 combine with plants actually are 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.439
 both two parts are in 25 years 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.439
 Time grew until it had been fishing 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
 an industry that prefers a market- based foundation 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 After that you had to use the garden industry 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 Earth is happening so much fun 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.700
 new developments are here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.590
 for example at the animal part 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 and you see that the house is always here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 less part of the family 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.860
 That means we receive nutrition 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 scan about nutrition as we ourselves 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.100
 we want to spoil ourselves with our animals 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.210
 so spoil your own snacks 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 cookies 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.049
 even order the beer for that matter so you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.579
 can join as part of the family 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.750
 can celebrate if we still have something special 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.490
 but we also see very new ones 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.159
 developments related to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.530
 your lap sports that are really needed 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.310
 have to wear a jacket when 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.259
 it is cold 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.570
 its the kind of dog food how know 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.399
 you know what food for your help and best 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 is what we humans are for that matter 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.520
 not everything as if as animals have on 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.500
 our front can find the one sprouts 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 neck and other carrots neck it so 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.710
 it is actually also with animals 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.240
 they have sometimes a certain 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.020
 notes there are certain taste pattern 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.399
 in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 and they are used to it so that is possible 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.420
 sometimes feature differences but whatever 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.099
 very important is that just like us 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 people sometimes have skin problems such as 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.269
 the dog on freight issues you have one 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.040
 a different diet than when 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.290
 for example, you have stomach problems 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 so everywhere for that matter there are 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.440
 different food but also in which 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 phase of life we ​​are human too 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.890

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.000

 Every stage you have your own 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.780
 diet matched to the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 stage of life of the dog or a cat 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.750
