00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 not 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.180
 sir liger you are breeders in 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.869
 which departments you have the 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.910
 natural meadows 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.639
 yes 123 hectares and how is it 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.000
 wears not too well moles 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.320
 the wild boars the field mice you have 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.689
 heard about the degeneration of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.759
 grasslands what are you doing for 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.109
 fight if there was a way for 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.570
 to do it one would get to do whatever 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.429
 thing but it's not obvious then that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.680
 sir liger a lot of breeders 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.290
 ignore that it is possible to regenerate 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.030
 grasslands with adapted means of 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.350
 like harrow we offer you 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.750
 to meet the gentleman 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.030
 martin who is responsible france at 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.770
 ngok and who will talk to us about the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.540
 prairie regeneration technique 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.070
 jean frédéric martin you talk about 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.510
 grassland regeneration that means 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.400
 that our prairies auvergnate they are 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.080
 and generate yes in part 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.720
 we see it is grassland in fact 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.100
 natural and then over time actually 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.140
 it's meadows that have deteriorated 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.510
 while we see some breeders 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.910
 actually who every two years all 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.710
 the five melted on semi had in 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.210
 makes a return potential in value 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.369
 far greater than 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.659
 neighbors then under what effect the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.609
 meadows are degrading tel 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.229
 today we are confronted with 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.520
 modern machines so we make some 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.859
 layers of cuts more and more 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 early it means that when there is a 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.600
 twenty years have gathered the end 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.039
 around the 20th of July, 15th of July 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.499
 today we do wrapping so 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.119
 we make cuts from May 15 and 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.510
 so we no longer have the natural cycle where 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.370
 actually the seeds do not fall 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.810
 in fact air and regenerates the meadow 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.270
 naturally what is the difference 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.680
 between heavy regeneration and a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.000
 gentle regeneration 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
 so today actually there are two 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 so thirsty systems and a regeneration 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 total it means we return the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 existing meadows 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 so this is called a 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.970
 quite direct enough heavy generation and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 otherwise we have a barely or a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 regeneration actually sweet so that wants 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.900
 to say that we do not return to attack 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 there the meadow and we actually do that 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.020
 which is called the technique is simple 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.670
 on semi so what is the principle of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 operation of a weeder harrow 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.350
 device that comes the culture in fact of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 cereals contributed a lot in organic but 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.890
 that we also use in polyculture 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.720
 breeding for grassland maintenance and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.180
 in fact it's a machine that has 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.070
 teeth that works so vibrating who 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.360
 scratch the surface and when it is 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.460
 therefore combines with a pneumatic seeder 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 we can actually do this but at the same time 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.270
 regenerate the meadow at the relay in 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.820
 what effect do they produce at the level of 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.560
 soil and rootlets then the teeth in 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.290
 themselves they did a function 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.990
 vibrating so she scrapes the surface and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.100
 create a little seedbed and when 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.930
 we are indeed we love each other 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
 directly with the seeder with a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.670
 sparkle we get to surface 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.350
 and it's actually touching grain 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.209
 soil that we actually arrive at 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.709
 put back a cover then in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.510
 function of years according to the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.500
 weather in dry conditions sometimes 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.890
 have to roll back by 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.870
 behind 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.220
 but what is important is the base 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.930
 this is actually when doing 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.459
 sweet regeneration it's really 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.470
 to adapt the types of seeds by 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.610
 compared to the type of soil in general the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 Germans Germans Austrians 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 the Scandinavians them actually they have a 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.150
 productivity per hectare which is 30 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.800
 40% higher that they avoid 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.780
 to buy inputs like oilcake 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.010
 of soy and others and in fact they have a 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.330
 annuity for life of the economy largely 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.459
 superior to what is known in France 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.069
 and in France the approach was everything 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.959
 just did that reap 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.269
 hay whereas in these countries 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.310
 cultivate the bottom we cultivate it so 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.829
 naturally we do not come in a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.569
 intensive system by putting in more 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.310
 fertilizer not because when we do 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.530
 on semi agyeman different types of 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.689
 belier that we actually add by 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.400
 example of clover clover in all directions 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.069
 naturally gives it's actually 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.319
 a fertilizer and that actually gives back 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.209
 in fact a blow tifos at the level of the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.909
 meadow what are the criteria of choice 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.849
 of a harrow then everything depends on the 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.719
 type of grazing we have if we can 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.909
 easily access 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.680
 so we sell small machines 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.389
 widths ranging from doctors when for 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.730
 mountainous areas like deezer and 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:00.060
 others and in fact there is a little more 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
 surface on varies from 6 m to 12 meters in 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.129
 working width 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 Can you give us a 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.699
 price order of the machine the most 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.799
 sold there in six meters for example 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:11.340
 so here it is an average price of 4200 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.530
 euros excluding taxes and the integrated seeder to 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.579
 the harrow weeping then agglo marc so 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.759
 it's an option to see each other 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.530
 pneumatic so we're actually at 8400 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.419
 euros for the complete machine 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.099
 a word about profitability and return 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.090
 on investment is it's a 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.919
 good investment 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.509
 then the investment one can have 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.580
 actually did calculations 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.139
 how many 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.340
 how much is the budget of 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.990
 dietary supplements in the form of 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.300
 cakes compared to the surface 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.009
 actually we are exploiting this and in 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 did we have returns 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.659
 investments after the second 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.460
 year 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.229
 Is there still some 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.000
 popularization with breeders 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.039
 to do around this type of material 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.689
 so that's where it's actually 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.919
 all the work to do the breeders who 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.319
 know in general it's those who 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.060
 come from the bio because originally the 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.620
 weeder harrow was used in the bio 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.000
 today it is rather the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.979
 conventional who is a buyer of people 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.240
 of products and in the culture and 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.919
 the cows actually has the device 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.569
 which serves both for the maintenance of 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.440
 prairies is actually had to undo the 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.300
 mechanical weeding 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.979
 so is this a tool that I 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.400
 will also be able to value on my 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.560
 cultures 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.150
 yes absolutely and in fact this is where 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.319
 does the profitability it is maybe 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.509
 over two years is going to be brought back 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.069
 actually a year and today the 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.020
 in fact the Norman Grenelle 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.940
 say we reduce by 50% the two suites to 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.710
 we are problems of resistance to 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.539
 level of some weeds and 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.219
 the simple fact for example three days 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.439
 after sowing to do one and sort to 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.689
 Blind it is already liquidated in 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.599
 makes up to 50 60 % the pressure of the 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.250
 weeds in perennial names 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.250
 very well so this I am a breeder 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.590
 fashion is one who wants to produce more everything 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.539
 respecting the environment I buy 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.889
 a weeder harrow in clear yes and then 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.449
 especially there is an economic profitability 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.310
 at the exit because the nerve of war 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.440
 actually it's not to do there 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.629
 necessarily the race for the hectares is 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.860
 to produce the maximum in autonomy and 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.599
 to have a profitability is 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.770
 actually have a standard of living and 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.259
 a correct income 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.469
 sir martin thank you I you 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.469
 please
