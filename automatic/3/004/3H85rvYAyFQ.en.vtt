00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.250
 this reinforcement strategy to order yes as you said all to 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 the time when you look at montpellier including cinematics 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.020
 the impression of watching to follow or how he gets to do that well 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.260
 we managed to find the society that was hiding behind the 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.110
 residence cinematics of these Japanese companies which will be called 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.400
 pressure for the contacted to tell you everything apart but they have 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 responded they agreed to provide us with images that frightened the franc 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.830
 had provided nobody really very very very few people we see all the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.710
 process is all setting up kinematic sequences of residence 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 blues should see how he manages to create his cine effects on the 6% and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.260
 the pictures the price that is worth the obvious legion of honor 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.090
 look at these pictures, according to you 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.500
 it's a replay of the enchanted carousel 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.570
 a parody of horror movie japanese etc frankly it tells you nothing and if 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 I add music 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.310
 m still nothing 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 and with the sound effects 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.770
 and here you are on the track 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.780
 This is the troop of residents t city number 2 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 the images you just saw are from the official making-off that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 we will find out 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
 together 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490
 we are here in the skies of the Japanese printing company 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.750
 creator of excellent cinematic sequence and resorb villedieu 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.590
 like for a movie and in a very classic way the work will start with the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 realization of a storyboard 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.820
 the printing teams then embarked on a task 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.580
 unusual shooting of all shots of cinematic sequences with 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.460
 real actors 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.700
 make no mistake 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 it is not yet a motion capture but a mini-film in 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.610
 video to clear the angles of view 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.890
 the coherence of the sequences 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.730
 future images 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.870
 then comes then the motion capture sequences to get some 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.870
 extremely realistic movements 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.449
 you recognize the famous white balls or who are sensors 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.269
 placed on the joints but which allow to transcribe the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.269
 computer movements 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.709
 of course this technique is not perfect and the images so capture 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.479
 must be absolutely rework 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.359
 it 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.359
 it 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.840
 at the end of the race to the audience where he does not in the neighborhood of 116 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:43.969
 roughly drawn 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.969
 if he calls besides the first tests on the man everyone 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.829
 the final result 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.980
 but the end result is precisely here once 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 questions asked music and sound effects 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 following if auxerre 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.730
 for those who have not understood everything but also the origin of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.730
 yahoo process 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.650
 outdoor wicked 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.650
 this tourist of mushroom access 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.079
 but the same job was done for you 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.150
 all the cinematic sequences featuring the characters 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.849
 so we understand better why the teams took six months to do 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.529
 both finals 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.239
 we are full of sight
