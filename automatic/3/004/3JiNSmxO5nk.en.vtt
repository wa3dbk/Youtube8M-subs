00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello today we'll learn how to do 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.370
 a cake towel cake towel cake 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.370
 shaggy will be very soft and quite the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.519
 get your recipe book and write down 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.519
 the ingredients 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.360
 and to start this cake we go 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.910
 butter the sugar and the yolks 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.150
 to beat the mixer until it 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.489
 very creamy cream whitened with cream 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.660
 butter already well creamy and cuddly 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.970
 time to start mixing the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.480
 liquid ingredients alternating with 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.480
 flour 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 now that the dough is already well homogeneous 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.530
 and with this texture I'm going to draw it 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.300
 another ball wash the mixer a lot 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 including well washed with a little 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.210
 hot water to beat the egg whites 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.159
 snow 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.020
 I'm washing her with plenty of water. 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.910
 with enough soap to take the whole 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.800
 final fat in snow will not 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.869
 stay at the point that I desire 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.270
 and finally we'll see this 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.390
 clear in snow along with the cake and with a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 little different so that bruno stays 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.470
 Quietly cute when you 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.619
 put it in the shape of a laugh as I did 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.509
 here in mine 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.340
 now it will stay 180 degrees for longer 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.020
 or less 40 minutes with the cake ready to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.360
 people need to do the coverage that is the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 that characterizes his towel name 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.280
 and the cover is nothing more than 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.280
 dried coconut grated condensed milk 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 milk 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.519
 milk in the body and leaves it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.410
 15 10 minutes to be able to treat and there 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.410
 then mix the condensed milk 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.379
 and so do the cake towel to the floor 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.379
 public 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.180
