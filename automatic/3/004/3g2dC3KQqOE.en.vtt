00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello friends, we are Jack and Geoff from Achievement Hunter.com. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.820
 Look, we're in the Fails of the Weak volume 5 on Friday! 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.660
 What's up with that? 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.100
 We change Fails of the Weak for Friday 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.540
 because we already have AHWU on Mondays. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.040
 This is Bentsquirrely ... 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.940
 He is ... That ... that ... 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 That Banshee looks very beaten 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.720
 and this guy steals it and then looks. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 It's like stealing a candy from a child. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.480
 You do not want to do that. 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.140
 This is ChaosEmerald2 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.760
 hitting a guy in the face, look at this. 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.680
 That's pretty cool! 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.480
 Ray! I would not like to be that guy. 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 This is CainVoorhees 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.820
 this is something difficult, then he exploits 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 but what happens, in fact it was a plasma grenade 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 that exploded near him and bounced. 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.020
 Watch this. 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.760
 This one fell because he killed the guy 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.860
 and made the grenade bounce. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.780
 It took me a while to discover it. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.520
 I have to see it again. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.680
 Did you see how it changed in the air? 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.380
 It's great. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.840
 It's sad. 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.940
 It is a fail. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.940
 This is Retribution 1337 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.820
 who saw the fail of someone, look at this. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.720
 What are you doing? 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.800
 It was like: "I could swear there was a trapdoor." 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.360
 I love the fails with rocket backpack. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.760
 And there are so many fails like that. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 "I have to return." 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.100
 How sad. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 It was the best. 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 This is SkormsGhost 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.040
 who was very lucky with the armor lock. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.440
 Use the armor lock and return the grenade 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.200
 and these guys ... 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.620
 Then what is that? 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.100
 It was a fail of them. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 But was it suicide? 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.040
 I think it was double death. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.800
 I think so. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.360
 This is Xevious 117 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 with another fail of rocket backpack. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.540
 We could do a series with only those fails. 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.580
 To the precipice. 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.960
 It seems that he hit his head and pushed him into the void. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.240
 He became disoriented. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.880
 It is the best! 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 I love that. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.620
 They should show it to the Spartans. 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.240
 This is KingKrush8 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 That makes an incredible jump. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.400
 What the hell is that? 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.360
 I have no idea. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.320
 In fact it is a good point. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.420
 A Spartan can fall from space ... 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 True 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.540
 He falls, gets up and says: "I'm fine" 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.400
 But they can drown in a puddle of water. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 That's crazy. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.740
 Do not let the Covenant discover it. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.320
 This is SuggZugg 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.100
 and it's just the beginning of a shooting game. 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.960
 I do not know if you saw it, but the bullet bounced on the floor 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.420
 in a duel of snipers. 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.580
 Or a game of Shooting with sniper. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.100
 And it went through his head. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.840
 That's... 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.160
 It is a bad calculation. 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.160
 It bounced on the floor ... 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.680
 I wonder if they eliminate him for treason. 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.980
 I guess so. 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.140
 He only walked 4 steps. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.820
 You imagine: "Let's do this ..." and kill him. 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.420
 This is Joshhhyyyy, this is ... 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.060
 Look at the type of white. 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.620
 I think the one in white is Joshhhyyyy, but look at this. 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.500
 He goes running and then they try to kill him ... 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 Then killed ... 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.920
 And in the end double death. 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 They killed each other. 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.320
 He is the luckiest guy. 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.100
 This is WinneBagel, it's the last of the week. 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.160
 It is a funny name. 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.180
 Throw a grenade 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.240
 and says: "I'll try again, see what happens." 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.280
 And roll towards his friend. 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
 For him to kill them. 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.580
 I loved. 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.520
 See you next Friday for more! 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.700
