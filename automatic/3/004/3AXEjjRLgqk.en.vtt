I've already did two this is one and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
I've already did two this is one and
then<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.539> did<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.170> back<00:00:22.789> right<00:00:23.789> here

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
then I did one in the back right here

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
then I did one in the back right here
and<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.920> bang

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and I'm gonna show you how I do my bang

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
and I'm gonna show you how I do my bang
area<00:00:26.730> um<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.720> me<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> most<00:00:28.349> important<00:00:28.830> area

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
area um to me is the most important area

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.099 
area um to me is the most important area
because<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.179> flow<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> certain<00:00:30.900> way

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
because I like it to flow a certain way

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.160 
because I like it to flow a certain way
so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.830> usually<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:33.149> bang<00:00:33.390> area<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.020> be

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so I usually like my bang area to be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
so I usually like my bang area to be
somewhat<00:00:34.739> feathered<00:00:35.190> reflect<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.750> like

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
somewhat feathered reflect kind of like

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
somewhat feathered reflect kind of like
that<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.140> way<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> keep<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.610> by

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that so a good way to keep that in is by

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
that so a good way to keep that in is by
pen<00:00:42.300> curling<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> show<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> how

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
pen curling so I'm going to show you how

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.529 
pen curling so I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.040> now

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
to do that right now

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.709 
to do that right now
it's<00:00:45.539> very<00:00:45.809> easy<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.090> very<00:00:48.090> comfortable

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to sleep on so I'm just going to show

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
to sleep on so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
you that right now so right now I'm just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
you that right now so right now I'm just
combing<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.170> flip<00:00:56.420> just<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
combing it out into a flip just how I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
combing it out into a flip just how I
had<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> curl<00:00:58.550> see<00:01:00.890> I'm<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.280> follow

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
had it curl see I'm just gonna follow

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.960 
had it curl see I'm just gonna follow
the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> curl<00:01:03.570> goes<00:01:04.700> using<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:05.820> fingers

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the way the curl goes using my fingers

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
the way the curl goes using my fingers
and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> take<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and then I'm going to take and make a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then I'm going to take and make a
circle<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:16.320> take<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.460> if

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
circle just take your time and do it if

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
circle just take your time and do it if
you're<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:17.909> familiar<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.600> pink<00:01:18.960> rolling

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you're not familiar with pink rolling

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
you're not familiar with pink rolling
takes<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.549> practice<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
takes a little practice but it's very

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.130 
takes a little practice but it's very
easy<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> takes<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> patience<00:01:24.140> now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
easy and it takes a lot of patience now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
easy and it takes a lot of patience now
you<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.070> i'm<00:01:26.159> doing<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.520> i'm<00:01:27.210> actually

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you see what i'm doing here i'm actually

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.620 
you see what i'm doing here i'm actually
tucking<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.710> hair<00:01:28.920> ends<00:01:29.430> inside<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> curl

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
tucking the hair ends inside of the curl

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.620 
tucking the hair ends inside of the curl
it's<00:01:31.619> very<00:01:31.979> important<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.000> keep<00:01:33.390> those<00:01:33.570> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's very important so you keep those in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.100 
it's very important so you keep those in
smooth<00:01:34.939> okay<00:01:35.939> once<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.720> tucked

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
smooth okay once you get it all tucked

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.819 
smooth okay once you get it all tucked
in<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.070> circular<00:01:38.310> motion<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.619> come<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
in and a circular motion just come in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
in and a circular motion just come in
with<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> large<00:01:41.549> bobby<00:01:41.939> pin<00:01:42.390> i<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.110> size

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
with a large bobby pin i use this size

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.660 
with a large bobby pin i use this size
here<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:47.399> use<00:01:48.500> two<00:01:49.500> actually<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.460> going

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
here and I use two actually so I'm going

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
here and I use two actually so I'm going
to<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:51.770> down<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.619> holds<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> pin<00:01:55.920> curl<00:01:56.579> in

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to go down and that holds a pin curl in

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.120 
to go down and that holds a pin curl in
place<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.890> crisscross<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.920> I'll<00:02:01.920> go

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
place and then I crisscross so I'll go

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.539 
place and then I crisscross so I'll go
like<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
like this

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.240 
like this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
just to keep it secure and that's hot

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.670 
just to keep it secure and that's hot
