here<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.720> let's<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.990> work<00:00:25.199> our<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.439> through

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
here so let's just work our way through

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
here so let's just work our way through
here<00:00:28.910> I'm<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> avoid<00:00:30.599> most<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> mob

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
here I'm going to avoid most of the mob

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.749 
here I'm going to avoid most of the mob
simply<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.130> don't<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> attack

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
simply because we don't need to attack

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.670 
simply because we don't need to attack
them<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> boss<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.680> for

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
them to get to a boss but like and for

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.940 
them to get to a boss but like and for
instance<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:40.140> need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> kill<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
instance here we need to kill all of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.709 
instance here we need to kill all of
these<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.000> aggro<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
these because they will aggro when the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.119 
these because they will aggro when the
bosses<00:00:42.930> Agrium's<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:47.329> ya<00:00:48.680> gonna<00:00:49.680> make<00:00:49.950> sure

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bosses Agrium's so ya gonna make sure

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.740 
bosses Agrium's so ya gonna make sure
that<00:00:50.309> they're<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> way

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.590 

I<00:01:00.460> probably<00:01:01.460> should<00:01:01.700> be<00:01:01.790> like<00:01:01.940> combat<00:01:02.450> or

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
I probably should be like combat or

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.990 
I probably should be like combat or
something<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:02.990> this<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.650> really<00:01:04.280> don't

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
something for this but I really don't

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.350 
something for this but I really don't
see<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.180> point<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.840> don't<00:01:06.290> have<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.280> gear<00:01:08.150> for

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
see the point I don't have the gear for

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.610 
see the point I don't have the gear for
combat<00:01:08.810> really<00:01:09.140> anyway<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:11.320> might<00:01:12.320> as<00:01:12.380> well

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
combat really anyway so might as well

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.330 
combat really anyway so might as well
just<00:01:12.830> get<00:01:13.040> rid<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.280> them<00:01:13.940> one<00:01:14.240> by<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:15.190> I'm<00:01:16.190> not

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
just get rid of them one by one I'm not

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.440 
just get rid of them one by one I'm not
going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.520> bother<00:01:16.640> looting<00:01:16.970> them<00:01:17.270> though
