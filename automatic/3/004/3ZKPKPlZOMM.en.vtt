off not liking it the early but we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.290 
off not liking it the early but we

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
actually ended up liking him in the end

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually ended up liking him in the end
after<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.750> first<00:03:06.960> game<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.740> got<00:03:07.920> me

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
after the first game is that we got me

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.290 
after the first game is that we got me
and<00:03:08.370> was<00:03:08.490> like<00:03:08.520> right<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.000> suddenly

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
and was like right with suddenly

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.120 
and was like right with suddenly
entirety<00:03:09.690> crotchet<00:03:10.200> well<00:03:10.620> there<00:03:10.770> was<00:03:10.800> like<00:03:10.980> no

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
entirety crotchet well there was like no

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.830 
entirety crotchet well there was like no
we<00:03:11.250> gotta<00:03:11.400> keep<00:03:11.580> going<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.150> Milner<00:03:12.540> was<00:03:12.570> one

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
we gotta keep going and Milner was one

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.270 
we gotta keep going and Milner was one
of<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> main<00:03:13.170> reasons<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.710> hated<00:03:14.070> teams

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
of the main reasons we hated teams

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.180 
of the main reasons we hated teams
because<00:03:14.520> he's<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.590> again<00:03:17.010> I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
because he's just it is so up again I

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.880 
because he's just it is so up again I
know<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> wing<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.240> 75<00:03:19.230> paise<00:03:19.410> isn't<00:03:19.740> really

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
know for a wing is 75 paise isn't really

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.440 
know for a wing is 75 paise isn't really
good<00:03:20.010> enough<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.670> he<00:03:20.760> did<00:03:20.940> towards<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
good enough is it but he did towards the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
good enough is it but he did towards the
end<00:03:21.570> he<00:03:21.660> grew<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.020> also<00:03:22.260> need<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.710> think<00:03:23.340> when

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
end he grew on also need I think when

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.370 
end he grew on also need I think when
it's<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.000> work<00:03:24.210> could<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.990> team<00:03:25.350> is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
it's that work could we this team is

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.560 
it's that work could we this team is
just<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.800> long<00:03:26.040> POC<00:03:26.310> team<00:03:26.580> basically<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.420> just

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
just a long POC team basically it's just

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.030 
just a long POC team basically it's just
you<00:03:27.840> shoot<00:03:28.080> from<00:03:28.230> anywhere<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:28.860> just

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you shoot from anywhere and it just

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.100 
you shoot from anywhere and it just
seems<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.490> be<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.700> good<00:03:29.910> effort<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:31.080> that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
seems to just be a good effort so that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.110 
seems to just be a good effort so that
brings<00:03:31.350> us<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:32.370> left<00:03:32.730> midfielder

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
brings us on to the left midfielder

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.900 
brings us on to the left midfielder
which<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.420> Steven<00:03:34.050> Pienaar<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.670> like<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
which is Steven Pienaar and like the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.430 
which is Steven Pienaar and like the
first<00:03:36.240> goal<00:03:36.480> we<00:03:36.570> scored<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:37.020> him<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.380> was

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
first goal we scored with him and it was

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
first goal we scored with him and it was
think<00:03:37.710> like<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.100> pog<00:03:38.490> from<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:39.120> 30<00:03:39.450> yards<00:03:39.810> away

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
think like a pog from like 30 yards away

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.500 
think like a pog from like 30 yards away
it<00:03:39.990> was<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.350> good<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:41.340> got<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.550> for<00:03:41.670> 16,000

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
it was so good we got in for 16,000

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.090 
it was so good we got in for 16,000
which<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.840> relatively<00:03:43.170> cheap<00:03:43.530> again<00:03:43.800> for<00:03:44.010> an

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
which is relatively cheap again for an

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.699 
which is relatively cheap again for an
in-form<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.540> don't<00:03:45.810> understand<00:03:46.380> where<00:03:46.560> I'm

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
in-form and I don't understand where I'm

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.990 
in-form and I don't understand where I'm
and<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:46.980> he<00:03:47.070> went<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.459> team<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:47.910> i've

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
and when he went on this team but i've

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000 
and when he went on this team but i've
spent<00:03:48.180> about<00:03:48.270> 400<00:03:48.870> k<00:03:49.020> on<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.260> well<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.830> less

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
spent about 400 k on it well a bit less

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.040 
spent about 400 k on it well a bit less
than<00:03:50.160> axe<00:03:50.310> I've<00:03:50.459> got<00:03:50.580> 50k<00:03:50.880> left<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.900> it's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
than axe I've got 50k left but it's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.420 
than axe I've got 50k left but it's
dribbling<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.500> probably<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> main<00:03:52.980> stat<00:03:53.280> with

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
dribbling is probably the main stat with

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.699 
dribbling is probably the main stat with
him<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:53.820> 85<00:03:54.360> overall<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.500> felt

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
him it's 85 overall but it just it felt

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.850 
him it's 85 overall but it just it felt
too<00:03:55.980> slow<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.340> make<00:03:56.610> use<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.810> again<00:03:58.110> 75

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
too slow to make use of it again 75

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.170 
too slow to make use of it again 75
paise<00:03:59.070> same<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.580> when<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.820> built<00:04:00.030> when

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
paise same as know when you built when

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.310 
paise same as know when you built when
you<00:04:00.270> beat<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> player<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.959> wanna<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
you beat a player you wanna have the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.110 
you beat a player you wanna have the
pace<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.740> just<00:04:01.950> leave<00:04:02.340> them<00:04:02.580> for<00:04:02.730> dead<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:03.090> I

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
pace to just leave them for dead like I

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.390 
pace to just leave them for dead like I
could<00:04:03.330> relax<00:04:03.600> someone<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.320> then<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.370> be

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
could relax someone and then it would be

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400 
could relax someone and then it would be
a<00:04:05.520> ballet<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.030> it'd<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.420> okay<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.020> is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
a ballet and it'd be like okay is is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.170 
a ballet and it'd be like okay is is
basically<00:04:07.830> bombing<00:04:08.430> me<00:04:08.550> again<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:08.970> what<00:04:09.120> I'm

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
basically bombing me again so what I'm

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.360 
basically bombing me again so what I'm
gonna<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:09.480> now<00:04:09.660> then<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.590> just<00:04:11.100> really

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
gonna do now then you just really

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.760 
gonna do now then you just really
with<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.760> yeah<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.390> think<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.500> one<00:04:13.650> of

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
with you yeah I think this is the one of

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.199 
with you yeah I think this is the one of
the<00:04:13.830> most<00:04:14.010> expensive<00:04:14.340> plays<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.820> team<00:04:15.030> now

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
the most expensive plays and I team now

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.729 
the most expensive plays and I team now
probably<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.750> favorite<00:04:16.109> one<00:04:16.260> informative

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
probably my favorite one informative

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.400 
probably my favorite one informative
wrapped<00:04:17.040> I've<00:04:17.489> used<00:04:17.730> them<00:04:17.850> before<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.450> look

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
wrapped I've used them before and look

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.260 
wrapped I've used them before and look
at<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.590> first<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.190> wait<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.430> five-star<00:04:21.000> skill

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
at that first I wait for five-star skill
