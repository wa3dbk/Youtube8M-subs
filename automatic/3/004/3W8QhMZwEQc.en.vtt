the knot to jump off the white road over
to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> red<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.720> itself<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> quite<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to the red which in itself is quite a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
to the red which in itself is quite a
feat<00:01:07.710> although<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> seem<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.510> one

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
feat although I seem to be the only one

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
feat although I seem to be the only one
who<00:01:09.869> thinks<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.820> getting<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> mat<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.119> jump<00:01:12.360> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
who thinks so getting the mat to jump is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
who thinks so getting the mat to jump is
relatively<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.710> here's<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> hard<00:01:14.189> part

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
relatively easy but here's the hard part

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880 
relatively easy but here's the hard part
give<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> squeeze<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.900> turn<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> into

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
give it a squeeze like this turn it into

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
give it a squeeze like this turn it into
a<00:01:16.979> sliding<00:01:17.310> nut<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.030> actually

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
a sliding nut because you can actually

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
a sliding nut because you can actually
slide<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.869> knot<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.500> off<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> rope<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
slide the knot right off the rope in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.070 
slide the knot right off the rope in
fact<00:01:20.700> completely<00:01:21.210> off<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.659> side<00:01:21.869> like

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
fact completely off the other side like

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
fact completely off the other side like
this<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.920> hardest<00:01:23.280> parts<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> hold<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> rope

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this I'm hardest parts to hold the rope

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
this I'm hardest parts to hold the rope
like<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.409> blink

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
like this and not like that don't blink

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
like this and not like that don't blink
or<00:01:25.950> you'll<00:01:26.310> miss<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.759> watch<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> rope<00:01:27.720> watch

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
or you'll miss it watch the rope watch

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.580 
or you'll miss it watch the rope watch
the<00:01:28.200> nut<00:01:28.640> right<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the nut right back on just like if you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
the nut right back on just like if you
have<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.950> magic<00:01:32.340> dust<00:01:32.549> which<00:01:32.939> conveniently

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have some magic dust which conveniently

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
have some magic dust which conveniently
enough<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.770> reach<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> pocket

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
enough I do just reach from the pocket

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
enough I do just reach from the pocket
get<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:36.240> handful<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.930> little

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
get a little handful just a little

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.749 
get a little handful just a little
sprinkle<00:01:37.530> watch<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> nut<00:01:38.159> oh<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:41.369> turns<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
