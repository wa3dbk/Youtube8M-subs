00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.040
 I believe that I consider that it is still 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.940
 a good opportunity for me this is 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.070
 good things come 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.300
 I still think that it was a very 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 very good 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.730
 and I hope this happens good good things 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 with them I want something very clear 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 Of course if I leave this I want it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 use as a trampoline but I want that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.040
 they also use to do 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 spend the best afternoons the best 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.310
 I'll be at your side this ends my 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.440
 development and if they grow but what 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.920
 important is to fight not to fight 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.579
 fall down work work so I think 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.680
 that making this decision does not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.600
 it's because it was because it's already 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370
 fully developed no no me either 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.140
 I say that I am fully developed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.060
 What I need is missing but I want 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.530
 finish my development already 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.440
 you have to take it also as a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.690
 trampoline how to keep growing this 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.330
 keep developing to do good 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 things correctly pass many reasons 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.770
 nice things this power we also have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 the mind of being able to reach the selection 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.310
 higher 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.740
 and afterwards we already know one has to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.100
 believe in yourself I do not say do not avoid 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.440
 and later but I'm going to work for 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 give the maximum and can be called that is 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.210
 which is the dream of every young Mexican 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.550
 I think I like everyone when well 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.500
 I really like to play how they play this 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.570
 giovanni I like to play in the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.240
 position and that of giovanni we know 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.310
 of chicherit as it does here does not stop 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.350
 they are very good players and it is very 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 competitive so that's why you have to 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 work during has 2 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.310
 Two Latinas with whom I Myself 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.160
 I spoke with the Chilean felipe unes 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 us roberto rosales de venezuela 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.480
 then there I had the fortune to be able 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 talk more or less how the school 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.479
 and how game was life 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.110
 then also to youtube people 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.110
 talk with the teacher 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.940
 translating and everything but they 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.649
 they said that what luck with that is the visa 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.710
 and that returning we talked about the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.570
 football as it came playing which 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.570
 were his statistics then
