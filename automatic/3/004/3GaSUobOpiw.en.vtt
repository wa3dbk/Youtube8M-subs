00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.009
 of some black ops mimetics 2 later 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 survey and exit of camouflage 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 cyborgs and dragon that have been released a few 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 days ago on xbox live and that soon 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 we will also have on psn have started to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 turn on the net and won dmt that strange 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.380
 some say they are glitches other than 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 the 3 iarc inserted them as hidden e 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 you have to do certain things to get them 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.160
 or that will insert them in the next ones 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.469
 dlc in which I turned on case I really am 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.530
 spectacular we go to list the ice 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.960
 blue camouflage in ice blue style that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
 even in the dark by a nice effect of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.850
 lighting we say shown in the video 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.850
 on the k sg looks really not bad 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.129
 here we are zombie pack up this is also the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.949
 tisma photo in the ethics of those fucking 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.140
 already called a zombie where after spending 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 5,000 fucking points 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 you have any fucking weapon with 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 this potuti magnetic then pulls 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.119
 out of that fucking wallet 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.119
 of the votes I said to myself and buy the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.950
 developers of this camouflage is given 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.869
 very little 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.759
 some say it is camouflaged on the ground 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.640
 where others are found to be only 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.150
 green all in all it does not seem this 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 much less this legendary for 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 the note is called the man who means 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 swamp although more than swamp seem 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.270
 some yellow paint stains look like 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.530
 to stay in a real paintball field 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 electric 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 this is america cooler than in all 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.220
 the call-of-duty years he has ever seen 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.729
 the first animated oblivion I see 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 so whoever should let her out 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 because otherwise and canids seems every 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.700
 time it will ruin yours 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.729
 company in a dime 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.729
 kind regards 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.810
 but now here we are at the ip moment of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.610
 call of Duty 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.290
 if you love the flowery meadows or the net of the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 factors that listen from morning to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.180
 sera bob marley this mythical is perfect 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.920
 for you also go to this one not you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.210
 he knows a lot 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.750
 rumors say it is a map of the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.760
 nevada in this pretty beige color but 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.620
 It could have been done better 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720
 of course you could understand a little more if 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 the guy who was playing in this 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.450
 moment has been a little more firm 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.430
 but okay this will be practically the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.110
 usual desert camouflage present in others 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 call of duty as a way to be two for 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.940
 example to me honestly like 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.420
 a lot in its simplicity but they are 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.420
 personal tastes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 tiger mimetic my opinion really 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.080
 as spectacular as it will be a return 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.520
 to the old camouflage because e 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.190
 represent in black ops one if not 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.320
 I believe that on snipers it is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.560
 really scary, here we are 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.050
 at the last colors this is the camouflage 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.209
 of which we speak more about these colors 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.670
 fluo without details that each 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.350
 re-determined seconds change if 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.209
 this camouflage really had to come out 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.020
 I bet you will be the best selling in 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.120
 unique absolute in quotation marks is sin 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.209
 as you see in the video the executioners 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.530
 redheads really look like toys 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.530
 hand and bobo here we like cda 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.990
