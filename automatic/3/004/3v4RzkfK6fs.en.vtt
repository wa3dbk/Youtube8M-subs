00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.900 

okay<00:00:14.870> well<00:00:15.110> we<00:00:15.769> we've<00:00:16.250> run<00:00:16.460> around<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.730> lake<00:00:16.880> a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
okay well we we've run around the lake a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.839 
okay well we we've run around the lake a
couple<00:00:17.300> times<00:00:18.279> went<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:19.369> fished<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.610> couple

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
couple times went and fished a couple

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.220 
couple times went and fished a couple
main<00:00:20.000> body<00:00:20.210> creeks<00:00:20.539> I've<00:00:20.750> fished<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.080> main

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
main body creeks I've fished the main

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.339 
main body creeks I've fished the main
river<00:00:21.579> you<00:00:22.579> know<00:00:22.700> the<00:00:22.910> I<00:00:23.390> guess<00:00:23.779> from<00:00:24.020> when<00:00:24.230> the

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
river you know the I guess from when the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.260 
river you know the I guess from when the
lake<00:00:24.680> was<00:00:24.860> way<00:00:25.009> down<00:00:25.220> during<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.640> drought<00:00:25.849> and

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
lake was way down during the drought and

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.120 
lake was way down during the drought and
when<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.840> flooded<00:00:27.110> basically<00:00:27.800> had<00:00:27.890> just

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
when it flooded basically had just

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.740 
when it flooded basically had just
washed<00:00:28.369> out<00:00:28.610> all<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:28.820> old<00:00:28.969> bushes<00:00:29.450> so<00:00:29.599> it's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
washed out all the old bushes so it's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.929 
washed out all the old bushes so it's
really<00:00:29.930> hard<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.349> find<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:31.340> know<00:00:31.460> structure

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
really hard to find you know structure

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.180 
really hard to find you know structure
in<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.239> river<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.559> seems<00:00:33.800> like<00:00:34.010> in

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
in the river and and it seems like in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.040 
in the river and and it seems like in
these<00:00:34.309> creeks<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.090> fish<00:00:35.329> aren't<00:00:35.570> there<00:00:35.780> yet<00:00:35.930> I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
these creeks the fish aren't there yet I

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.860 
these creeks the fish aren't there yet I
mean<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:36.290> got<00:00:36.440> water<00:00:36.860> temps<00:00:37.219> in<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.340> upper<00:00:37.460> 70s

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
mean we got water temps in the upper 70s

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.910 
mean we got water temps in the upper 70s
so<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:38.989> really<00:00:39.230> hasn't<00:00:39.500> started

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
so it really hasn't started

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.760 
so it really hasn't started
transitioning<00:00:40.489> into<00:00:40.640> fall<00:00:40.879> yet<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.770> there's

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
transitioning into fall yet and there's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.130 
transitioning into fall yet and there's
tons<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.399> little<00:00:43.700> bait<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.180> as<00:00:44.660> well<00:00:44.870> as<00:00:44.960> baby

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
most of our bodies and water you know

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.140 
most of our bodies and water you know
this<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.439> clone<00:01:48.650> fry<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.760> difference

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
this is the clone fry and the difference

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.490 
this is the clone fry and the difference
is<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.790> we've<00:01:52.909> got<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.060> clone<00:01:53.330> fry<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.380> we've

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
is so we've got a clone fry and we've

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.590 
is so we've got a clone fry and we've
got<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.650> super<00:01:55.280> cross<00:01:55.670> tail<00:01:55.939> shed<00:01:58.330> clone<00:01:59.330> fry

this time of year late summer you know
like<00:02:40.849> we're<00:02:41.030> doing<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.890> water<00:02:43.069> temp

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
like we're doing here and the water temp

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.009 
like we're doing here and the water temp
is<00:02:43.489> high<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:46.040> know<00:02:46.159> it's<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.599> it's<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.810> tough

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
is high you know it's it's it's a tough

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.960 
is high you know it's it's it's a tough
situation<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.709> catch<00:02:48.950> fish<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:49.849> of

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
situation to catch fish in because of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.649 
situation to catch fish in because of
all<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.209> bait

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
all the bait

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.319 
all the bait
you<00:02:50.750> know<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.019> bait<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.349> on<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> surface<00:02:52.329> so

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
you know the bait is on the surface so

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.429 
you know the bait is on the surface so
you<00:02:53.389> can<00:02:53.569> either<00:02:53.689> catch<00:02:53.959> them<00:02:54.109> one<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.230> two

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
you can either catch them one of two

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.129 
you can either catch them one of two
ways<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.579> first<00:02:55.760> way<00:02:55.939> which<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.629> mean<00:02:57.049> I

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
ways the first way which I mean I

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.629 
ways the first way which I mean I
usually<00:02:57.409> can<00:02:57.799> catch<00:02:57.980> them<00:02:58.129> like<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.459> but

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
usually can catch them like this but

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.339 
usually can catch them like this but
it's<00:02:59.000> been<00:02:59.150> really<00:02:59.359> difficult<00:02:59.900> to<00:02:59.989> find<00:03:00.200> them

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
it's been really difficult to find them

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.410 
it's been really difficult to find them
is<00:03:00.560> by<00:03:01.159> watching<00:03:01.430> your<00:03:01.700> graph<00:03:01.939> you<00:03:02.180> know<00:03:02.209> when

is by watching your graph you know when

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.300 
is by watching your graph you know when
you're<00:03:02.540> going<00:03:02.720> along<00:03:02.989> these<00:03:03.200> banks<00:03:03.650> or<00:03:03.799> points

you're going along these banks or points

you're going along these banks or points
or<00:03:04.459> bluffs<00:03:04.849> you'll<00:03:05.780> see<00:03:06.049> them<00:03:06.169> either

like<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.009> started<00:05:52.639> out<00:05:52.789> saying<00:05:53.000> this<00:05:53.210> morning<00:05:53.419> I

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
like I started out saying this morning I

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.420 
like I started out saying this morning I
really<00:05:54.560> thought<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.889> fish<00:05:55.039> were<00:05:55.159> going<00:05:55.279> to<00:05:55.370> be

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
really thought the fish were going to be

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.029 
really thought the fish were going to be
going<00:05:56.000> into<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.389> creeks<00:05:56.659> but<00:05:56.899> you<00:05:57.680> know<00:05:57.770> today

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
going into the creeks but you know today

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.740 
going into the creeks but you know today
was<00:05:58.219> in<00:05:58.339> the<00:05:58.430> 90s<00:05:58.819> up<00:05:59.000> here<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.330> wasn't<00:05:59.719> a

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
was in the 90s up here it wasn't a

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.670 
was in the 90s up here it wasn't a
breath<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.080> wind<00:06:01.360> so<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.389> really<00:06:03.080> think<00:06:03.349> you

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
breath of wind so I really think you

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.649 
breath of wind so I really think you
know<00:06:03.770> after<00:06:04.009> seeing<00:06:04.039> the<00:06:04.430> whole<00:06:04.849> Lake<00:06:05.060> I<00:06:05.330> mean
