00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it looks real you can leave it like that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
it looks real you can leave it like that
but<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.810> want<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.500> depth<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> look<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
but I want more depth in the look so I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
but I want more depth in the look so I
used<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.299> band<00:01:48.570> night<00:01:48.840> master<00:01:49.290> blues<00:01:49.619> view<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
used my band night master blues view I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.340 
used my band night master blues view I
start<00:01:50.430> using<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.970> dark<00:01:51.240> red<00:01:51.479> first<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.170> also

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
start using the dark red first but also

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
start using the dark red first but also
the<00:01:52.619> lightest<00:01:52.950> red<00:01:53.159> later<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.850> also<00:01:54.030> going

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the lightest red later on I'm also going

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
the lightest red later on I'm also going
to<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.990> blue<00:01:55.170> version<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
to use the blue version out of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
to use the blue version out of the
palette<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.790> start<00:01:57.060> filling<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> hole

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
palette and I start filling in the hole

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.280 
palette and I start filling in the hole

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so you can get a more nasty Gore effect

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
so you can get a more nasty Gore effect
and<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.430> want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> make<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
more nasty because it's already nasty

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459
