controllers have had wise

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.330 
controllers have had wise
they've<00:01:12.190> been<00:01:12.340> necessary<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.540> annoying<00:01:13.930> and

things you accept it
we<00:01:20.080> always<00:01:20.259> think<00:01:20.530> surely<00:01:21.100> one<00:01:21.280> day<00:01:21.460> they'll

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
we always think surely one day they'll

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.600 
we always think surely one day they'll
be<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.090> better<00:01:22.330> option<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.800> bet<00:01:24.070> option<00:01:24.429> is

leaves<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:26.770> won't<00:01:27.039> actually<00:01:27.270> fantasticly

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
leaves they won't actually fantasticly

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
leaves they won't actually fantasticly
now<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.560> must<00:01:29.890> be<00:01:30.009> wondering<00:01:30.039> how<00:01:30.759> do<00:01:30.820> these

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
now you must be wondering how do these

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.740 
now you must be wondering how do these
work<00:01:31.060> well<00:01:32.130> obviously<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> back<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
work well obviously this is back in the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.399 
work well obviously this is back in the
early<00:01:35.320> nights<00:01:36.130> right<00:01:36.789> there<00:01:37.210> was<00:01:37.330> no<00:01:37.570> Wi-Fi<00:01:38.020> or

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
early nights right there was no Wi-Fi or

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.850 
early nights right there was no Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth<00:01:38.979> or<00:01:39.009> any<00:01:39.850> kind<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.240> digital

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
Bluetooth or any kind of digital

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.770 
Bluetooth or any kind of digital
wireless<00:01:41.860> data<00:01:42.640> transmission<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.509> their

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
wireless data transmission on their

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
wireless data transmission on their
mobile<00:01:44.080> phones

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
mobile phones

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.719 
mobile phones
so<00:01:45.700> these<00:01:46.210> use<00:01:46.539> infrared<00:01:47.399> exactly<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.460> same

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
so these use infrared exactly the same

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.270 
so these use infrared exactly the same
as<00:01:48.850> how<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.270> remote<00:01:49.450> control<00:01:49.750> works<00:01:50.280> now

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
as how your remote control works now

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.010 
as how your remote control works now
think<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.759> these<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.270> right

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
think that these is right

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.919 
think that these is right
you<00:01:53.979> can't<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.429> that<00:01:54.550> much<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.910> an<00:01:55.660> Xbox

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
you can't is that much like an Xbox

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.729 
you can't is that much like an Xbox
controller<00:01:56.170> or<00:01:56.770> ps3<00:01:57.599> right<00:01:58.599> but<00:01:59.349> these<00:01:59.530> you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
controller or ps3 right but these you

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.469 
controller or ps3 right but these you
have<00:01:59.770> to<00:02:00.039> actually<00:02:00.310> point<00:02:00.550> at<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:00.940> receiver

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
have to actually point at the receiver

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.479 
have to actually point at the receiver
then<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.319> has<00:02:02.590> got<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.830> certain<00:02:03.220> degree<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
then it has got a certain degree of

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:04.949 
then it has got a certain degree of
flexibility<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.060> mean<00:02:04.270> literally<00:02:04.780> if<00:02:04.840> your

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
flexibility I mean literally if your

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.740 
flexibility I mean literally if your
point<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.739> important<00:02:06.280> direct<00:02:06.489> active<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.599> can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
point is important direct active you can

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.559 
point is important direct active you can
tell<00:02:07.929> it's<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:08.259> much<00:02:08.410> up<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.310> much<00:02:09.429> down<00:02:09.849> so

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
tell it's so much up so much down so

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.350 
tell it's so much up so much down so
much<00:02:10.810> they're<00:02:11.110> there<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:12.310> ultimately<00:02:12.970> this

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
much they're there but ultimately this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.580 
much they're there but ultimately this
signal<00:02:13.720> has<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:15.160> straight<00:02:15.790> issue

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
signal has to be pretty straight issue

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.990 
signal has to be pretty straight issue
simplify<00:02:17.590> edit<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.160> are<00:02:18.340> facing<00:02:18.610> directly

now this isn't the official measure of
our<00:02:27.670> controls<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.450> they're<00:02:29.200> extremely
