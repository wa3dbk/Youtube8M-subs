hello<00:00:04.080> welcome<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.799> Linux<00:00:05.250> game<00:00:05.580> world<00:00:05.970> today

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
hello welcome to Linux game world today

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.830 
hello welcome to Linux game world today
we<00:00:06.930> are<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.620> take<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> look<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.840> creating

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
we are going to take a look at creating

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.999 
we are going to take a look at creating
power<00:00:10.590> rails<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.870> move<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
power rails so that we can move the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.939 
power rails so that we can move the
minecart<00:00:14.880> where<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.330> want<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.949> but

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
minecart where we want it to go but

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.750 
minecart where we want it to go but
first<00:00:17.330> it's<00:00:18.330> night<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:20.250> need<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> be

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
first it's night and we need it to be

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.179 
first it's night and we need it to be
day<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.609> let's<00:00:23.609> make<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.210> bed<00:00:24.570> isn't<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.680> nice

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
day so let's make a bed isn't that nice

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.230 
day so let's make a bed isn't that nice
look<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.910> oh<00:00:27.470> yeah

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
look at that oh yeah

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.850 
look at that oh yeah
so<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> three<00:00:31.230> wool<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.949> need

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
so we have the three wool that we need

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:44.360 
so we have the three wool that we need
so<00:00:34.860> let's<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> bed<00:00:42.739> if<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.950> remember

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so let's make a bed if I remember

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.279 
so let's make a bed if I remember
correctly

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
correctly

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:53.360 
correctly
no<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.770> wall<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:49.460> wood<00:00:50.460> planks<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:52.370> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
no it's wall here wood planks here and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
no it's wall here wood planks here and
we<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> basic<00:00:54.210> bed<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.230> make

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
we have a basic bed I think we can make

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:07.910 
we have a basic bed I think we can make
it<00:00:55.559> fancy<00:00:57.109> know<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:06.049> basic<00:01:07.049> bed<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.619> enough

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it fancy know a basic bed is good enough

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.149 
it fancy know a basic bed is good enough
that's<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> say<00:01:09.950> simple<00:01:10.950> bed<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:13.159> let's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that's what I say simple bed and let's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:26.679 
that's what I say simple bed and let's
put<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:19.070> there

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.450 

daytime<00:01:27.689> hooray

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.679 

okay<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:35.090> minecart<00:01:36.090> rails<00:01:38.329> wave<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
okay to the minecart rails wave at the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.130 
okay to the minecart rails wave at the
dock<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> way<00:01:40.350> by<00:01:40.560> hello<00:01:41.040> doc<00:01:41.720> up<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
dock on the way by hello doc up here it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.950 
dock on the way by hello doc up here it
is<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.710> cow

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
is the cow

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
is the cow
so<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.320> let's<00:01:49.860> make<00:01:50.130> more<00:01:50.460> power<00:01:50.759> rails<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so first let's make more power rails to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.110 
so first let's make more power rails to
do<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:53.030> take<00:01:54.030> steel<00:01:58.850> and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
do that take steel and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.840 
do that take steel and
the<00:02:01.240> stick<00:02:02.730> anna<00:02:03.730> mezack<00:02:04.240> crystal<00:02:04.690> fragment

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the stick anna mezack crystal fragment

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.200 
the stick anna mezack crystal fragment
power<00:02:06.850> rails<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:08.340> still<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:09.520> know<00:02:09.610> why<00:02:09.940> they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
power rails I still don't know why they

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.080 
power rails I still don't know why they
call<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.510> Meza<00:02:11.230> crystal<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.930> basically<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
call it Meza crystal it's basically the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.440 
call it Meza crystal it's basically the
the<00:02:16.630> mind<00:02:17.260> test<00:02:17.650> version<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.430> redstone<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the mind test version of redstone and

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.210 
the mind test version of redstone and
now<00:02:19.900> let's<00:02:20.140> make<00:02:20.320> some<00:02:20.620> more<00:02:20.800> Meza<00:02:21.460> torches<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
now let's make some more Meza torches so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.970 
now let's make some more Meza torches so
we<00:02:24.310> need<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.460> stick<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:27.030> mezack<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.830> gives<00:02:29.830> us

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
we need a stick and mezack on gives us

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.670 
we need a stick and mezack on gives us
more<00:02:30.220> mine<00:02:31.950> mine<00:02:33.450> mine<00:02:34.680> Meza<00:02:35.680> torches<00:02:36.670> yes<00:02:37.680> we

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
more mine mine mine Meza torches yes we

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.440 
more mine mine mine Meza torches yes we
need<00:02:38.860> those<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.580> power<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.960> rails<00:02:45.240> let's<00:02:46.240> go

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
need those to power the rails let's go

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.260 
need those to power the rails let's go
try<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.780> out

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.690 

wave<00:02:52.270> at<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.630> creature<00:02:52.840> hello<00:02:53.620> creature<00:02:54.100> what

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
wave at the creature hello creature what

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.180 
wave at the creature hello creature what
bow<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.900> didn't<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.410> that<00:03:01.650> now<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.710> plan<00:03:03.160> is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
bow it didn't like that now the plan is

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.910 
bow it didn't like that now the plan is
up<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:04.000> know<00:03:04.090> what<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.240> forgot<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.930> need<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:06.100> put

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
up you know what I forgot I need to put

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.220 
up you know what I forgot I need to put
the<00:03:08.920> Meza<00:03:09.370> torches<00:03:11.160> by<00:03:12.160> each<00:03:12.690> set<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.840> power

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
the Meza torches by each set of power

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:34.530 
the Meza torches by each set of power
rails<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.910 

the<00:03:35.540> idea<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.640> we'll<00:03:37.640> push<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.630> cart<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.140> then

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
the idea is we'll push the cart and then

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.130 
the idea is we'll push the cart and then
jump<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.610> really<00:03:40.820> quickly<00:03:41.180> before<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.780> gets<00:03:41.810> to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
jump in really quickly before it gets to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.890 
jump in really quickly before it gets to
this<00:03:42.260> first<00:03:42.560> powered<00:03:43.280> rail<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.970> then

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
this first powered rail and then

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.680 
this first powered rail and then
hopefully<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.530> powered<00:03:45.920> rails<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:47.240> take<00:03:47.480> us

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
hopefully the powered rails will take us

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.050 
hopefully the powered rails will take us
along<00:03:48.230> all<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:49.130> way<00:03:49.250> through<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.820> rail

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
along all the way through the rail

00:03:50.060 --> 00:04:03.190 
along all the way through the rail
system<00:03:50.890> here<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:52.370> go.we<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:01.340> working<00:04:02.200> it's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
system here we go.we it's working it's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.150 
system here we go.we it's working it's
working

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:19.380 

very<00:04:10.160> good<00:04:12.820> perfect<00:04:16.900> excellent

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
very good perfect excellent

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.860 
very good perfect excellent
tada<00:04:23.650> we<00:04:24.650> have<00:04:24.920> successfully<00:04:25.660> put<00:04:26.660> together

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
tada we have successfully put together

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.970 
tada we have successfully put together
and<00:04:27.350> use<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.650> rail<00:04:28.250> system<00:04:29.500> let's<00:04:30.500> put<00:04:30.770> down<00:04:30.920> a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
and use the rail system let's put down a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.180 
and use the rail system let's put down a
few<00:04:31.460> more<00:04:31.670> rails<00:04:32.060> here<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.110> can<00:04:33.380> send<00:04:34.040> the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
few more rails here so we can send the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.150 
few more rails here so we can send the
cart<00:04:34.490> back<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> opposite<00:04:36.320> direction<00:04:36.530> and

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
cart back in the opposite direction and
