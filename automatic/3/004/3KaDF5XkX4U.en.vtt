support that much and the pistol is a

the<00:00:37.350> best<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.769> if<00:00:37.979> you<00:00:38.580> can<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:39.449> it<00:00:39.659> properly

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
the best one if you can use it properly

now<00:00:42.330> when<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.409> begin<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:44.190> game<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.760> should

now when you begin your game you should

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.710 
now when you begin your game you should
always<00:00:45.120> always<00:00:45.739> do<00:00:46.739> what's<00:00:47.280> shown<00:00:47.549> here<00:00:47.720> not

time as if the second and third type are
easier<00:01:12.930> than<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> third<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> fourth<00:01:14.550> type

easier than the third and fourth type
when<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.260> have<00:01:16.410> dealt<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.860> first<00:01:17.070> and

when you have dealt with first and

when you have dealt with first and
second<00:01:17.970> hives<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.810> should<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.200> upgraded

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
second hives you should have upgraded

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.900 
second hives you should have upgraded
the<00:01:20.400> Magnum<00:01:20.820> twice<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:22.080> ammo<00:01:22.350> twice

the Magnum twice and your ammo twice
then<00:01:23.910> move<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.900> third<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> fourth<00:01:26.520> hive

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
then move to the third and fourth hive

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420 
then move to the third and fourth hive
will<00:01:27.240> before<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.810> buy<00:01:28.440> yourself<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.040> vector

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
will before that buy yourself a vector

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
will before that buy yourself a vector
and<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.300> destroy<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.840> third<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> fourth

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.490 
and can destroy the third and fourth
time<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.820> before<00:01:33.330> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:33.990> third<00:01:34.170> hive

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
time also before going to the third hive

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.070 
time also before going to the third hive
it's<00:01:34.770> useful<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.300> grab<00:01:36.570> yourself<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
it's useful to go and grab yourself a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's useful to go and grab yourself a

Phantom<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.560> easier<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:41.580> deal<00:01:41.730> with<00:01:41.760> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
Phantom is so much easier to deal with a

that's<00:03:14.709> where<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.069> seems<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.579> take<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.879> most

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
that's where it seems to take the most

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.589 
that's where it seems to take the most
damage<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.599> it's<00:03:16.750> easier<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.440> hit<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.940> do

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
damage and it's easier to hit just do

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.259 
damage and it's easier to hit just do
that<00:03:19.780> cover<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.620> again<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.430> cover<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.120> again

and<00:03:22.600> cover<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.920> should<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.280> done<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:25.139> if

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
and cover and it should be done and if

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.190 
and cover and it should be done and if
you<00:03:26.200> get<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.310> I'm<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.239> sure<00:03:28.480> if<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.780> can<00:03:28.810> but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
you get the I'm not sure if you can but

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.550 
you get the I'm not sure if you can but
if<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.470> get<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.739> eggs<00:03:29.950> challenge<00:03:30.519> just

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
if you get the eggs challenge just

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.009 
if you get the eggs challenge just
stretch<00:03:32.560> out<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> fight<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.750> destroyed<00:03:34.750> eggs

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
stretch out the fight and destroyed eggs

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.870 
stretch out the fight and destroyed eggs
first<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.530> then<00:03:35.650> kill<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> breeder<00:03:36.280> body<00:03:36.579> I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
first and then kill the breeder body I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.940 
first and then kill the breeder body I
think<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.510> solo<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.019> can<00:03:38.200> only<00:03:38.380> get<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
think that in solo you can only get the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.420 
think that in solo you can only get the
time<00:03:39.190> challenge<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.819> kill<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:42.160> is

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
time challenge and to kill it in what is

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.150 
time challenge and to kill it in what is
it<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.790> over<00:03:43.329> one<00:03:43.569> or<00:03:43.599> two<00:03:43.989> minutes<00:03:44.319> it's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
it like over one or two minutes it's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.900 
it like over one or two minutes it's
pretty<00:03:45.700> easy<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.810> if<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.700> pistols<00:03:48.700> only

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
pretty easy but if you have pistols only

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120 
pretty easy but if you have pistols only
you<00:03:49.269> should<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.660> really<00:03:50.139> really<00:03:50.410> close<00:03:50.769> range

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
you should be really really close range

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.750 
you should be really really close range
to<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.760> as<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.599> easy<00:03:53.760> without

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
to do that as it's not that easy without

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.990 
to do that as it's not that easy without
proper<00:03:55.060> fully<00:03:55.450> automatic<00:03:55.989> firearms<00:03:56.940> when<00:03:57.940> you

now after this area I will explain how

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.760 
now after this area I will explain how
to<00:06:15.300> defeat<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.840> freedom<00:06:16.169> really<00:06:17.159> really<00:06:17.699> easy

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
to defeat the freedom really really easy

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.080 
to defeat the freedom really really easy
all<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:20.099> really<00:06:20.310> need<00:06:20.580> is<00:06:21.560> just<00:06:22.560> keep<00:06:23.279> taking

and kill or the seekers and to the face
it's<00:06:33.029> that<00:06:33.810> simple<00:06:34.080> when<00:06:34.770> it<00:06:34.860> goes<00:06:35.039> down<00:06:35.069> you

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
it's that simple when it goes down you

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.870 
it's that simple when it goes down you
should<00:06:35.610> use<00:06:36.029> your<00:06:36.060> winner<00:06:36.569> Max<00:06:36.779> and<00:06:37.020> the<00:06:37.440> most

gene weapon you have which should be the

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.550 
gene weapon you have which should be the
vector<00:06:39.920> l<00:06:40.310> or<00:06:40.550> I've<00:06:40.820> set<00:06:41.150> as<00:06:41.330> they<00:06:42.050> both<00:06:42.290> are

vector l or I've set as they both are

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.070 
vector l or I've set as they both are
pretty<00:06:43.070> good<00:06:43.370> at<00:06:43.550> close<00:06:43.820> range<00:06:44.120> and<00:06:44.420> shoot<00:06:44.780> the

you will find it once again but now it
has<00:07:30.740> one<00:07:31.310> more<00:07:31.520> move<00:07:31.730> it<00:07:31.880> can<00:07:32.090> do<00:07:32.210> which<00:07:32.540> is

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 
has one more move it can do which is

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.040 
take help from them and you should

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.270 
take help from them and you should
always<00:07:40.340> always<00:07:40.780> prior<00:07:41.920> prioritize<00:07:42.920> them

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 
always always prior prioritize them

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.160 
always always prior prioritize them
first<00:07:43.580> and<00:07:43.820> destroyed<00:07:44.270> and<00:07:44.420> as<00:07:44.630> fast<00:07:44.960> as

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.170 
first and destroyed and as fast as

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.410 
first and destroyed and as fast as
possible<00:07:45.380> this<00:07:46.040> it<00:07:46.190> starts<00:07:46.670> to<00:07:46.850> absorb<00:07:46.940> them

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:47.420 
possible this it starts to absorb them

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.090 
possible this it starts to absorb them
pretty<00:07:47.690> pretty<00:07:48.200> fast<00:07:48.590> and<00:07:48.890> it's<00:07:49.220> bullshit<00:07:49.760> and

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.100 
pretty pretty fast and it's bullshit and

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.650 
pretty pretty fast and it's bullshit and
besides<00:07:52.100> that<00:07:52.220> just<00:07:52.700> use<00:07:52.910> the<00:07:53.060> same<00:07:53.240> tactic

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660 
besides that just use the same tactic
