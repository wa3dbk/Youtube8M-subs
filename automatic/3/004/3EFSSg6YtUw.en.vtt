00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:37.380 
to show you a little trick you can play
fast<00:00:16.740> triplets

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.110 

pretty<00:00:38.390> cool<00:00:38.649> so<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.370> way<00:00:40.520> I'm<00:00:40.670> playing<00:00:40.820> this

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
pretty cool so the way I'm playing this

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.710 
pretty cool so the way I'm playing this
is<00:00:41.360> I'm<00:00:41.660> picking<00:00:42.500> with<00:00:43.430> an<00:00:43.520> upstroke<00:00:43.970> on<00:00:44.300> the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
is I'm picking with an upstroke on the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.900 
is I'm picking with an upstroke on the
high<00:00:44.870> E<00:00:44.900> string<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:47.059> bottom<00:00:47.329> string<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.910> then

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
high E string the bottom string and then

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.380 
high E string the bottom string and then
I'm<00:00:50.210> switching<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.110> B<00:00:51.350> string<00:00:51.680> third<00:00:52.160> fret<00:00:52.390> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
I'm switching to B string third fret and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.610 
I'm switching to B string third fret and
then<00:00:53.570> I'm<00:00:53.720> picking<00:00:53.900> down<00:00:54.470> with<00:00:54.739> my<00:00:54.890> pick<00:00:55.220> there

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
then I'm picking down with my pick there

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
then I'm picking down with my pick there
I'm<00:00:57.620> gonna<00:00:57.830> do<00:00:58.010> pull<00:00:58.250> off

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.960 

and<00:01:01.989> that's<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.190> technique<00:01:03.670> right<00:01:03.910> there

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
and that's the technique right there

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:16.130 
and that's the technique right there
then<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:05.140> repeat<00:01:05.440> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770 

and<00:01:16.800> then<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.010> guys<00:01:17.130> move<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:18.390> finger<00:01:18.750> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and then you guys move your finger on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.590 
and then you guys move your finger on
the<00:01:18.960> B<00:01:19.080> string<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.940> whatever<00:01:20.940> you<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> go

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the B string to whatever you want to go

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.380 
the B string to whatever you want to go
you<00:01:22.260> could<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.740> course<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.940> E<00:01:23.970> minor

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you could of course just do the E minor

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:38.620 
you could of course just do the E minor
pentatonic

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.709 

and<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:41.460> works<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.600> play

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
and it works well you know you can play

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.980 
and it works well you know you can play
fast<00:01:43.679> line<00:01:44.009> stone<00:01:44.310> without<00:01:45.179> having<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.869> do

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
fast line stone without having to do

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.490 
fast line stone without having to do
alternate<00:01:46.409> picking<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:48.320> another<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
alternate picking and another way you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
alternate picking and another way you
can<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.979> course<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.640> chicken

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can do it of course is do that chicken

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.230 
can do it of course is do that chicken
picking<00:01:51.329> style<00:01:51.569> where<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.069> used<00:01:53.069> your<00:01:53.549> middle

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
picking style where you used your middle

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.080 
picking style where you used your middle
finger<00:01:54.539> on<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.719> E<00:01:55.079> string<00:01:55.200> instead

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.300 

but<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.710> it's<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.830> little<00:02:07.860> different

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
but it's it's a little different

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
but it's it's a little different
technique<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.300> probably<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.960> little<00:02:10.050> bit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
technique and it's probably a little bit

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
technique and it's probably a little bit
harder<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.710> it<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.920> way<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.510> has<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
harder to do it that way but it has a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:27.589 
harder to do it that way but it has a
different<00:02:13.050> sound<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> zap<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.410 

you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.709> make<00:02:28.859> up<00:02:28.980> cool<00:02:29.249> licks<00:02:29.999> with<00:02:30.120> this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
you can make up cool licks with this

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.660 
you can make up cool licks with this
technique<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.799> usually<00:02:32.310> play<00:02:32.549> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
technique so the way I usually play it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:03:15.010 
technique so the way I usually play it
is<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.999> the<00:02:33.120> second<00:02:33.540> note<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> downbeat

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.710 

you<00:03:16.020> know<00:03:16.110> cool<00:03:16.800> idea<00:03:17.130> all<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.490> it's<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.600> a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you know cool idea all right it's it's a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
you know cool idea all right it's it's a
technique<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.200> can<00:03:20.100> lead<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.600> sweet<00:03:21.600> licks

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
technique that can lead to sweet licks

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:32.350 
technique that can lead to sweet licks
and<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:23.250> course<00:03:23.550> impressive<00:03:24.210> sounding<00:03:24.780> fast

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.350 

but<00:03:33.360> speed<00:03:34.080> isn't<00:03:34.380> everything<00:03:34.820> always<00:03:35.820> go<00:03:36.150> for

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
but speed isn't everything always go for

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.920 
but speed isn't everything always go for
taste<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.810> say<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.270> just<00:03:39.450> play<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> little

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
taste I say you know just play a little

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:56.340 
taste I say you know just play a little
bit<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.230> it

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:24.700 

another<00:03:57.350> string

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.230 

there<00:04:25.710> we<00:04:25.800> go<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.430> phone's<00:04:26.670> ringing<00:04:26.790> so
