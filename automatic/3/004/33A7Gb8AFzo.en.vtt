00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
who comes in the 130 pounds and Amazon

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
UK and the AVA media comes in at 160
pounds<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> UK<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.440> there's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> 30<00:00:44.219> 30

pounds in the UK so there's a 30 30

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.130

pound<00:00:45.000> police<00:00:45.300> difference<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
pound police difference up to the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.529 
pound police difference up to the
AVerMedia<00:00:46.410> I'll<00:00:47.190> explain<00:00:47.700> why<00:00:47.940> maybe<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
AVerMedia I'll explain why maybe in a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
AVerMedia I'll explain why maybe in a
minute<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> US<00:00:50.360> Amazon<00:00:51.620> site<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.360> 159

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
minute on the US Amazon site it is 159

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.860 
minute on the US Amazon site it is 159
dollars<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> elgato<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.579> 179<00:00:57.480> dollars

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
dollars for the elgato and 179 dollars

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
dollars for the elgato and 179 dollars
for<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> AVerMedia<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.789> approach

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
for the AVerMedia so this that approach

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
for the AVerMedia so this that approach
jump<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> AVerMedia<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
jump to the AVerMedia but it's not so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
jump to the AVerMedia but it's not so
much<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.100> terms<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> US<00:01:02.879> dollars<00:01:03.120> than<00:01:03.449> there

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
much in terms of US dollars than there

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
much in terms of US dollars than there
is<00:01:03.629> compared<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> UK<00:01:04.559> pounds<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.540> said

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
is compared to UK pounds so like I said

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
is compared to UK pounds so like I said
the<00:01:06.840> elgato<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.710> cheaper<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the elgato is a bit cheaper than the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
the elgato is a bit cheaper than the
AVerMedia<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.939> both<00:01:09.119> fronts<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> across<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
AVerMedia on both fronts on across the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.450 
AVerMedia on both fronts on across the
pond<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.830> America<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> UK<00:01:13.460> more

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pond in America and here in the UK more

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
pond in America and here in the UK more
reasons<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
reasons for this is probably because the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
reasons for this is probably because the
elgato<00:01:16.500> still<00:01:17.009> isn't<00:01:17.369> fully<00:01:17.580> portable

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
elgato still isn't fully portable

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
elgato still isn't fully portable
although<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> small<00:01:19.290> device<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.799> still

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
although it's a small device it still

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.060 
although it's a small device it still
does<00:01:20.189> need<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> pc<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> laptop<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.479> record

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
does need a pc and a laptop to record

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
does need a pc and a laptop to record
but<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> AVerMedia<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.939> record<00:01:24.210> straight

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but the AVerMedia can record straight

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359 
but the AVerMedia can record straight
onto<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.869> SD<00:01:24.960> card<00:01:25.170> obviously<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> still<00:01:26.040> need

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
onto an SD card obviously you still need

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
onto an SD card obviously you still need
to<00:01:26.400> power<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> capture<00:01:27.150> card<00:01:27.180> via<00:01:27.600> USB<00:01:28.220> but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to power the capture card via USB but

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
to power the capture card via USB but
you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.670> by<00:01:29.729> many<00:01:30.060> means<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you can do that by many means on the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
you can do that by many means on the
move<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.530> record<00:01:31.860> direct<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.490> SD

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
move but you can record direct to an SD

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.649 
move but you can record direct to an SD
card<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> elgato<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.549> 30<00:01:35.820> pounds<00:01:36.180> cheaper<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
card the elgato is 30 pounds cheaper so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
card the elgato is 30 pounds cheaper so
in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> UK<00:01:37.200> 30<00:01:37.560> pounds<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.009> quite<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> lot

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in the UK 30 pounds there's quite a lot

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
in the UK 30 pounds there's quite a lot
of<00:01:38.400> money<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.700> people<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> honest

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
like the AVerMedia the elgato is a very

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
like the AVerMedia the elgato is a very
good<00:01:45.329> device<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.200> still<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.560> favorite

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
good device and it's still my favorite

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.710 
good device and it's still my favorite
device<00:01:47.280> simply<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> software<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
device simply because the software is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.899 
device simply because the software is
extraordinary<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.399> bringing<00:01:50.579> more

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.160 
on Game Capture calm and the AVA media
for<00:01:58.619> me<00:01:58.740> has<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> price<00:01:59.399> difference<00:02:00.170> because

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
for me has the price difference because

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.980 
for me has the price difference because
it<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.409> fully<00:02:01.649> portable<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.509> has<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> higher

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it is fully portable and it has a higher

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
it is fully portable and it has a higher
recording<00:02:04.649> bitrate<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.479> get

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
recording bitrate but you have to to get

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
recording bitrate but you have to to get
the<00:02:06.899> higher<00:02:07.079> recording<00:02:07.590> bitrate<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> need<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the higher recording bitrate you need to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.089 
the higher recording bitrate you need to
plug<00:02:08.429> into<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> computer<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.410> actual<00:02:10.560> SD

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
plug into the computer the actual SD

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.260 
plug into the computer the actual SD
card<00:02:11.400> recording<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.120> rate<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.480> around<00:02:12.720> six

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
card recording bit rate is around six

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.350 
card recording bit rate is around six
megabits<00:02:13.750> per<00:02:13.810> second<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> that's<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.210> lot

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
megabits per second so that's a lot

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.890 
megabits per second so that's a lot
lower<00:02:16.540> than<00:02:17.250> recording<00:02:18.250> from<00:02:18.610> pc<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.450> example

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
lower than recording from pc for example

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.380 
lower than recording from pc for example
so<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.980> me<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.370> price<00:02:21.580> difference<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
so for me the price difference is just

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.090 
so for me the price difference is just
there<00:02:22.600> not<00:02:22.780> because<00:02:22.930> bitrate<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.530> just

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
there not because bitrate is just

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.130 
there not because bitrate is just
because<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.490> fully<00:02:24.730> portable<00:02:25.210> but<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
because it's fully portable but the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.690 
because it's fully portable but the
yellow<00:02:26.320> garter<00:02:26.590> does<00:02:27.010> save<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> bit<00:02:27.670> of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
yellow garter does save you a bit of

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.960 
yellow garter does save you a bit of
