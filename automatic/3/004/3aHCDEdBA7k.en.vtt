00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.690
 when these prices are gone for both taxes Wednesday, March 16 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.420
 2011 we have a little thought 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.570
 heavy losses accra ghana the band singer and youssef 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 then so sad sport 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.599
 but no she is not dead it was just reduced to the state 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.320
 wreck 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.310
 this beaten 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 it's another world 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 there too for the factories there do you remember the imitator of shakira 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.470
 remember james schiro he met her idol yes they even sang 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.270
 Ribery set which is the best it will be cons it would be 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.950
 useless since they have the same path 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.220
 we are really in what we know it is 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.610
 so let's talk about it 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 other stars now that you know the singer kesha who is 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.479
 always very hard today and sexy at the same time 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.479
 and we saw it yesterday on a beach in Australia 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.030
 and then some trees something sexy two years ago after the adoption of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.580
 even the position that suits him the best 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.130
 you're from the united stranded whale 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.420
 at the end of the year of the day last weekend a traveler a flight 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.120
 without francisco Saturday and must try to do the sequel to the movie snakes in 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.090
 the airplane that finally applies - in the city 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 good it's a little bit less flipper is sure to follow 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.030
 the forces in the battle for the city 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 that's why public transport is always late 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.870
 for me 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 good this is the last time the driver wants to be the voice 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.160
 it's the last time I do his homework 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.600
 after the parade of their troops on a single lane on decisions 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.969
 presidential fly 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.969
 kind why schizophrenic 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.229
 that's if you do not find 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.229
 how many people have dementia 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 the time of bank balance sheets and in reserve after seeing this video 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 several ways to kill a solution 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.430
 the agreement signed with a little bit strange but here it escapes me 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.699
 totally take the bus exactly 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.969
 15 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.349
 with lastly you may know this custom of 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.100
 footballers become their guardian when he is bad 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.560
 via this video is short all baboon babysitters what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.029
 do you attribute justice 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 why not with age 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.149
 art became a benchmark with a sitting dickens man discovered 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.630
 that putting his iphone in a hell 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.790
 to do what 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.550
 his reception was elected better pace quite well reported there is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.100
 still some boats for his accessible network explain all this on 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.580
 the computer internet which caused what we call 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.469
 commonly a bust 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.669
 enel pj and that it works and no it's not time it's happening too 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.819
 by cons is a real logical problem I can not 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.819
 you have to go that then 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.139
 al ats the problem to his head goes wrong 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.549
 further the technique 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.370
 as for the phone a few steps from the metro verdun - the team is no 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.370
 even every mention a try 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.399
 but the boy dropped the runway at the time to go 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.620
 dear I scandal bonuses 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.179
 ah yes forced departures 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.179
 as an example however far from being developed 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 visa dumpling of the day 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.969
 the bad 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.199
 she is beautiful she is easier she took place in a post office 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.969
 in the north-west of the country where a suspicious package was discovered indeed 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.920
 he was a little shy mechanical a little bit like a bomb the office of 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.180
 post after the salvage mine clearance 400 places opens the package 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.619
 and discover a lot of sextoys on the road to tahrir 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.129
 where did it go 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.789
 it is true that the noise 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.429
 It should not be confused 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.469
 demining or bomb services 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.959
 another moment the corridor could be open to the groupama bar 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.019
 as if it's been a long time since we had not 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 then the apple firm 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.999
 it happened 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.999
 all security 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.099
 for arcep it's weird 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 small formats 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.370
 3 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.920
 more and more like a pork in the US states of the day that is 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.030
 unfolds in Florida around the 30-year-old sports hall 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.380
 this decree for counterfeit tickets he tried to loot a 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.260
 restaurant with counterfeit notes but the manager noticed the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.070
 trickery 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.300
 and for good reason he had printed the help with a simple printer bought in 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.979
 a supermarket 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.270
 so this time I would not wear safe judgment at this act 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.360
 I would say 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.759
 it's a bit like the other m 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.620
 lack of dollars 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.620
 moore starts by searching and you have to learn from them 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.419
 so why as long as that side because you can not really 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.159
 the silver pampelonne beach 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.860
 olivier jérôme revon it takes no time what to save 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.389
 this laser printer 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.689
 we refer to the idea of ​​the century and a roundabout 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.689
 this concert of teachers 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.509
 I can maybe it goes back his passion for sailing 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.889
 Yes 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.220
 on the terminal today and last weekend in england we have 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.530
 invented a new sport 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.770
 ap 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.199
 the comic book football 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.199
 funeral things it works too 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.550
 cloud type public public cloud todd doggie 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.949
 I touch
