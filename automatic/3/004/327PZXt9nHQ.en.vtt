 ouattara gold 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.789
 let's go geraud portal 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.669
 At that time 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:13.649
 j 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.140
 priorities no we did it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.999
 I just hope it will be enough 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.009
 gold 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.550
 the ministerial report 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.439
 later at the end of stage three attackers did not want 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.399
 I am always at quito 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.349

 g 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.850
 the police do not have a parable from life insurance 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.520
 while Apple made it on TV where the car was 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.090
 best 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.300
 a rather rare stadium in the musical head for the cgt 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 the truth 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.830
 yes and no any student you are on the spot in jump the drug test 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.229
 that you have an elite corps of the army 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.870
 or that you are limpid left task members by class 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 this is how 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.300
 why do this business 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.340
 because we are here to help young people in need 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 like big ones 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.380
 exactly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.650
 but how to be assured 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 moreover alone 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.619
 you only have to harnessed to the number published in 2005 which is attacked a step of 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.869
 reading 20 that's a lot no and in the periphery 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100
 you feel is then immediately 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.159
 and that could stick the net loss of $ 900 a month life insurance 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.170
 who could not lose a few weeks there 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.859
 did you say she was fine 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.859
 that's exactly what i said old germany 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.490
 the policeman who is really there 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
 then no more now and you finally know the past 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.299
 you know for the employees and well 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700
 Bravo 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.190
 but then a climax 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.290
 it's north korea 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.240
 in summary 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.039
 it must not be disappointed 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.039
 with his radio a lot of time 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.059
 he is 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.209
 for many
