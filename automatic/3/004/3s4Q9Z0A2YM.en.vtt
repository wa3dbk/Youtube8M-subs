haven't really been using that lately so

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.199 
haven't really been using that lately so
then<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.950> facetune<00:03:30.489> which<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.969> an

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
then I just have facetune which is an

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.910 
then I just have facetune which is an
editing<00:03:31.780> app<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.409> don't<00:03:32.469> really<00:03:32.739> use<00:03:32.889> it

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
editing app and I don't really use it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
editing app and I don't really use it
that<00:03:33.069> much<00:03:33.189> but<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:34.150> did<00:03:34.329> cost<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.780> four

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
that much but it did cost like four

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.399 
that much but it did cost like four
dollars<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.650> figure<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.659> like<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.139> put

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
dollars so I figure to just like you put

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.839 
dollars so I figure to just like you put
on<00:03:38.530> my<00:03:38.650> phone<00:03:38.829> instead<00:03:39.159> of<00:03:39.219> deleting<00:03:39.730> it

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849
