so<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> area<00:00:07.440> model<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:08.010> rectangular<00:00:08.550> model

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
so the area model or rectangular model

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
so the area model or rectangular model
also<00:00:10.379> works<00:00:10.590> for

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
also works for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.700 
also works for
your<00:00:11.280> problems<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.120> standard<00:00:12.690> calls<00:00:13.469> for

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
your problems the standard calls for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890 
your problems the standard calls for
students<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> multiply<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.209> four<00:00:15.420> digit<00:00:15.780> by

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
students to multiply up to four digit by

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.350 
students to multiply up to four digit by
one<00:00:16.139> digit<00:00:16.400> numbers<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> an

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
one digit numbers and so this is an

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.240 
one digit numbers and so this is an
example<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> four<00:00:19.259> digit<00:00:19.380> by<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:20.009> digit

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
example of a four digit by a one digit

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
example of a four digit by a one digit
so<00:00:21.000> still<00:00:21.270> you're<00:00:21.450> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> break<00:00:21.960> your

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
so still you're going to break your

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.950 
so still you're going to break your
rectangle<00:00:22.830> into<00:00:23.369> parts<00:00:24.090> based<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> place

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
rectangle into parts based on the place

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.490 
rectangle into parts based on the place
value<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:26.189> number<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.720> since<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.289> have

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
value of the number and so since I have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
value of the number and so since I have
thousands<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.210> break<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.869> into

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
thousands I'm going to break it into

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.910 
thousands I'm going to break it into
four<00:00:31.790> sections<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.510> show<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:34.500> partial

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
four sections to show my partial

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.210 
four sections to show my partial
products<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.519> multiply<00:00:36.150> so<00:00:36.900> this<00:00:37.680> section

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
products as I multiply so this section

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.979 
products as I multiply so this section
when<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.550> breaking<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.000> number<00:00:39.330> apart<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
when I'm breaking this number apart is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.610 
when I'm breaking this number apart is
going<00:00:40.199> to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.559> three<00:00:41.070> thousand<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.590> then<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
going to be three thousand and then I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to be three thousand and then I
have<00:00:44.629> 600<00:00:47.329> plus<00:00:48.329> 90<00:00:48.989> plus<00:00:49.620> seven<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.700> I'm

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
have 600 plus 90 plus seven so I'm

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819 
have 600 plus 90 plus seven so I'm
really<00:00:50.969> taking<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> expanded<00:00:52.350> form<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
really taking the expanded form of the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
really taking the expanded form of the
number<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.399> writing<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> across<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> top<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
number and writing it across the top of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
number and writing it across the top of
the<00:00:54.870> rectangle<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.520> gonna

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the rectangle then on the side I'm gonna

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
the rectangle then on the side I'm gonna
write<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.940> other<00:00:57.120> factor<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> four<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
write my other factor of four so that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
write my other factor of four so that
I'll<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.680> able<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> keep<00:00:59.219> track<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.239> in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
I'll be able to keep track as I go so in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
I'll be able to keep track as I go so in
the<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.170> box<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.739> gonna<00:01:01.829> multiply<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the first box I'm gonna multiply the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.600 
the first box I'm gonna multiply the
three<00:01:03.059> thousand<00:01:03.830> times<00:01:04.830> four<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:07.610> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
three thousand times four and that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.560 
three thousand times four and that
partial<00:01:09.030> product<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> twelve<00:01:09.869> thousand<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
partial product is twelve thousand and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
partial product is twelve thousand and
then<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.960> next<00:01:13.229> box<00:01:13.440> I'm<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.740> multiply<00:01:14.000> 600

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
then the next box I'm gonna multiply 600

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.710 
then the next box I'm gonna multiply 600
times<00:01:15.810> four<00:01:16.580> which<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:18.060> thousand<00:01:18.509> four

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
times four which is two thousand four

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.710 
times four which is two thousand four
hundred<00:01:19.849> and<00:01:20.849> then<00:01:20.940> ninety<00:01:21.619> times<00:01:22.619> four<00:01:22.979> which

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
hundred and then ninety times four which

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.460 
hundred and then ninety times four which
is<00:01:24.720> three<00:01:24.780> hundred<00:01:25.289> sixty<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:27.140> seven<00:01:28.140> times

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is three hundred sixty and seven times

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.540 
is three hundred sixty and seven times
four<00:01:28.830> which<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:30.119> 28<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.800> then<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.039> just<00:01:32.069> need<00:01:32.429> to

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
four which is 28 so then I just need to

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.940 
four which is 28 so then I just need to
add<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.840> partial<00:01:34.080> products<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:34.890> I'm

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
add all of the partial products and I'm

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.139 
add all of the partial products and I'm
going<00:01:35.099> to<00:01:35.160> do<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.640> below<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
going to do that down below the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.570 
going to do that down below the
rectangle<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.649> can<00:01:37.860> show<00:01:38.069> all<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.459> that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
rectangle so that I can show all of that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.270 
rectangle so that I can show all of that
again

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:58.250 

and<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.610> answer<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:51.530> 14700<00:01:52.530> 88<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:58.110> can

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
and then my answer is 14700 88 you can

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.530 
and then my answer is 14700 88 you can
also<00:01:58.470> use<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> method<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> two<00:02:00.090> digit<00:02:00.300> by

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
also use this method for a two digit by

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870 
also use this method for a two digit by
two<00:02:00.600> digit<00:02:01.020> number<00:02:01.350> multiplication<00:02:02.160> which<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
two digit number multiplication which is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.320 
two digit number multiplication which is
what<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:05.070> standard<00:02:05.460> calls<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.790> students<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
what the standard calls for students to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.870 
what the standard calls for students to
be<00:02:06.450> able<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.690> do<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:08.190> I'll<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.550> work<00:02:08.729> an

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
be able to do so I'll just work an

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.330 
be able to do so I'll just work an
example<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:10.050> two<00:02:10.410> digit<00:02:10.560> by<00:02:10.830> two<00:02:10.890> digit

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
example of a two digit by two digit

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.580 
example of a two digit by two digit
multiplication<00:02:11.580> problem<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.500> let's<00:02:13.740> do<00:02:13.920> 25

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
multiplication problem so let's do 25

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.970 
multiplication problem so let's do 25
times<00:02:16.590> 12<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.650> I'm

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
times 12 and in this because I'm

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830 
times 12 and in this because I'm
splitting<00:02:20.400> both<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.700> my<00:02:20.820> factors<00:02:21.210> into<00:02:21.600> tens

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
splitting both of my factors into tens

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.610 
splitting both of my factors into tens
and<00:02:22.020> ones<00:02:22.260> I'm<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> need<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.620> two-by-two

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and ones I'm going to need a two-by-two

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.770 
and ones I'm going to need a two-by-two
rectangle<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> break

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
rectangle and then I'm going to break

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440 
rectangle and then I'm going to break
apart<00:02:30.810> each<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.890> my<00:02:32.010> numbers<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:33.030> gonna<00:02:33.240> do

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
apart each of my numbers so I'm gonna do

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.770 
apart each of my numbers so I'm gonna do
25<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.670> 20<00:02:36.200> plus<00:02:37.200> 5<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.490> I'm<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.850> do<00:02:39.000> 12<00:02:39.360> as

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
25 as 20 plus 5 and I'm gonna do 12 as

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.050 
25 as 20 plus 5 and I'm gonna do 12 as
10<00:02:40.970> plus<00:02:41.970> 2<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.830> multiply

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
10 plus 2 and then I'm going to multiply

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.240 
10 plus 2 and then I'm going to multiply
each<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> sections<00:02:45.990> by<00:02:46.320> place<00:02:46.590> value<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
each of the sections by place value so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.130 
each of the sections by place value so
I'm<00:02:47.490> breaking<00:02:47.850> apart<00:02:47.940> into<00:02:48.300> partial<00:02:48.720> products

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I'm breaking apart into partial products

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.970 
I'm breaking apart into partial products
so<00:02:49.260> 10<00:02:49.500> times<00:02:49.709> 20<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:52.610> 200<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.620> then<00:02:55.620> 2<00:02:55.950> times

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so 10 times 20 is 200 and then 2 times

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.360 
so 10 times 20 is 200 and then 2 times
20<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:58.790> 40<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.170> then<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.380> 10<00:03:01.650> times<00:03:01.950> 5

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.390 

which<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.580> 50<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.410> 2<00:03:07.650> times<00:03:08.130> 5<00:03:10.400> which

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
which is 50 and I have 2 times 5 which

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.440 
which is 50 and I have 2 times 5 which
is<00:03:11.430> 10<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.330> then<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.470> add<00:03:13.700> again<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.150> my

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
is 10 and then if I add again all of my

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.920 
is 10 and then if I add again all of my
partial<00:03:15.720> products<00:03:16.940> 200<00:03:17.940> plus<00:03:18.209> 40<00:03:18.660> plus<00:03:19.520> 50

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
partial products 200 plus 40 plus 50

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:29.000 
partial products 200 plus 40 plus 50
plus<00:03:21.930> 10<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.540> 300<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:26.430> my<00:03:26.640> answer
