00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
 Turkish süper lig in 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 more precisely, the game Karabükspor 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269
 Let's take a look at the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.410
 table 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 there we see Karabükspor I have to look 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.950
 where I think because the people of 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.800
 Karabag are on the thirteenth place 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 have 34 points galatasaray 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.160

 lost three times in a draw 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 and could only win once and that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.229
 on the first four against kayserispor 29 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.500

 best for the people of galatasary 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.980
 scorer at karabükspor parlak with 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.270
 istanbul yilmaz with 1818 season hits 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.590
 already exciting in the game against real not 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.560
 There was a yellow there 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 lock down and bono twelve hits 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.440

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.880
 drogba with 3 hits also successful 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.890
 been with a nice hook goal 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.020
 against real also the other new access 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.220
 Wesley Sneijder had a goal against Real 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.120
 madrid scores in the form table 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.600
 Galatasaray in second place 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.040
 Karabükspor on the sixteenth place 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.690
 and if you look at the season times 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.340
 look then you see except for the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.860
 first two games was galatasaray 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 always table leader so to speak now 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.230
 from the third to the 28th day of play constantly 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.239
 the top of the table settled the team 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.780
 by fatih terim the home team 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.090
 Karabükspor with an up and down in 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.370
 this season 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.000
 in between, they were even up 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.950
 the sixth place had to be back then 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.870
 now a descent were 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.580
 in between over fifteen and are 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.310
 now the last two days of play 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.470
 That 's why 13 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.180
 conclusion my tip I think that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.870
 galatasaray will do that but it will 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.100
 not clear 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.070
 sometimes something difficult in the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.440
 That's why I think superleague 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.239
 scores 21 or maybe 2 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.840
 0 for the team of galatasaray 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.840
 Istanbul
