00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
for slightly wider rims not only because

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.290 
for slightly wider rims not only because
I<00:00:23.830> think<00:00:23.890> is<00:00:24.130> kinetically<00:00:24.580> they<00:00:24.760> look<00:00:24.970> much

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
I think is kinetically they look much

it today and it's got right offside
which<00:00:48.530> she<00:00:48.680> could<00:00:48.860> be<00:00:48.949> either<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.220> front<00:00:49.340> or

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
if you're driving him Britain I'm on the

if you're driving him Britain I'm on the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
right side of the car and then itself

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.630 
right side of the car and then itself
it's<00:00:54.050> got<00:00:54.140> undo<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.800> an<00:00:54.890> arrow<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:55.370> obviously

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
it's got undo and an arrow so obviously

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.860 
it's got undo and an arrow so obviously
if<00:00:55.730> you're<00:00:55.820> not<00:00:55.940> doing<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.510> follow<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
if you're not doing it you follow the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.840 
if you're not doing it you follow the
arrow<00:00:57.019> if<00:00:57.500> you're<00:00:57.650> tightening<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.070> up<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.699> go

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
arrow if you're tightening it up you go

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.469 
arrow if you're tightening it up you go
the<00:00:59.000> opposite<00:00:59.360> way<00:00:59.420> around<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.739> then<00:01:01.479> all

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
the opposite way around and then all

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.859 
the opposite way around and then all
that<00:01:02.629> happens<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.280> grease<00:01:04.729> up<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.059> hub<00:01:05.420> in

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
that happens is you grease up the hub in

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.880 
that happens is you grease up the hub in
preparation<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:06.830> then<00:01:07.390> one<00:01:08.390> ended<00:01:08.690> on<00:01:08.890> this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
preparation and then one ended on this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.430 
preparation and then one ended on this
is<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.340> much<00:01:10.550> easier<00:01:10.820> than<00:01:11.690> putting<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.110> all

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
is so much easier than putting on all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.749 
is so much easier than putting on all
those<00:01:13.479> bolts<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.750> conventional<00:01:15.259> wheel

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
those bolts on the conventional wheel

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.680 
those bolts on the conventional wheel
tighten<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.850> up<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:19.149> do<00:01:20.149> that<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.450> then<00:01:20.600> you

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
tighten it up so do that and then you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.850 
tighten it up so do that and then you
need<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.929> hide<00:01:21.140> hammer<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:23.270> belt<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:26.860> depends

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
need to hide hammer to belt it depends

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:43.200 
need to hide hammer to belt it depends
on<00:01:27.950> how<00:01:40.960> searched<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.170> day<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.530> three<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.979> go

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
on how searched one day and three to go

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.520 
on how searched one day and three to go
well<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.509> even<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.810> moment<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.290> truth

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
well this is even the moment of truth

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.230 
well this is even the moment of truth
I'm<00:01:45.770> about<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.159> put<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.399> card<00:01:46.640> back<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.090> its

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
I'm about to put the card back on its

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:16.199 
I'm about to put the card back on its
wheels<00:01:47.479> for<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.840> first<00:01:48.079> time<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:48.619> six<00:01:49.100> months
