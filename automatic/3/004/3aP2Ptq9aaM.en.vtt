dropped<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> dropper<00:00:24.830> looks<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
dropped in with a dropper looks kind of

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
dropped in with a dropper looks kind of
like<00:00:27.800> blisters

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like blisters

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
now I dropped it in while it was wet
though<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.189> created<00:00:32.550> those<00:00:32.880> sty

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
though and that's what created those sty

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
though and that's what created those sty
raishin<00:00:33.780> patterns<00:00:34.969> these<00:00:35.969> ones<00:00:36.680> no<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.399> were

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
raishin patterns these ones no they were

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
raishin patterns these ones no they were
all<00:00:38.670> dropped<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> while<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.690> pretty

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
all dropped in while I was still pretty

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.279 
all dropped in while I was still pretty
wet<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.200> doesn't<00:00:40.469> move<00:00:40.649> very<00:00:40.710> far

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.189 

yeah<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.469> rubbing<00:00:45.739> alcohol<00:00:47.050> regardless<00:00:48.050> of

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
yeah the rubbing alcohol regardless of

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.020 
yeah the rubbing alcohol regardless of
whether<00:00:48.379> is<00:00:48.589> wet<00:00:48.800> or<00:00:48.980> dry<00:00:49.190> when<00:00:49.519> it's<00:00:49.670> that's

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
whether is wet or dry when it's that's

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.810 
whether is wet or dry when it's that's
dropped<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.780> with<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.019> dropper<00:00:51.469> once<00:00:52.339> again<00:00:52.609> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
dropped in with a dropper once again I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.290 
dropped in with a dropper once again I
want<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.120> try<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.329> spray<00:00:53.600> bottle<00:00:53.809> but<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.500> just

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
want to try a spray bottle but it just

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.170 
want to try a spray bottle but it just
moves<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.539> pigment<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.609> circle<00:00:58.609> where<00:00:59.059> it

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
moves the pigment in a circle where it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.270 
moves the pigment in a circle where it
is<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.690> it's<00:01:00.229> kind<00:01:00.409> of<00:01:00.440> neat<00:01:00.589> probably<00:01:01.339> useful

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.760 

the<00:01:05.030> watercolor<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.810> pretty<00:01:06.080> cool<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.680> I

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
the watercolor was pretty cool and I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.050 
the watercolor was pretty cool and I
think<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.070> has<00:01:07.250> something<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.610> do<00:01:07.820> with<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
think this has something to do with the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.870 
think this has something to do with the
Veridian<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.050> way<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.520> Veridian<00:01:10.520> dries

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
Veridian and the way that Veridian dries

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.130 
Veridian and the way that Veridian dries
almost<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:11.630> plates<00:01:13.180> like<00:01:14.180> slate<00:01:14.630> plates

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
almost like plates like slate plates

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.320 
almost like plates like slate plates
that<00:01:15.530> move<00:01:16.130> over<00:01:16.760> top<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.030> one<00:01:17.180> another

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
that move over top of one another

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.810 
that move over top of one another
because<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.020> dried<00:01:18.410> really<00:01:19.870> dry<00:01:20.870> sty<00:01:21.560> rated<00:01:21.980> it

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
because it dried really dry sty rated it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.250 
because it dried really dry sty rated it
was<00:01:23.030> really<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:24.730> don't<00:01:25.730> know<00:01:25.940> rocky<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.780> looks
