wide spacing here - look one of the
basic<00:01:18.950> problems<00:01:19.160> when<00:01:19.610> marking<00:01:20.210> University

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
basic problems when marking University

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.250 
basic problems when marking University
work<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.590> having<00:01:21.950> some<00:01:22.400> some<00:01:23.060> space<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.930> order

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
work is having some some space in order

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.670 
work is having some some space in order
to<00:01:24.380> write<00:01:24.530> comments<00:01:25.240> if<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.600> line<00:01:26.810> spacing<00:01:27.350> is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
to write comments if the line spacing is

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.490 
to write comments if the line spacing is
just<00:01:27.980> one<00:01:28.340> line<00:01:28.810> then<00:01:29.810> there's<00:01:30.080> no<00:01:30.230> room<00:01:30.470> to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
just one line then there's no room to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.750 
just one line then there's no room to
write<00:01:30.860> any<00:01:31.070> comments<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:33.260> this<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.190> problem

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
write any comments so this is a problem

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.630 
write any comments so this is a problem
for<00:01:34.790> me<00:01:36.310> therefore<00:01:38.500> don't<00:01:39.500> use<00:01:39.800> single<00:01:40.430> line

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
for me therefore don't use single line

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.820 
for me therefore don't use single line
spacing<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.450> instead<00:01:41.870> use<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.650> half

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
spacing and instead use one and a half

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.870 
spacing and instead use one and a half
line<00:01:43.700> spacing<00:01:45.010> it's<00:01:46.010> not<00:01:46.160> only<00:01:46.340> easier<00:01:46.820> to

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
line spacing it's not only easier to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.500 
line spacing it's not only easier to
read<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.630> allows<00:01:48.580> space<00:01:49.580> for<00:01:49.940> occasional

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
read but allows space for occasional

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.280 
read but allows space for occasional
comments<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:53.210> next<00:01:53.600> thing<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:54.340> do<00:01:55.340> not<00:01:55.670> use

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
comments the next thing is do not use

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.210 
comments the next thing is do not use
complicated<00:01:57.290> fonts

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
