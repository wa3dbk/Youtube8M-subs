00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.930 

moved<00:03:48.080> around<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.160> like<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.460> objects

you've got that to look forward to every
now<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.130> then<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.340> kind<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.640> treat<00:03:55.940> you

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
now and then it's kind of a treat you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.820 
now and then it's kind of a treat you
know<00:03:56.270> it's<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.600> just<00:03:56.750> hit<00:03:57.050> an<00:03:57.140> object<00:03:57.260> scene

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
know it's not just hit an object scene

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.760 
know it's not just hit an object scene
after<00:03:58.040> scene<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:59.420> interestingly<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.620> game

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
after scene but interestingly the game

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.920 
after scene but interestingly the game
also<00:04:00.980> gives<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.520> choice<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:02.600> playing

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.380 
also gives you the choice of playing
mahjong<00:04:03.230> solitaire<00:04:04.040> instead<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.970> doing<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
mahjong solitaire instead of doing the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.200 
mahjong solitaire instead of doing the
hidden<00:04:05.600> object<00:04:05.990> seen<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:10.340> if<00:04:10.490> you<00:04:10.610> prefer

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
hidden object seen so if you prefer

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.470 
hidden object seen so if you prefer
mahjong<00:04:11.630> solitaire<00:04:12.170> as<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:14.570> kind<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.800> myself

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
mahjong solitaire as I kind of do myself

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.870 
mahjong solitaire as I kind of do myself
then<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:18.020> can<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.350> jump<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:18.799> here<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.220> do

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
then you can just jump in here and do

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.290 
then you can just jump in here and do
this<00:04:20.090> instead<00:04:21.580> mahjong<00:04:22.580> scenes<00:04:22.910> aren't<00:04:23.150> too
