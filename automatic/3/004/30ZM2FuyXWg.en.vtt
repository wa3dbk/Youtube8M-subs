sticker I got it from a local company I
don't<00:00:28.310> give<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.460> free<00:00:29.789> advertising<00:00:30.329> but

don't give them free advertising but
this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.169> chipset<00:00:31.560> cooler<00:00:32.540> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
this is just a little chipset cooler it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.729 
this is just a little chipset cooler it
replaces<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:35.449> you<00:00:36.449> know<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.690> stock<00:00:36.960> heatsink

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
replaces the you know the stock heatsink

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.189 
replaces the you know the stock heatsink
as<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.789> I'm<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.840> replacing

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
as you can see here I'm just replacing

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.470 
as you can see here I'm just replacing
it<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> fan<00:00:40.920> version<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.519> am<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it with a fan version I am kind of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
it with a fan version I am kind of
curious<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.019> is<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.250> ball-bearing<00:00:45.379> 12<00:00:46.379> volt<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
curious it is a ball-bearing 12 volt it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.619 
curious it is a ball-bearing 12 volt it
runs<00:00:47.519> up<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.730> 5,000<00:00:48.480> rpm<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> 6<00:00:49.140> watts

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
runs up to 5,000 rpm at 6 watts

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
runs up to 5,000 rpm at 6 watts
sorry<00:00:51.679> 0.6<00:00:52.679> Watts<00:00:53.539> does<00:00:54.539> 3.5<00:00:55.399> cubic<00:00:56.399> feet<00:00:56.730> per

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sorry 0.6 Watts does 3.5 cubic feet per

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.139 
sorry 0.6 Watts does 3.5 cubic feet per
minute<00:00:57.089> of<00:00:57.329> air<00:00:57.510> flow<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.699> it's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> copper

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
minute of air flow and it's a copper

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.600 
minute of air flow and it's a copper
heat<00:01:00.300> sink<00:01:02.059> let's<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.929> is<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.080> kit

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
heat sink let's see and this is a kit

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.359 
heat sink let's see and this is a kit
I'm<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.790> quite<00:01:06.000> sure<00:01:06.030> what's<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.660> I

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
I'm not quite sure what's in here I

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
I'm not quite sure what's in here I
believe<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> couple<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.119> heat<00:01:09.299> sinks

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
believe there's a couple of heat sinks

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.399 
believe there's a couple of heat sinks
and<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.290> fan<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.829> well<00:01:14.720> because<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.350> an

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and then a fan as well because it's an

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:27.789 
and then a fan as well because it's an
add-on<00:01:17.119> cooler<00:01:18.119> set<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:24.950> two<00:01:25.950> copper

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
add-on cooler set so we have two copper

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.139 
add-on cooler set so we have two copper
heat<00:01:28.799> sinks<00:01:29.930> actually<00:01:31.700> pretty<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.820> lookin<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
heat sinks actually pretty good lookin I

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.789 
heat sinks actually pretty good lookin I
mean<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.649> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
mean if you want you know one thing with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.639 
mean if you want you know one thing with
these<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.280> boards<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:36.649> chipset

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
these is some boards don't have chipset

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.080 
these is some boards don't have chipset
coolers<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.040> are<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.399> enough<00:01:38.520> especially

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
coolers that are good enough especially

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.569 
coolers that are good enough especially
if<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.630> overclocking

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
if you like really overclocking

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.530 
if you like really overclocking
especially<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.700> some<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> older<00:01:42.240> boards

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
especially like some of the older boards

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660 
especially like some of the older boards
or<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> cheaper<00:01:43.290> boards<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
or some of the cheaper boards so if you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
or some of the cheaper boards so if you
want<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> upgrade<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> cooling<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.719> little<00:01:45.960> bit

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
want to upgrade the cooling a little bit

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
want to upgrade the cooling a little bit
these<00:01:46.469> are<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.039> also<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.719> want

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
these are good for that also if you want

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.700 
these are good for that also if you want
to<00:01:49.020> color<00:01:49.590> coordinate<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:50.789> PC<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:52.439> known

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to color coordinate your PC I have known

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
to color coordinate your PC I have known
people<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.399> pull<00:01:53.579> off<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> their

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
people that will pull off all of their

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.870 
people that will pull off all of their
heatsink<00:01:55.079> covers<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> replace<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
heatsink covers and replace them you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.219 
heatsink covers and replace them you
know<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.119> they're<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.570> copper<00:01:57.990> theme

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
know if they're going for a copper theme

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.510 
know if they're going for a copper theme
though<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.829> replace<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.340> these

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
though you know replace them with these

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.780 
though you know replace them with these
just<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.119> looks<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.630> than<00:02:00.659> performance

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.969 

we<00:02:04.480> have<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:05.020> molex<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:08.290> pin<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:08.890> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
we have a molex to to pin but it's a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.510 
we have a molex to to pin but it's a
three<00:02:09.220> pin<00:02:09.930> adapter<00:02:12.570> there<00:02:13.570> are<00:02:13.960> two<00:02:14.710> little

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
three pin adapter there are two little

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.240 
three pin adapter there are two little
thermal<00:02:16.000> pads<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:17.880> two<00:02:18.880> push<00:02:19.630> pins<00:02:19.930> for<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
thermal pads and two push pins for the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.270 
thermal pads and two push pins for the
cooler<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:22.800> finally<00:02:23.800> we<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.040> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
cooler and then finally we have this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.810 
cooler and then finally we have this
cooler<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.470> little<00:02:26.740> bit<00:02:26.890> nicer<00:02:27.460> it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
cooler with a little bit nicer it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.400 
cooler with a little bit nicer it
actually<00:02:28.150> comes<00:02:28.330> with<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.540> little<00:02:28.570> thermal

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
actually comes with a little thermal

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.000 
actually comes with a little thermal
paste<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.540> can't<00:02:31.540> vouch<00:02:31.750> for<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:32.530> good<00:02:32.860> this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
paste I can't vouch for how good this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.090 
paste I can't vouch for how good this
thermal<00:02:33.340> paste<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.790> but<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:35.980> at<00:02:36.040> least

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
thermal paste is but you know at least

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.850 
thermal paste is but you know at least
you'll<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.400> some<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.880> buy<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.090> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
you'll have some if you buy this and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.390 
you'll have some if you buy this and
then<00:02:38.860> we<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:41.050> copper<00:02:41.680> fan<00:02:42.490> heatsink<00:02:44.400> so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
then we have the copper fan heatsink so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
then we have the copper fan heatsink so
the<00:02:46.150> obligatory<00:02:46.420> shine<00:02:46.960> test<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.380> don't<00:02:47.530> know

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the obligatory shine test I don't know

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.480 
the obligatory shine test I don't know
if<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.710> guys<00:02:47.830> will<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.040> able<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.370> this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
if you guys will be able to see this

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.400 
if you guys will be able to see this
very<00:02:48.640> well<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.660> well<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.290> see

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
very well but it is well you can see

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.930 
very well but it is well you can see
there<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> camera<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.640> pretty

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
there you can see the camera it's pretty

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.560 
there you can see the camera it's pretty
shiny<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.510> copper<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.820> looks<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
shiny for copper and it looks like the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.949 
shiny for copper and it looks like the
fans<00:02:55.780> sits<00:02:56.290> down<00:02:57.000> inside<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> heatsink

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
fans sits down inside of the heatsink

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.520 
fans sits down inside of the heatsink
itself<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:00.910> looks<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.780> know<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.200> is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
itself so it looks like you know this is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.250 
itself so it looks like you know this is
more<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.250> heat<00:03:03.430> spreader<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.570> sink<00:03:04.900> part

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
more of a heat spreader the sink part

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.199 
more of a heat spreader the sink part
the<00:03:05.620> heatsink<00:03:05.980> part<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.459> more<00:03:06.700> around<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the heatsink part is more around the

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.510 
the heatsink part is more around the
edges<00:03:07.600> here<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.500> airflow<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:08.980> gonna<00:03:09.160> suck

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
edges here and the airflow is gonna suck

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.390 
edges here and the airflow is gonna suck
down<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.330> then<00:03:10.810> come<00:03:10.989> out<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.470> ventilate

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
down in and then come out and ventilate

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.790 
down in and then come out and ventilate
the<00:03:12.489> air<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.790> way<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> anyways<00:03:14.410> that's<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
the air that way so anyways that's the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.930 
the air that way so anyways that's the
very<00:03:15.370> quick<00:03:15.700> look<00:03:15.970> at<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:17.350> van<00:03:17.560> tech<00:03:18.690> iceberg

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
very quick look at the van tech iceberg

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.830 
very quick look at the van tech iceberg
if<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.030> need<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.239> little<00:03:22.360> bit<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.660> extra

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
if you need a little bit of extra

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.820 
if you need a little bit of extra
cooling<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.380> something<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:26.500> know<00:03:26.620> my

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
cooling on something like you know my

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.009 
cooling on something like you know my
guess<00:03:27.040> was<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.280> good<00:03:27.489> place<00:03:27.730> maybe<00:03:28.600> not<00:03:28.870> this

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
guess was a good place maybe not this

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.740 
guess was a good place maybe not this
exact<00:03:29.440> board<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.280> know<00:03:30.400> something<00:03:30.850> along

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
exact board but you know something along

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.030 
exact board but you know something along
the<00:03:31.870> lines<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.200> an<00:03:32.320> all-in-one<00:03:32.620> board

something<00:03:33.910> where<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.150> want<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.360> little<00:03:34.540> better

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
something where you want a little better

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.820 
something where you want a little better
airflow<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:37.480> actually<00:03:37.900> has<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.320> chipset

cooler<00:03:39.100> across<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.459> whole<00:03:39.610> thing<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:39.940> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
cooler across the whole thing so it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.250 
cooler across the whole thing so it
probably<00:03:40.150> wouldnt<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.510> good<00:03:40.690> candidate<00:03:41.050> but

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
probably wouldnt be a good candidate but

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.780 
probably wouldnt be a good candidate but
you<00:03:41.769> know<00:03:41.860> something<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.370> where<00:03:42.700> it's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
you know something like this where it's
