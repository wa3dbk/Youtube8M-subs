00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 welcome to the instructional films of the small landscape elements more 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.010
 you have questions about the construction and maintenance of landscape elements 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 plants and pruning the trees and shrubs and beautiful and healthy remains 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 and now that I fit the rest of the environment as well as possible today, we are going to sp 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.880
 hedge plants and tracking 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.230
 a bushy hedge is saying goodbye 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 of in and placed freely growing shrub 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.179
 and not forgotten 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.789
 ans he is not mention on the windows you can plan between November and March 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:31.460
 to go 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 like any other always 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 the couple warm in winter, you can plant them between November and March 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.430
 so the morning ride can be equivalent then you can of course also just the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.590
 plants by nature of a hole in the ground the final plan too expensive and worry 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.330
 about accessibility 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.130
 In addition, there is increasingly a counterattack 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.610
 coming 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.790
 we need 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.699
 in Spain 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.630
 the public hands the cycling and so he had to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.990
 the last of the world 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.050
 okay 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.080
 was there 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.190
 actually had 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.220
 yes a ribbon for michel landscape element 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 consisting of various wild growth in the bushes ideal for example 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.850
 small mammals birds and insects and news in italy annual pruning 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.730
 that becomes and create in the rest 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.090
 but it is also wonderful to see those different colors that are green 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.140
 the doors and like our roots 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 the neighborhood by becoming n the series 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 but they did like this board would like more 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.130
 looking at the studio question from a cultural-historical point of view 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.010
 usually to try f or along the island or else unpack 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 if you have received a draft plan 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 look but that was planned to be planted 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.020
 to ensure that the success went in the directive 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.060
 you can mentally tension but dig in the holes 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.960
 or use huntsman sports party if someone has been hedging plants for longer 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 in addition, the two plants per meter can be very separate 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.229
 and so too with the ground dome or corner to come to erect where the roots 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.139
 come 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.580
 continued to be closed by the client at the schools 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.830
 sometimes more so that the roots get well in the ground 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:23.579
 gently presses the soil after planting in the first two years after the 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.579
 planting for sufficient water 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.799
 and not just a tiny bit, just a whole ditch in one go 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.859
 too much 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.769
 that status according to wereldhave 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.040
 and because it is a wild growth or this is the first six in ten years 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 nothing to do about it 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.650
 that's my heart beating 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.230
 yes and this month you can now put many places 17 centimeters 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.130
 because then we will grow the unions more, which will give them broad collateral 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.619
 the unknown man who drops off 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.629
 but is then slightly above zero points but in six years ago stood 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.870
 so good to grab 4 out 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.429
 and products from below a broad hedge 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.469
 we just have to weed those appointments and one here and there 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.669
 you can get out of that 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.059
 to make the dot 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.019
 suitcase then 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.169
 and there wait a moment I think we have given it extended 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.089
 the children are moving haag 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.569
 illuminate or lies 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.689
 that means that you consider the standard of the studio in one fell swoop 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:25.319
 with 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.829
 birthday taylor could of course also look at this 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.569
 First class leader comes out that he is too late it is therefore important to 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.200
 know how exactly on alternext there are cup of coffee to get but then 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.199
 my fought would be a few homes 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.679
 a justice spokesperson 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.889
 planting the Swiss swiss the singer of the provincial organization 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.150
 see the landscape fly
