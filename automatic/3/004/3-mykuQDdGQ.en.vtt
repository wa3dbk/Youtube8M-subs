00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.150
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.999
 this new video I want you to call from 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.650
 some is going to interest and I'm going to 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:12.450
 teach how to watch our movies or 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.450
 series on your ipad 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.770
 all we need is the ipad with 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.250
 the jailbreak and the lighting adapter asv 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:29.840
 well I explain the function of this cable 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:34.489
 it is simply to pass the photos or videos 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 from the card to the ipad simply but 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.210
 with the jailbreak let's see what 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.610
 we're going to get a lot out 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.290
 we connect the card and we wait for a 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 and as you can see, the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.360
 application of photos and in a new 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.100
 imported tab is only in photos that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 I made the inauguration of the projector 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.520
 and now we can select the ones 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.280
 we want and we can import them into the air 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.290
 that's what cable really does and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 according to the apple should not do anything 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.260
 more let's see now how with the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.070
 jailbreak 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.440
 we are going to be able to get a lot out of it 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 we need the live aid file application 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.760
 that can be found in Cydia that of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.830
 payment in four dollars that what it costs 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.420
 then you can also try it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.070
 pirate repositories but good you 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.550
 I recommend that you buy will work 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.790
 much better and for this time I'm going to 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 recommend that you use the player I have 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.440
 here vlc too but google this 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.690
 it works differently since it does not 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.869
 It works in the form of a folder and with our 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.750
 player we will be able to visualize the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.690
 whole card alright let's put them 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.330
 inside iphone 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.410
 as you see here in devices not 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.910
 recognizes the disk that would be our ipad 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.170
 and down attached to flash that would be the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.260
 sd card well then let's how to create 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.680
 a link a direct access to the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.740
 application that we want to use 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.810
 we go backwards and let's say that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.730
 follow the entire card folder 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.490
 let say 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.400
 sorry the sd card we will give the button 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.330
 edit up on the right we select 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.240
 mont 1 and down to the right in everything 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.650
 we will have an icon that we will give you and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 we will give in copy link 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.480
 we will be here to remove the edit and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.290
 now we will have to go to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 Applications 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.220
 and choose ours and you will say 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.640
 contact number I do not know which is the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.680
 application as there is a way that 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.010
 put the names below we have a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.730
 preference gear we will give 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.799
 we will go to file manager and the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.660
 eyelash I put names of applications 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.610
 we will activate it 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.760
 as you see it has changed everything we will 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.140
 enter we can leave now and now if 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.970
 put the name of the application and now 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.370
 it's much easier to get to it 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.940
 we are going to use we have said to 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.650
 over player we get into the web player 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.750
 and always to link the card or 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.380
 leave the documents has to go in the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 documents folder 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.530
 As you can see, it's empty and here 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.300
 important we will edit and in the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.030
 button down to the right as before 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.030
 we press it and we will create a link 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.950
 and see how you see has not been created much 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.920
 one then now it's going to be possible 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.380
 from the application 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.540
 get to this card let's check 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.640
 we close the file we put in audio 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.860
 player 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.770
 and now we have the mount one folder that 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.350
 it's going to be the sd card we get 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.620
 and we have the card the card say the 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.210
 zinc folder series folder 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.840
 I'm seeing and now we can 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.400
 put in and see all the chapters what 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.240
 We can sort by date the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.250
 size 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.670
 and the truth is that it works quite well and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.670
 Quick 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.860
 also have the possibility to see 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.409
 pdf text files is images it seems 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.329
 be recommend the document application 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.859
 I remind you that I play the player and not 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.750
 eating are free 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.669
 vlc also then we would put them in 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.470
 document and we would have to do what 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.260
 same as we have done in our player 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.590
 create the link copy the link of the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.810
 sd card and let's go the application 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.970
 of documents we will go to the folder of 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.670
 documents never better said and there 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.370
 we will edit and we will paste 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.610
 we will create the link and we would have it 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.199
 how are we going to see 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.189
 and here I already have it in documents amount 1 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.810
 we would have the zinc folder that are 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.979
 the photos and videos that can be 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.920
 import to see the images of these 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.990
 are the panoramas that says 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.670
 and then to see text files what 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.590
 that does not reproduce document for example 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.020
 They are punctual files that stay 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.940
 here thinking and you can not open but 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.340
