demo yeah incredibly easy to find so
that's<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> once<00:00:42.989> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that's all we do for that one so once we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's all we do for that one so once we
are<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.980> basically<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.610> agility

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
are in it it is basically a agility

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
course which is incredibly easy so let's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.130 
course which is incredibly easy so let's
do<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> agility<00:00:51.329> course<00:00:53.539> now<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> might<00:00:54.930> see

do this agility course now you might see
me<00:00:55.260> dashing<00:00:55.559> occasionally<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.480> get

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
me dashing occasionally that is to get

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
me dashing occasionally that is to get
root<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.620> over<00:00:59.010> any<00:00:59.160> rough<00:00:59.489> edges<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
root get over any rough edges on the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.569 
root get over any rough edges on the
level<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> couple<00:01:02.190> rough

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
level because there are a couple rough

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
level because there are a couple rough
edges<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> should<00:01:04.049> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
edges like that one that I should have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.969 
edges like that one that I should have
dashed<00:01:04.799> over<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> rough

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
dashed over so and this one is a rough

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.990 
dashed over so and this one is a rough
edge<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.360> slow<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> down

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
edge right there that can slow you down

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
edge right there that can slow you down
it's<00:01:15.000> better<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> try<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.290> skip<00:01:16.799> over<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's better just to try and skip over it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.980 
it's better just to try and skip over it
entirely<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.290> alas<00:01:20.930> all<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.409> go

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
entirely but alas all right there we go

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.490 
entirely but alas all right there we go
31<00:01:24.990> seconds<00:01:25.470> left<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.790> personal<00:01:27.119> best

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
rank I it could be done fairly easy and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.210 
rank I it could be done fairly easy and
fairly<00:03:26.520> quickly<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.500> yeah<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:29.040> doesn't

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
fairly quickly but yeah it doesn't

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.850 
fairly quickly but yeah it doesn't
matter<00:03:29.520> if<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.820> fail<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> little<00:03:30.540> bit<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.680> may

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
matter if you fail a little bit you may

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.330 
matter if you fail a little bit you may
only<00:03:32.040> need<00:03:32.280> an<00:03:32.580> extra<00:03:33.150> retry<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.080> think<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.160> did

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
only need an extra retry I think I did

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.890 
only need an extra retry I think I did
it<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.520> my<00:03:35.580> second<00:03:36.360> try<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.740> believe

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
it on my second try I do believe

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.000 
it on my second try I do believe
actually<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:39.990> was<00:03:40.020> when<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.230> didn't<00:03:40.530> understand

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
actually it was when I didn't understand

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.890 
actually it was when I didn't understand
the<00:03:41.130> combo<00:03:41.520> system<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.150> i<00:03:42.180> may<00:03:42.450> have<00:03:42.540> been<00:03:42.750> my

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
the combo system so i may have been my

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.440 
the combo system so i may have been my
third<00:03:43.140> or<00:03:43.320> fourth<00:03:43.620> try<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.300> once<00:03:45.300> you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
third or fourth try but once you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.540 
third or fourth try but once you
understand<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> combo<00:03:46.350> system<00:03:46.560> which<00:03:47.370> is

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
understand the combo system which is

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.610 
understand the combo system which is
basically<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.270> combo<00:03:48.690> system<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.230> devil<00:03:49.500> may

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
basically the combo system of devil may

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.430 
basically the combo system of devil may
cry<00:03:49.860> 4<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.940> you'll<00:03:51.270> get<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:52.170> was

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
cry 4 then you'll get it and that was

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.730 
cry 4 then you'll get it and that was

really<00:03:58.320> help<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.980> demo<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.640> it<00:04:00.300> will

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
really help for the demo but it will

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.560 
really help for the demo but it will
bolster<00:04:01.110> your<00:04:01.470> score<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.209> can

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.850 
bolster your score so it's so you can
pretty<00:04:03.870> much<00:04:03.930> guarantee<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.740> see<00:04:05.100> rank<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.860> it's

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
pretty much guarantee a see rank so it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.220 
pretty much guarantee a see rank so it's
better<00:04:08.130> than<00:04:08.340> doing<00:04:08.490> it<00:04:08.730> now<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.360> then<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:10.050> for

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
better than doing it now and then go for

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.760 
better than doing it now and then go for
your<00:04:10.350> little<00:04:10.790> SSS<00:04:11.790> runs<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.510> do<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.320> the
