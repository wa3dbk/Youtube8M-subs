it<00:01:38.630> well<00:01:38.929> this<00:01:39.110> race<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.530> know<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:39.800> we've

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it well this race you know we we've

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.340 
it well this race you know we we've
chose<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.729> run<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.090> standard<00:01:41.780> red<00:01:41.990> label

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
chose to run the standard red label

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.760 
chose to run the standard red label
crawler

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
crawler

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.380 
crawler
everyone<00:01:44.310> else<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> switching<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.000> different

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
everyone else is switching to different

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
everyone else is switching to different
tires<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.049> bfg<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> working<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.009> different

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
tires and bfg is working on different

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
tires and bfg is working on different
compounds<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:47.969> I've<00:01:48.479> chosen<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.229> run<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.799> tire

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
compounds but I've chosen to run a tire

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
compounds but I've chosen to run a tire
that's<00:01:50.399> proven<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> desert<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that's proven in the desert and in the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
that's proven in the desert and in the
rocks<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> bfg<00:01:54.210> crawler<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
rocks and I think with the bfg crawler I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
rocks and I think with the bfg crawler I
can<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> car<00:01:55.799> from<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> front<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.299> me

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can get the car from the front or for me

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.059 
can get the car from the front or for me
I<00:01:57.450> look<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.929> everything<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.799> know<00:01:58.890> the

to win and you know if it's going to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.589 
to win and you know if it's going to
involve<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.380> around<00:02:19.680> somebody<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.190> mean<00:02:20.599> for

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
involve going around somebody I mean for

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.199 
involve going around somebody I mean for
me<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.810> winch<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.519> part<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
me to winch is not really part of the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479 
me to winch is not really part of the
game<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.660> gotta<00:02:25.079> make<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.470> by<00:02:25.620> myself<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
game I gotta make it by myself and I

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.390 
game I gotta make it by myself and I
think<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.540> make<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.720> pretty<00:02:28.200> much<00:02:28.440> taking

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
think I can make it pretty much taking

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.370 
think I can make it pretty much taking
the<00:02:29.489> time<00:02:29.700> focusing<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> rocks<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.019> you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
the time focusing on the rocks is you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
the time focusing on the rocks is you
know<00:02:31.500> focusing<00:02:32.069> on<00:02:32.190> where<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.549> going<00:02:32.849> before

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
know focusing on where I'm going before

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.449 
know focusing on where I'm going before
youth<00:02:33.329> in<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> situation<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.040> by

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
youth in a situation you know I think by

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.890 
youth in a situation you know I think by
the<00:02:35.519> rocks<00:02:35.849> way<00:02:36.150> they<00:02:36.329> have<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> course<00:02:36.660> laid

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the rocks way they have of course laid

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
the rocks way they have of course laid
out<00:02:36.989> by<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> time<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.950> gnarly

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
out by the time we get to the gnarly

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
out by the time we get to the gnarly
rocks<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.450> spread<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.720> you

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
rocks it's going to be spread out you

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.690 
rocks it's going to be spread out you
know<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.260> might<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.769> might<00:02:41.130> see<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> guy

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
know there might be you might see a guy

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.819 
know there might be you might see a guy
or<00:02:41.849> two<00:02:41.879> but<00:02:42.239> by<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.959> time<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.440> get<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> mile

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
or two but by the time we get to mile

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.530 
or two but by the time we get to mile
marker<00:02:44.160> hundred<00:02:44.519> i<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.150> that's<00:02:45.299> when<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
marker hundred i think that's when the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.699 
marker hundred i think that's when the
race<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.049> start<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.530> that's

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
race is going to start because that's

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.289 
race is going to start because that's
when<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> big<00:02:47.129> obstacles<00:02:47.700> are<00:02:47.850> but<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
when the big obstacles are but at the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.720 
when the big obstacles are but at the
same<00:02:48.480> point<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.109> you're<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.410> there<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
same point if you're not there in the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.460 
same point if you're not there in the
front<00:02:50.940> you're<00:02:51.630> not<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.109> winning<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
front you're not going to be winning the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.590 
front you're not going to be winning the
race
