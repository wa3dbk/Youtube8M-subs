matte<00:01:27.479> finish<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.530> goes<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> long<00:01:28.979> way

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
matte finish a little goes a long way

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120 
matte finish a little goes a long way
it's<00:01:30.210> pretty<00:01:30.630> buildable<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.829> satisfied

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
it's pretty buildable and I'm satisfied
with<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.700> coverage<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> said

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
with the coverage because like I said

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.260 
with the coverage because like I said
it's<00:01:34.650> medium<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> still<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.909> skin

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.880 
it's medium you can still see your skin
through<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> still<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.259> natural<00:01:37.560> I'm

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
through it so it still looks natural I'm

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.620

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I hooked on Pro Longwear concealer but

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
I hooked on Pro Longwear concealer but
the<00:01:42.030> coverage<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.259> high<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:44.310> me

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the coverage is just so high from me

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
the coverage is just so high from me
that<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.299> doesn't<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.780> natural

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that it just doesn't look natural

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
that it just doesn't look natural
because<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.680> wear<00:01:46.829> foundation<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.549> over
