they're<00:00:41.790> relatively<00:00:42.600> inexpensive<00:00:43.550> now<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
they're relatively inexpensive now the I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
they're relatively inexpensive now the I
think<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.350> reason<00:00:46.620> why<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> people

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
think the reason why a lot of people

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.680 
think the reason why a lot of people
don't<00:00:47.520> make<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.239> home<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.570> because

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
don't make these at home is because

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
don't make these at home is because
they're<00:00:49.079> scared<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.890> dealing<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.670> fresh

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
they're scared of dealing with the fresh

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
they're scared of dealing with the fresh
mussels<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.469> always<00:00:52.649> read<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
mussels and and you always read the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
mussels and and you always read the
words<00:00:53.399> de<00:00:53.699> beard<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
words de beard and all that kind of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.279 
words de beard and all that kind of
stuff

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
stuff

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.139 
stuff
so<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.980> preparation<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> mussels<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
so the preparation of the mussels is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
so the preparation of the mussels is
actually<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.629> important<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.579> that's<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
actually very important and that's the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
actually very important and that's the
thing<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.320> always

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
thing that I think is always

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
thing that I think is always
intimidating<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.489> people<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.820> how<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
intimidating for people so how do you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
intimidating for people so how do you
how<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> prepare<00:01:04.409> mussels<00:01:05.040> fresh<00:01:05.220> messes
