00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.160
 video I want you the tripod 160th 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 imagine a body 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.460
 this is a professional tripod with 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.980
 That means a floyd- muffled head 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 you can be very relaxed kameraschwenks 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.950
 So perform well for 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.369
 video recordings suitable I come now 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.079
 First of all, see the details below 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.750
 There we have one for example 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:45.589
 maximum from the height of 1,600 10 mm 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.390
 or a minimum of 435 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:52.949
 millimeters 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 then we have a height of 615 mm 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.140
 when the tripod stops folded 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.470
 is and have a diameter of 26 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 millimeters 5 kilograms can be there 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.380
 maximum on top 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.830
 that means you can already big 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.300
 Camera is attached to it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 the whole is then just under two kilos 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.340
 and that's just how it was 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.840
 first make the outer more 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 Interestingly made in China like many things 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.890
 another is down there at the barcode 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 what's in the package there is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 once a cloth bag more or 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 less plastic of course 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.640
 the already processed a bit higher quality 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.380
 irritates the bag in front of the camera tripod 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.770
 from the manufacturer hama I already 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.900
 times had presented so recognized 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 you know that this is one 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.170
 then have quality product acts 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.479
 Here's a little accessory and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.410
 then we will come here first 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 Tripod The tripod is made of aluminum like 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 already mentioned 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:21.860
 you can open it up so easily 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.980
 close and then down three times 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.830
 fail 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 that means you have of course first 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.519
 once this stage after that and at 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.910
 you can then still the third 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:38.100
 fail so then you come here too 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.500
 quickly to this place four 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.930
 they are meant for you to do that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.160
 tripod can not only open so 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.799
 but man also oppresses 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.930
 continue and then continue that way 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.410
 tripod beautiful flat on the ground 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 can 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.450
 if you want to record there 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.579
 so the most important is of course this one 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.010
 floyd muffled head that is in the 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.620
 Price also unique so that is 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.980
 really a buy recommendation 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 Something you do not get elsewhere 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.480
 head works so here i have one 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.280
 display degree indicator can solve this and 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.519
 can now easily with broad 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.040
 Resistance is there of course 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.220
 turn your head or if I am here 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.090
 whole turned also up and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.180
 go downstairs 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.910
 both are muted then we have too 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.070
 Here is a metal processing 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.870
 that does not work that way either 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.340
 quickly breaks down on top of it 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.530
 of course, as you already know it from 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.390
 other statues knows a basket 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.450
 tower with the normal camera to 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.720
 It is also made of metal 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.709
 Hand out and a special feature is still 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.840
 this clip closure 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.040
 if you have opened it remains first 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560
 sometimes in this position 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.380
 and only when pressed down here 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.200
 the neck will jump back as you would 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.130
 sees that means you just set the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.750
 camera a 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.390
 here is also a second one 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.430
 special feature that goes in all directions 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.830
 so you can fix them so that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.690
 is very important to her at the camera 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.000
 can do that on the camera on it 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.549
 then the battery compartment can also 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.590
 can be used in the canon models 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.640
 So that can then be increased 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.500
 and if you have an external one 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.690
 want to connect power 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.690
 that very useful so pure you press 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.650
 down came summer rain and then can 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.169
 you secure it normally 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.000
 that 's just so much for the tripod it 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.250
 is really just a buy recommendation 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.290
 in the video area but also in the photo area 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.030
 Of course, this tripod is very suitable 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.860
 Well 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.570
 one last thing to stability 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.340
 down here you can weigh one more 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 dranhÃ¤ngen there is still such a 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.760
 hook he is also included 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.010
 I've now extended once here 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.169
 thus more freedom of movement for the 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.390
 mobile phone and nat 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.300
 but it is also very useful so 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.800
 very stable city 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.100
 Steadfast if you just hold this weight 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.000
 Anything hangs inside and so does it 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.150
 very well equipped whatever was there 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.860
 is this spirit level here 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.390
 there are several places but that is 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.790
 nothing new that there is at 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.320
 cheap only the angel 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.620
 I hope the video has been noticed 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.729
 do not forget subscribe and until 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.729
 next time bye
