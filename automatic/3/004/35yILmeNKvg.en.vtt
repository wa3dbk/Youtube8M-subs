00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
they finished roll engine even though

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.160 
they finished roll engine even though
it's<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.910> stance<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.450> could<00:03:43.630> use<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> during

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
it's a stance and I could use it during

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.789 
it's a stance and I could use it during
it<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.620> AI<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.630> less<00:03:48.269> than<00:03:49.269> intelligent<00:03:50.019> so

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
it the AI is less than intelligent so

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.819 
it the AI is less than intelligent so
its<00:03:51.720> artificially<00:03:52.720> less<00:03:52.989> than<00:03:53.230> intelligence

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
its artificially less than intelligence

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.870 
its artificially less than intelligence
and<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:58.030> yeah<00:03:59.160> whenever<00:04:00.160> they<00:04:00.430> use<00:04:00.610> troll

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
unguent you know right after that

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.259 
unguent you know right after that
they're<00:04:02.320> going<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.470> use<00:04:02.620> escape<00:04:03.060> they<00:04:04.060> might

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
they're going to use escape they might

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.270 
they're going to use escape they might
also<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.690> dodged<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.350> didn't<00:04:05.980> pay<00:04:06.070> too<00:04:06.100> much
