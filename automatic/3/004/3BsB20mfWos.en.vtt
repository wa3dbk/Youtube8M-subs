00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 how do you have the new nikon d3000 here ? 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.270
 300 the new top model of the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.990
 beginner models if you like from 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.340
 nikon 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 look forward to what has changed 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.440
 Among other things, new image sensor inside of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.020
 the 7100 and d 5300 already known 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 So look in as you have already seen 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 the cameras and you do not point in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 black and anthracite gray tone is too 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.279
 relatively smooth polished so the whole 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.810
 very nice if you fingerprints 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.949
 on that already wants about it now 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 but do not even talk about that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 colors but about the new kit 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.640
 objectively here the 18 55 mm vr 2 and what 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 especially the one with his lok 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 switch built-in for traveling 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.550
 So the whole thing is a bit smaller 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.960
 make like just under 20 mm saves the whole 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 against the old objective what you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
 So if you had it in a bag 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 sticks minimal compact otherwise 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.149
 Actually not much done when he says 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.559
 that's the newer at all nice 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.530
 Otherwise, I would say for you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 mini changes before I continue now 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 detours over the Nikon D3000 301 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 she absolutely does not deserve fast 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 continue on the subject image quality because how 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.539
 already specifically mentioned here has the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.150
 sensor of the d7000 100 respectively the 5300 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.350
 again that means 24 megapixels 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 this remained compared to the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 predecessor but now without synonymous 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 low pass filter accordingly if you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.060
 good objective of drum really have 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.560
 an excellent picture quality that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 Image noise that's actually up to iso 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.299
 1600 3200 no problem at all 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 beyond that, I would not be you anymore 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.600
 recommend to use at least 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 somehow want to print a3 or something 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.000
 but that's the way you say that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.920
 noise behavior very nice clarity 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 medium good lens really on the front 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 Excellent quality is so much there 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.829
 It has never been so little money as the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.590
 the 3,300 we come directly to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.360
 Series picture mode of the Nikon D3000 300er 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 was drilled a bit in comparison to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.299
 predecessor thanks to the now better 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 image processors with five instead of four 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.009
 images per second so we put 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 We're off to a good start 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.579
 which unfortunately is a pity that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.320
 the camera actually just under ten pictures 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.460
 a lot of memory has been heard in the case 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.020
 but now that's pretty much 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.729
 It continued because she is 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.960
 again very good with memory cards 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.479
 deal with it now already done with 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 save a relatively fast clock 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.259
 Although it is memory card once 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.460
 So if it is really fast 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.079
 memory card is the small one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.399
 Cache relatively unproblematic 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.440
 because the camera can really be almost one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.940
 friend tempo continue writing no matter if 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.500
 logic pictures or even 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 but both if you are a slow one 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.440
 had it unfortunately already after 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.490
 just under ten pictures are there 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.110
 have to after the haft otherwise as said 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.090
 very nice the series picture mode become 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.700
 in HD 3300 at least for one 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 starter the autofocus of you 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.990
 also remained in comparison to 3200 so 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.000
 Eleven autofocus measuring fields continue 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 Unfortunately, you have to slow down too 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.030
 but say with a bit of luck and 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.560
 a good objective succeeds in the front 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.600
 as well as my real luck as 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 just need to think these are 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 so the back there around are flying 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.620
 really nice just in short the whole 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 Of course, it is also in the short 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.250
 exposure time but make short 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.540
 the autofocus just small very clear 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.740
 an entry-level model in here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.880
 is also a bit lucky 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.630
 and you can do it completely 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.630
 tell many pictures 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.920
 she was with us again 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 luckily that so-called 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.940
 guide mode when i do not know anymore 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.560
 100 3200 that's what it shows 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.190
 In short, how do you guys have behind as well? 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.380
 a few things for example 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.430
 photograph guide mode beginner 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.110
 or advanced if now 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.760
 really quite very strong 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.260
 beginners are then you have here so 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.340
 some things say that and okay 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.350
 I would like to do that now 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.820
 example moving motives and the camera 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.220
 puts everything and actually everything so far 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.930
 one which is kind of important now 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.459
 we can just fell on life even 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.959
 go then really all about 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.420
 set as it should be but 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.160
 Let's go back for a moment 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.540
 into the guide mode in the same way and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.290
 then ok someday you have to have 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.400
 works with the camera 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.380
 really wanted advanced now 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.580
 deal with it and then you say 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.650
 for example, as now here is going on 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.480
 now with the portrait objectively good and 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.590
 sharp background and the camera says 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.239
 you also best which ones 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.250
 focal lengths are ideal for what you are 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.870
 because you have to adjust so you go 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.209
 ok then you have a small one right away 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.220
 Select aperture and and thus already 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.959
 and create you have set 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.840
 So you're using viewfinders now 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.100
 so great a little bit learned 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.480
 So with the guide mode really 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.739
 really good deal with the camera 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.630
 I continue to find a very nice 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.709
 thing the niefern has brought in too 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.790
 already with descriptions in it and 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.320
 At some point you are so far that you can 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.060
 Leaving the guide mode again 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.130
 with a semi-automatic and full 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.359
 manual modes so i said finds 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.010
 really good if you want to learn with 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.330
 the camera and education to go from the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.550
 Handling has not been around too much 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.720
 much changed in comparison to 3200's 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.850
 housing is also quite similar 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.200
 stayed what you generally see 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.580
 little round shape I think 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.440
 actually not bad at all 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.120
 that was relatively stylish on everyone 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.160
 fall as usual if you have the buttons 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.390
 our looks at when her 3200 my 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.919
 hand you really have one to 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.419
 Change one of the camera has 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.960
 outwardly almost nothing at all 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.090
 done 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.380
 there could really be so for now there 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.210
 also the search are somehow 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.650
 become incredibly bigger or smaller 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.470
 if he again have exact comparison 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.360
 want between 3200 and 3300 in things 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.470
 technology specification take a look 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.750
 times in the articles he rank 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.710
 have written to 3300 beautiful table 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.660
 it looks exactly the same in there 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.760
 Differences but as I said otherwise stop 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.890
 everything does not matter if display control 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.919
 whatever is one on one comparable to 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.600
 The 3200 should now be some of you 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.640
 Still say that has a whole over the 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.470
 said video mode that's true of course 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.120
 However, you have to say as I said 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.720
 same image processor same sensor 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.220
 like in the 5300 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.870
 there we have a very detailed 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.790
 video to the camera made just what 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.350
 the 50 to 60 images per second are concerned 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.490
 if you can you relish as also 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.380
 new items, quite a few finds more 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.320
 info and we also have the video for 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.260
 sigma 18 35 millimeter lens complete 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.160
 with the 3300 turned so if you too 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.810
 there is a bit more input 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.490
 want to have what the camera has on it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.930
 also looks like there once again finds 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.560
 I think you are very nice for a couple of years 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.320
 pictures 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.390
 and thus already to the conclusion of the nikon 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.980
 d3000 300 I think a lot 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.780
 successful update again from the 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.220
 entry-level series know meanwhile 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.720
 to make up for when you look at the 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.430
 1100 which looks 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.290
 that does not even have a full hd video mode 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.870
 much slower in the series picture mode 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.270
 has also dissolve much less 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.740
 So megapixel on the sensor on it 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.440
 not much light both take not much 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.670
 but just 12 to 24 megapixel sees that 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.140
 you sharpen in the image area and yet 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.300
 quite nice if you are good objectively 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.970
 So it's up to the customers like satin 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.590
 very successful the update of the 3200 if 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.780
 they already have no reason 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.160
 to update to the 3,300 if you 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.770
 turn the newcomers as he 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.680
 definitely recommend if 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.880
 you the video for nikon d3000 300 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.220
 Please have a look 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.300
 a thumb up there two more 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.330
 nice videos you can find for example 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.000
 here to the predecessor of the 3200 and here 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.169
 again to you 5300 so the higher 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.510
 model if you like 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.160
 we are back on Wednesday with the 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.310
 see you next video until then 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:41.970
 outside one had the 5300 otherwise 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:43.470
 my fresse crisis be difficult as 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.240
 already specifically mentioned the image sensor 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.570
 was taken over 11 21 so do not say 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.570
