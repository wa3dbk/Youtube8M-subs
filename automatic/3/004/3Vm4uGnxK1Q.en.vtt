 happy cheeks yesterday hb let's say the mobile 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.099
 highest in the high range 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 a brutal bestial machine with a gigahertz 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.199
 d processor 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.909
 a screen of 4 3 inches 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.970
 p a camera 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.720
 after or megapixels with double 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.460
 led flash 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.259
 a unibody mobile 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.390
 that is, one piece 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.970
 of aluminum 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.240
 percent and which is complicated what is happening a week and I'm 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.550
 very very happy 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.380
 is a hungry mobile with the experience this month 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.120
 it is also one of the few dedicated to ee 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.480
 they are supported by celis puntocom cedis de servicio web 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.640
 I dedicated 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.940
 because it allows remote control of the mobile 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.680
 and good comes with all some virtues of own applications of this center 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.560
 what can you see here 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 has interesting programs to fix 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 that are basically center discharges can not be 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810
 downloaded efe 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.910
 stronger 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 more wallpapers own scenes 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 as you see our own 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.800
 some predefined themes 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.190
 and this phase like to the esquerra 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 and three ferrari pieces after this topic we will see what we can 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 to change what until then load 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660
 p 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.990
 sound the bells alarms notifications 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.150
 here you have a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.360
 and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.380
 a history of arrests ferrando 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 nanni no doubt 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 It is very good because it adds 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 society download new things for a hundred new styles 2 designs for 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.830
 mobile 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.190
 from a centralized site 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 which makes our when it is even more fair and stable 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.360
 you see in this case as a hindrance 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 some masks 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 I do not know what they do is change the entire desktop design 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.509
 well apart from celebrating we advise that you do not accept the ex 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.299
 we are lucky that many of our friends have 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.939
 percent an android mobile transport we can receive him 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.209
 we can receive more 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.859
 recommendations from them and basically that what there is is a 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 list of the most downloaded applications and most faith 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.719
 and what else do you like 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.779
 example 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.759
 I do not know what this obligation is but 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.159
 the scientific hp type has been calculated 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.859
 Well, it can be a comment, nobody 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.189
 if you like you can not share it with social towers 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.699
 and we can be the 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.969
 the massive central market extraction 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.879
 by the way this Tuesday also 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.029
 it's already 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.369
 CD 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.379
 well let's proceed to do 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.189
 l the market already has related seems that there is a drug market 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.459
 and I can install it and that's what we're doing 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.659
 then dispatches from the iss 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 and apart astete javtokas 13 the species 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.729
 Harvesting chat cameras and was given in 720p 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.890
 and the camera application is pretty good why offer photo 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.749
 let's advocate here 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.619
 right up to john cooper 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 we passed a box with a cow 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.819
 na 3 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.359
 then slam 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.489
 of the famous aunt but also knows nobody 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.640
 added of 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.119
 an effect 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.450
 depth 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.649
 classic to a classic 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:45.749
 so 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.339
 as they say to the effect 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.949
 we visited 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.399
 how does it not smoke 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:53.289
 and we see how it looks in the photo 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:54.900
 your interest rates and 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.239
 let's not be like the photo 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.639
 min other than that 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.129
 Well, we have 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.179
 aesthetics cd 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.209
 options made the resolution when making banks 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.219
 after 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.799
 we can change quickly to relief is 170 meters we make 10% and 20% 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.809
 Well if you can not zoom 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.849
 3 turns out but we do nothing 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.779
 quality of widescreen then look we are recording posters with 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.379
 or even sinde 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.749
 and hamas processing in the camera 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.770
 how good we have percent 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.599
 then leave some images on the post 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.119
 More photos that are very difficult to understand so you can see how 

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.669
 remains 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.830
 there is also 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.930
 an own car panel different from the one of andoain 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.249
 in with 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.640
 different navigation system google maps 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.140
 that allows you to store up to 100 megabytes in maps proving how to boost 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.719
 install them 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.900
 be connected 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.080
 we have a book reader 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.199
 this case 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.520
 hosam maher 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.439
 July 1 verne 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.960
 which is basically the same that you cooperate have as an agreement today 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.300
 cars read the books 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.710
 of cook is an online store you want me to like your 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.889
 cheer up 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.289
 Messi poses fifth music buy 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.360
 six kilos of ccoo 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.369
 i consume massively say not half in English but 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.180
 is what there is in the cereals market in Spain in 50 years 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.180
 for greece to change the theme so hopefully we are given to have come down to 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.999
 hd 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.389
 quemes carabantes 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.650
 Alvarez Tesla is highlighted, we can apply 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.370
 and everything changes us 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.539
 but without losing the previous one until the end of the year because we are working 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.210
 we have bigger jump to the mail 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.229
 percent 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.469
 client of messenger fehgra cetera 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.959
 when we get home but we change and we put all josh as university and 

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.330
 these things do not 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.960
 is doing very interesting things that everyone who has two points I have not 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.610
 said but this mobile has a also two points 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.530
 percent 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.750
 that you want that you do not like what happens that is a little more advanced that comes 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.710
 default 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.720
 while the group knows how many suisse connected and boys and not interests of 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.969
 that are connected 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.749
 also respect everyone 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.219
 which is to transfer if you have another mobile with respect to the contacts you need 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.309
 that training if you're going hungry I do not want you to think about another 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.479
 phone 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:39.460
 It is very very good 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 and finally an application like firth who estimates 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:46.059
 basically 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:50.759
 a site nme are saved all the things that happen from social networks the videos 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.869
 links 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.960
 The lists 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.590
 and notifications 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.860
 these matters about if you can 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.999
 efe 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.360
 avoid 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.360
 nicol√°s to the notifications that they had 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.169
 i good 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.279
 other interesting scientists behind this fact wait 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.849
 in this case 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.849
 we can move the site desks 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.970
 I could be more 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.599
 It could be a bit slower but 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.599
 the ampa xisco functions 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:32.249
 and I think this is all six areas a and b as you can see in the post 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:34.479
 he has a brutal undertaking 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.229
 p 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.569
 that go is an experienced man who have been exposed 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.030
 It seems that this is good and a week and I am very happy of all 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.610
 he was wearing his services 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.020
 and over always those who are hungry prophets and that is a good 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.500
 a good bet for this Christmas a safe bet 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.370
 of a mobile we do not know if they have amputated and points
