 the ai says it's going quiet so 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.960
 today guys on the way for a 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.910
 new video 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.559
 so we find ourselves on that said if 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.269
 ghost for a little tutorial tips 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 tricks with a special weapon so I have 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 quickly told the little story 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.100
 in quotation marks so in fact it was 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 simple thanks to the cutter so but very 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 engine to the description it's great 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.359
 important I invite you to follow me on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.130
 twitter for anyone who would like 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.330
 play with me and that's it going to be on 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.160
 twitter that it was happening because of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.779
 time I'm disappointing obviously talking about 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 subscribers psn it was to play 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.630
 with me all that and so here is so 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 I had asked on twitter to my 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 So what subscribers misery would 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.940
 see in my next episode you 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.649
 had the choice between the owni badgers 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 the previous episode that I already did 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 and the sp 6 so there we are major was 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.410
 the previous episode I write the little 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.850
 nature that will be displayed now you 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 to go see her if you missed her 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.680
 and so here is an ego the audience at the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.300
 12 for the episode concerning FP6 so 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.430
 that's really a super rare 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 frankly at first I did not like it too much 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 too japan drums on infinity ward 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 but frankly guys I tell you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 honestly the fp if it's a weapon 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 it's super fun to play 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.040
 I do not know me for example when I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.420
 a little trouble playing as soon as I see 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 a little map like strike zone 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.580
 octane etc 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 I really advise you to go out 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.729
 with the end to get out the shotgun 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 will show you my class who use it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 and that's frankly guys play said 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 he is super pleasant brief 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.619
 so I 'm going to show you the class that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.210
 I advise you with the bazous etc 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.350
 and so it's first and foremost 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.119
 my habit I will read the comment 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.189
 which is proposed on the game so it's 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.509
 a medium- range pump mechanism 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.920
 most important damage of his 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 category so that's super important 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 it's the shotgun among the four 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 storing that there is the most 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 damage so that frankly it's a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 little more and so here I am 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.430
 personally guys the comment 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.259
 that I know about this weapon it's a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.899
 tale that would put little marker a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.670
 very good rate that is to say that the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.689
 balls follow each other quite quickly 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.250
 only negative point 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.810
 the only negative point not to give up 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 charge to a mere five bales 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.590
 it's little, but otherwise 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.380
 level of accessories I advise you 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.270
 the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.700
 fresh mouth the mouth train that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.289
 equivalent of the barrel on black ops 2 so 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.119
 to improve its reach to put a 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.530
 little less said marker I advise you 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.119
 also the front handle so the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.800
 advanced handle to stabilize the hand 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.090
 it adds a little bit of precision and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
 a few doors and so that I 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.180
 think it's a little more and so 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.590
 so here's me guys I you 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.849
 advises against by all so as to 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.080
 I usually do not like the assets are 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.849
 trophies are my precedents 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.930
 episodes sorry but there I wanted 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.580
 show because frankly I have 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.170
 found a little technique between 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.340
 quotation marks and frankly she is very 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.349
 important and I wanted you to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.489
 communicate on video 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.080
 so the trumps that I put so I 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.190
 get ready to go faster 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.140
 after a sprint 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.610
 logical so I play the pumps I put 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.959
 agility so agility that is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 the equivalent of featherweight 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.040
 I loved aimed solid to optimize my 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.709
 little refuge and I draw a lot to the judge 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.390
 and I also like a trigger 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.720
 so to aim more quickly in 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 average I loved tracker and two tracker 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.989
 it's the equivalent of lacrosse on back 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.910
 up the and the little trick is that if 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.230
 you put cracker and agility and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.670
 believe me guys are really 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.230
 a lot of damage as you go 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.090
 make types Kalck know when you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.650
 go to cros the odds of you were making 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.700
 spas laterally so when you aim 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.530
 when you move you go 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.049
 much faster with a butt than 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.600
 his and bal at the little tip talent is 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.859
 very simple is that tracker that is 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.720
 the equivalent of lacrosse 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.670
 combine with agility so featherweight 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 it's a mess is not monstrous 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.400
 goods you have decals you 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.660
 see including you shoot at 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.700
 someone you put him with marker 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.470
 hide yourself in a glitch behind a wall 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 etc. that you iron behind the wall 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
 to shoot and here you are going to arrive 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.940
 much faster and frankly 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.069
 I tell you you are going to take a lot 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.090
 plus the advantage in duel according to and half and 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.000
 so here's the little trick 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.739
 so we'll go to the sequence of the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.870
 video of the game I have a little gameplay 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.359
 condensed where I will explain all that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.769
 in video and so here and so we get 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.299
 found for the part where his enclosure 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.040
 if gameplay with the questioning 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.780
 still legal review it was the FP6 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.609
 I really hope this episode 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.690
 will have faster in the guys I'm going 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.130
 give back a little bit my point of view 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.260
 on the deck frankly you'll see 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.700
 that my very little martyr will you 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.769
 see that there in fact generic marker 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.120
 but you have to be very very very precise 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.720
 I would advise you more 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.980
 precisely from judged 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.710
 you will see that to the judge and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.550
 frankly he would put very little 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.900
 personally I do not really recommend 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.190
 to play shotgun visa pump for those 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.200
 who did not test the bridge too much 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.940
 ghost I advise you to test on 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.200
 the maps as tremor so the mark in 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.000
 question so the map where I was in his 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.870
 gameplay on males like strike zone 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 and cdma 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.500
 there is a lot of close combat in 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.910
 the part and so here is in passing 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.109
 to mutual fresh mouth on the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.430
 gameplay I did not put the handle 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.620
 that just because I thought that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.210
 if we put a plus one accessory 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.340
 lost a place for assets and 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.900
 so here is so I hope the video 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.370
 who will be more allow a small live 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.870
 if it does not hesitate to 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.760
 share with your friends to make it turn 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 to like commented to oblige me to clinton 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.040
 for a next video it was scissors 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.040
 thing 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.770
 m
