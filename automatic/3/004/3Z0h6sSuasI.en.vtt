built a big train track I actually have
two<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.399> sets<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.390> I've<00:00:39.540> combined<00:00:39.989> both

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
two of these sets so I've combined both

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.639 
two of these sets so I've combined both
boxes<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.670> made<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.329> track<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
boxes and made this one track so if you

bit smaller and as you can tell I have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.970 
bit smaller and as you can tell I have
more<00:00:50.879> train<00:00:51.210> cars<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.710> sets

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
more train cars because we have two sets

says Percy on the bottom and he's
motorized<00:01:50.890> with<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> switch<00:01:51.550> on<00:01:51.759> top<00:01:51.970> he<00:01:52.930> fits

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
motorized with the switch on top he fits

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.609 
motorized with the switch on top he fits
on<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:53.560> track<00:01:53.860> as<00:01:54.070> well<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.610> watch<00:02:00.759> him<00:02:00.970> go

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
on this track as well and watch him go

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.440 
on this track as well and watch him go
now<00:02:02.619> Percy<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.190> lot<00:02:03.430> faster<00:02:03.970> than<00:02:04.119> our<00:02:04.300> other

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
now Percy is a lot faster than our other

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.070 
now Percy is a lot faster than our other
trains<00:02:04.900> so<00:02:05.530> eventually<00:02:05.770> he's<00:02:06.070> gonna<00:02:06.250> catch<00:02:06.550> up

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

trains so eventually he's gonna catch up
let's<00:02:08.080> see<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:08.380> happens<00:02:08.739> when<00:02:08.950> he<00:02:09.040> does

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
let's see what happens when he does

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.220 
let's see what happens when he does
through<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.680> tunnel<00:02:12.070> Percy<00:02:12.489> goes<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.870> the
