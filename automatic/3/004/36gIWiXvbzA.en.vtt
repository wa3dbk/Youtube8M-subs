and I'm very happy to be here because
everybody<00:00:18.359> knows<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.020> older<00:00:19.710> model<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> SRM

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
everybody knows the older model the SRM

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.109 
everybody knows the older model the SRM
415<00:00:21.750> yeah<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.439> now<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.340> new<00:00:23.609> models<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
415 yeah and now we have new models on

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
415 yeah and now we have new models on
the<00:00:24.210> market<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> different<00:00:25.500> design

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the market with a different design

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.480 
the market with a different design
that's<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:27.029> wanted<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.570> introduce

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
that's right we wanted to introduce

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
that's right we wanted to introduce
premium<00:00:29.490> loudspeakers<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.810> incredible

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
premium loudspeakers with incredible

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
premium loudspeakers with incredible
output<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.430> want<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> make<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.000> as

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
output but we want to make them as

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.139 
output but we want to make them as
compact<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.899> possible<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.520> result<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
compact as possible and the result is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
compact as possible and the result is
the<00:00:36.540> DL<00:00:36.809> M<00:00:36.989> series<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.129> powered<00:00:38.370> loudspeakers

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the DL M series of powered loudspeakers

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.810 
the DL M series of powered loudspeakers
and<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.780> did<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.050> make<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.620> small

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
and how did we make them so small

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
and how did we make them so small
instead<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> standard<00:00:42.800> transducer<00:00:43.800> design

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
instead of a standard transducer design

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
instead of a standard transducer design
with<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> low<00:00:44.760> frequency<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.690> high

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with a low frequency and a high

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.229 
with a low frequency and a high
frequency<00:00:46.050> above<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:47.250> combined<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.969> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
frequency above it we combined them with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.500 
frequency above it we combined them with
a<00:00:49.309> coaxial<00:00:50.309> design<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.000> call<00:00:51.239> true

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
a coaxial design that we call true

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.350 
a coaxial design that we call true
source<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.530> custom<00:00:53.070> loudspeaker<00:00:54.030> design

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
source it's a custom loudspeaker design

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290 
source it's a custom loudspeaker design
that<00:00:54.989> combines<00:00:55.410> them<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.920> ass<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.940> smaller

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that combines them into ass much smaller

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
that combines them into ass much smaller
package<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.590> gives<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.190> really

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
package and this gives you two really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.630 
package and this gives you two really
cool<00:01:00.030> things<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> true<00:01:01.980> source<00:01:02.250> driver

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
cool things with the true source driver

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
cool things with the true source driver
you<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.180> incredible<00:01:03.890> intelligibility

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you get incredible intelligibility

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
you get incredible intelligibility
because<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> audio<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.390> coming<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
because that audio is coming from the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.539 
because that audio is coming from the
same<00:01:07.320> source<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.189> get

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
same source so you don't get

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.399 
same source so you don't get
interference<00:01:09.240> between<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.659> high<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> low

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
interference between the high and low

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
interference between the high and low
frequency<00:01:10.920> driver<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.390> get

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
frequency driver and then you also get

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.800 
frequency driver and then you also get
that<00:01:13.260> incredibly<00:01:13.830> small<00:01:14.280> size<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.659> can

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that incredibly small size as you can

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
that incredibly small size as you can
see<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.439> over<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> third<00:01:16.979> smaller<00:01:17.220> than

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
see there over a third smaller than

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
see there over a third smaller than
other<00:01:18.150> drivers<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.900> market<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
other drivers on the market there's a

side of that nice girl who have it up
so<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.290> all<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.490> incredible<00:02:12.490> technology

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
so with all that incredible technology

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.390 
so with all that incredible technology
in<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> transducer<00:02:14.050> we<00:02:14.620> wanted<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.190> an

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
in the transducer we wanted to do an

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.990 
in the transducer we wanted to do an
equally<00:02:16.000> incredible<00:02:16.800> set<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:18.010> built-in

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
equally incredible set of built-in

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600 
equally incredible set of built-in
features<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.560> first<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.100> all<00:02:21.160> we<00:02:21.310> wanted<00:02:21.550> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
features so first of all we wanted to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.820 
features so first of all we wanted to
give<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> couple<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.480> inputs<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.410> mic

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
give a couple of inputs we have a mic

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.060 
give a couple of inputs we have a mic
line<00:02:24.100> input<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.700> channel<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.830> XLR<00:02:26.830> or

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
line input on channel one a XLR or

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.630 
line input on channel one a XLR or
guitar<00:02:27.490> input<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.780> stereo<00:02:29.380> RCA<00:02:29.709> input<00:02:30.459> on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
guitar input and a stereo RCA input on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.050 
guitar input and a stereo RCA input on
channel<00:02:31.120> two<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.230> makes<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.980> DL<00:02:33.400> C<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:34.030> D

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
channel two so this makes the DL C or D

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.090 
channel two so this makes the DL C or D
