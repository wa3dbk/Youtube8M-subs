my dad was buying his first car and a
transmission<00:00:38.280> cost<00:00:38.579> 100<00:00:38.969> bucks<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
transmission cost 100 bucks you know you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
transmission cost 100 bucks you know you
could<00:00:39.930> afford<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> rock<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.010> of

could afford to rock it in and out of
gear<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.460> today<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.750> bad<00:00:42.960> idea<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
gear but today it's a very bad idea and

gear but today it's a very bad idea and
let<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.770> show<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> an

let me show you why this here is an

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
let me show you why this here is an
example<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.430> engine<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:47.910> transmission

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
example of an engine or transmission

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.299 
example of an engine or transmission
mount<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.100> hard

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
mount so what you have some good hard

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
mount so what you have some good hard
steel<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> bolts<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> the

steel down here and it bolts to the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
steel down here and it bolts to the
frame<00:00:52.710> these<00:00:52.949> actually<00:00:53.309> hold<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> whole

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
you step on the gas really hard you slam

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
you step on the gas really hard you slam
on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> brakes<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.699> stops<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> engine<00:01:00.420> from

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
on the brakes what stops the engine from

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
parts of this that are rubber that are
made<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.229> reduce<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> vibration<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.759> the

those parts you know they're not
designed<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.500> torque<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> just

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
designed for that kind of torque to just

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
designed for that kind of torque to just
be<00:01:29.310> ripped<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> rocked<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
be ripped and rocked like that so it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
be ripped and rocked like that so it
tears<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.860> while<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> tearing<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.990> gets

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
tears and while this is tearing it gets

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
tears and while this is tearing it gets
worse<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.040> only<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> 500<00:01:35.850> bucks<00:01:36.030> you're

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
worse it's not only the 500 bucks you're

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
worse it's not only the 500 bucks you're
gonna<00:01:36.240> spin<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> labor<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> put

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
gonna spin on this or the labor to put

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
gonna spin on this or the labor to put
it<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.909> worst<00:01:39.119> problem<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> imagine<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it in the worst problem is imagine that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
it in the worst problem is imagine that
fan<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.460> front<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> motor

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
fan you have in the front of the motor

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
fan you have in the front of the motor
imagine<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.049> happens<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> whole<00:01:43.770> motor

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
imagine what happens if the whole motor

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
imagine what happens if the whole motor
is<00:01:44.579> inside<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> box<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> fans<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.259> up

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is inside a box or the fans right up

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.830 
is inside a box or the fans right up
here<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.130> front<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> motor<00:01:48.360> shifts

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
here in front and then the motor shifts

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.990 
here in front and then the motor shifts
forward<00:01:49.350> what's<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:50.070> happen<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.850> gonna

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
forward what's gonna happen it's gonna

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760 
forward what's gonna happen it's gonna
break<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> fan<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> gonna<00:01:52.079> destroy<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
break the fan it's gonna destroy the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
break the fan it's gonna destroy the
radiator<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.460> gonna<00:01:53.549> tear<00:01:54.210> hoses<00:01:54.689> here's<00:01:55.259> an

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
radiator it's gonna tear hoses here's an

your throttle cable when you push on the
gas<00:01:59.969> right<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.840> actuates<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:02.009> see

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
gas right this is what actuates will see

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
gas right this is what actuates will see
where<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.490> yellow<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> highlighted<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.719> you

scrape<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.470> snow<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.190> dig<00:03:00.820> down<00:03:01.060> as<00:03:01.300> far

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
scrape out the snow and dig down as far

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.870 
scrape out the snow and dig down as far
as<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:02.220> once<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> get<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.550> dug<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.850> in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
as you can once you get it dug out in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
the front dig it out in the back and do

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.940 
the front dig it out in the back and do
that<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.760> both<00:03:06.940> wheels<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.470> you're<00:03:08.590> gonna<00:03:08.680> dig

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
that to both wheels so you're gonna dig

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.920 
that to both wheels so you're gonna dig
out<00:03:09.070> behind<00:03:09.370> them<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.640> you're<00:03:10.420> gonna<00:03:10.510> dig<00:03:10.780> out

out behind them and you're gonna dig out

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.990 
out behind them and you're gonna dig out
in<00:03:11.080> front<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.440> them<00:03:11.530> all<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.310> way<00:03:12.430> around<00:03:12.760> now
