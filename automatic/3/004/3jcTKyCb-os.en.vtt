tying everything back I prefer to work

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
tying everything back I prefer to work
with<00:00:33.300> wet<00:00:33.450> hair<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> tendency<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
with wet hair but there is a tendency of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
with wet hair but there is a tendency of
cutting<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:36.030> more<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.600> think

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
cutting off more than you think

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.680 
cutting off more than you think
so<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.620> sure<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.890> work<00:00:38.190> slowly<00:00:38.550> straight<00:00:39.450> bangs

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so be sure to work slowly straight bangs

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.500 
so be sure to work slowly straight bangs
can<00:00:39.989> often<00:00:40.440> widen<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:41.010> forehead<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.300> like

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
can often widen your forehead so I like

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
can often widen your forehead so I like
to<00:00:42.629> split<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.050> bangs<00:00:43.260> into<00:00:43.559> thirds<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to split my bangs into thirds where the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
to split my bangs into thirds where the
two<00:00:44.940> sections<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> side<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.050> long

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
two sections on the side will be long

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
two sections on the side will be long
and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> middle<00:00:47.340> will<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.879> short

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and the one in the middle will be short

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
and the one in the middle will be short
this<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.110> give<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> illusion<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.250> smaller

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this will give the illusion of a smaller

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.450 
this will give the illusion of a smaller
forehead<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> best<00:00:51.780> smaller<00:00:52.170> face<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
forehead and best smaller face put the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
forehead and best smaller face put the
two<00:00:53.610> sections<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> side<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
two sections on the side for now and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
two sections on the side for now and
we're<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> start<00:00:55.800> by<00:00:56.010> working<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we're going to start by working on the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
we're going to start by working on the
middle<00:00:56.969> section<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
middle section which will make up the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
middle section which will make up the
bangs<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> start<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.359> cutting<00:01:00.539> off

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
bangs I'm going to start by cutting off

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
bangs I'm going to start by cutting off
the<00:01:00.780> strands<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.469> obviously<00:01:02.100> too<00:01:02.309> long

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the strands that are obviously too long

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
the strands that are obviously too long
to<00:01:03.030> let<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.329> match<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> rest<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> hair

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to let them match the rest of the hair

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.880 
to let them match the rest of the hair
then<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.970> again<00:01:06.689> clipping<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> two

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
then I'm just again clipping the two

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
then I'm just again clipping the two
side<00:01:08.280> sections<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.750> won't<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.200> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
side sections back so they won't get in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
side sections back so they won't get in
the<00:01:10.409> wait<00:01:10.560> while<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> work<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> middle

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the wait while I work on the middle

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.440 
the wait while I work on the middle
section<00:01:15.650> I'm<00:01:16.650> sorry<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
section I'm sorry that it's really

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
section I'm sorry that it's really
difficult<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.950> working<00:01:20.369> little

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
difficult to see but I'm working little

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.999 
difficult to see but I'm working little
by<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:21.090> holding<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> vertically

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
by little holding this as a vertically

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's better to work slowly with little

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's better to work slowly with little
cuts<00:01:30.180> than<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.900> cut<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> huge<00:01:31.590> chunk<00:01:31.619> and

cutting vertically will lessen split
ends<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.520> will<00:02:06.910> also<00:02:07.390> give<00:02:07.630> your<00:02:07.750> bangs<00:02:08.020> a

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
ends and will also give your bangs a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.810 
ends and will also give your bangs a
choppy<00:02:08.590> layered<00:02:09.190> look

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
choppy layered look

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.580 
choppy layered look
versus<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.960> straight<00:02:11.380> intense<00:02:11.920> look<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
versus the straight intense look the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.590 
versus the straight intense look the
reason<00:02:14.920> why<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.100> split<00:02:15.670> my<00:02:15.700> bangs<00:02:16.030> into<00:02:16.270> thirds

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
reason why I split my bangs into thirds

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.780 
reason why I split my bangs into thirds
is<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.470> two<00:02:17.620> side<00:02:17.890> sections<00:02:18.340> can

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
is because the two side sections can

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.880 
is because the two side sections can
frame<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:19.300> face<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.840> cover<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.500> sides<00:02:20.740> of
