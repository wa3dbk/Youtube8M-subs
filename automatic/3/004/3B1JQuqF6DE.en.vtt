00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:05.760
 a good friend in studio tutorials did not point out how we can change our 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.200
 background image 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 at the time of logging into other worlds 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.589
 clearly it's exclusive for windows 7 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.589
 so do not try the world xp or view 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.859
 who expected the network while a good description of the video 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 yes bonus of entry and exit of training 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.579
 what this page will bring 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 it was about time he left him they gave him 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.790
 guide another nuance lamentan thinks 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.600
 has downloaded I see once downloaded and extracted 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.390
 Well, we opened it 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.930
 according to everyone's achieving 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.140
 But here it is 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.900
 and what we have brought 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.190
 we have double click 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.990
 iraqiya we have what would be a preview of 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.980
 how would our 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.660
 you do not have or sessions in the image to be nora allows to change is here 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.620
 why 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.710
 it is something that is done 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 as it has always been done it did not start control panel 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
 percent user accounts 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.700
 and to whom it changes 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.440
 to my sister 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.770
 and at the same time change there if not foreign 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.230
 this program is more than anything to change it as the cicada bottom 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.900
 the iam to change the background we just have to go to that lobo wolf fact 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.340
 the crime 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.050
 we would 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.640
 a folder where you have as 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.670
 recorded images of so bad image that we want 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.280
 replace 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.460
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.460
 let's see what would vote for the yes 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.659
 berkshire 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.610
 we'll see 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 an image in Mexico and Peru 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.670
 ap 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.250
 in this same 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.700
 throw doubleclick 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 we live in a window in the naval combat design 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.249
 well that it has been installed correctly background not 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.859
 terrible to accept 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.099
 and here we would be seeing how 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.799
 it would look like our 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.980
 our login now we just have to lock ourselves 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.649
 already that would be awaited 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.979
 in the next decade we start the computer the login 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.449
 we would move 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.929
 with our art our image changed 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:37.059
 the case that we want will have it again by default 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 we simply have to access the program 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.839
 we open it 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.069
 and we give you the reverse you deserve a crime 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.229
 and I would put it by default 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.389
 how it brings windows 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.389
 they will equal that would be everything I hope you liked 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.799
 a greeting thank you for having lived remembering 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 commenting if he liked it and if not also 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.179
 and nothing 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.909
 everything and until next time
