00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
different from what I expected but

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.479 
different from what I expected but
that's<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> bad<00:00:47.640> thing<00:00:47.930> when<00:00:48.930> i<00:00:49.309> when<00:00:50.309> i<00:00:50.340> was

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that's not a bad thing when i when i was

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.299 
that's not a bad thing when i when i was
listening<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> clips<00:00:51.090> online<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
listening to clips online a lot of the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
listening to clips online a lot of the
audio<00:00:53.309> clips<00:00:53.579> I've<00:00:53.730> seen<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.239> were<00:00:54.360> very

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
audio clips I've seen they were very

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
audio clips I've seen they were very
loud<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.199> cutting<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.039> afraid

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
loud and very cutting and I was afraid

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.569 
loud and very cutting and I was afraid
they<00:00:56.430> were<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> too<00:00:56.969> heavy<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
they were going to be too heavy but in

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.020 
they were going to be too heavy but in
fact<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.390> time<00:01:00.980> TRX<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.250> thinned<00:01:02.879> out

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
fact over time TRX have thinned out

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
fact over time TRX have thinned out
there<00:01:03.270> crashes<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> original

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
there crashes a bit in the original

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.800 
there crashes a bit in the original
series<00:01:05.850> i<00:01:05.970> guess<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
series i guess just to make them a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
series i guess just to make them a
little<00:01:06.869> bit<00:01:07.049> more<00:01:07.260> easier<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> play<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.060> i

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
little bit more easier to play and so i

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
little bit more easier to play and so i
guess<00:01:09.180> they're<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.049> comfortable<00:01:10.200> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
guess they're more comfortable for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.910 
guess they're more comfortable for
people<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.960> they<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> little

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
people and they actually have a little

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350 
people and they actually have a little
bit<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> darker<00:01:14.820> tone<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.240> them

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
bit of like a darker tone to them

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
bit of like a darker tone to them
believe<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.890> their

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
believe it or not for you know their

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
believe it or not for you know their
name<00:01:17.720> they<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.590> had<00:01:19.770> their<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.689> they<00:01:21.689> come

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
name they they had their very they come

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
name they they had their very they come
off<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> brilliant<00:01:22.920> crash<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.700> also

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
off like a brilliant crash but they also

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.249 
off like a brilliant crash but they also
have<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> dark<00:01:24.780> tone<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
have a little bit of a dark tone to it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.230 
have a little bit of a dark tone to it
and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and I kind of like that and I think that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
and I kind of like that and I think that
has<00:01:27.570> something<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.170> their<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.710> fact

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
has something to do with their the fact

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
has something to do with their the fact
that<00:01:29.280> they're<00:01:29.490> Turkish<00:01:30.000> made<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> Turkish

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that they're Turkish made and Turkish

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
that they're Turkish made and Turkish
made<00:01:31.409> symbols<00:01:31.799> sometimes<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
made symbols sometimes have like that I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.859 
made symbols sometimes have like that I
kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.020> mid-range<00:01:34.740> tone<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:36.540> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
