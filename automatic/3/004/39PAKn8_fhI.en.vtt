00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.970 
than ten pounds I like to stay on top of
things

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
things

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.159 
things
don't<00:04:14.549> let<00:04:15.030> 10<00:04:15.510> pounds<00:04:16.169> creep<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:16.890> on<00:04:17.130> you

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
don't let 10 pounds creep up on you

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.800 
don't let 10 pounds creep up on you
finally<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.440> word<00:04:19.769> about<00:04:19.890> hormones<00:04:20.489> be<00:04:20.970> careful

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
finally a word about hormones be careful

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.159 
finally a word about hormones be careful
with<00:04:22.169> estrogen<00:04:22.650> too<00:04:23.490> much<00:04:24.000> estrogen<00:04:24.330> can

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
with estrogen too much estrogen can

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.710 
with estrogen too much estrogen can
cause<00:04:25.229> weight<00:04:25.770> gain<00:04:26.060> estrogen<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> fat

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
cause weight gain estrogen is a fat

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.309 
cause weight gain estrogen is a fat
storage<00:04:28.560> hormone

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
storage hormone

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.159 
storage hormone
so<00:04:29.949> if<00:04:30.039> you<00:04:30.129> use<00:04:30.399> estrogen<00:04:31.089> watch<00:04:31.659> for<00:04:32.020> that

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
so if you use estrogen watch for that

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.459 
so if you use estrogen watch for that
