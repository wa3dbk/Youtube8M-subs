we got an energy drink called slap so
slap<00:00:13.259> frost<00:00:14.070> i'm<00:00:14.340> not<00:00:14.460> sure<00:00:14.580> why<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.849> really

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
slap frost i'm not sure why it really

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.939 
slap frost i'm not sure why it really
says<00:00:15.719> frost<00:00:16.049> they're<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.619> kind<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
says frost they're actually just kind of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.390 
says frost they're actually just kind of
says<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:18.080> it's<00:00:19.080> sensation<00:00:19.920> energy<00:00:20.279> i'm

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
says it it's sensation energy i'm

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
says it it's sensation energy i'm
assuming<00:00:20.640> cuz<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.090> called<00:00:21.270> slap<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
assuming cuz it's called slap and it's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
assuming cuz it's called slap and it's
slap<00:00:22.109> energy<00:00:22.529> too<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:24.980> it's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.420> multi-stage

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
slap energy too so it's a multi-stage

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
slap energy too so it's a multi-stage
energy<00:00:28.199> supplement<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.890> i'm<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.099> sure<00:00:29.310> what

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
energy supplement so i'm not sure what

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.860 
energy supplement so i'm not sure what
stages<00:00:29.939> they're<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.679> referring<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> i

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
stages they're really referring to but i

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
stages they're really referring to but i
guess<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> find<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.219> uh<00:00:35.930> here

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
guess we're about to find out so uh here

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
guess we're about to find out so uh here
we<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.170> let's<00:00:37.380> crack<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> open<00:00:38.090> slap<00:00:39.090> energy

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

energy I mean I get it I'm really

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.899 
energy I mean I get it I'm really
feeling<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> energy<00:01:47.070> already<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.790> gonna

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
feeling the energy already so I'm gonna

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
feeling the energy already so I'm gonna
give<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> week<00:01:49.009> at<00:01:50.009> seven<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.310> eight

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
I'm gonna go cop that slap energy and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
I'm gonna go cop that slap energy and
then<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> bottom<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.560> don't
