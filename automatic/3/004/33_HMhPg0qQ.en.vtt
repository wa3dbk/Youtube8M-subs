the pain in see how this case goes so
we've<00:01:57.960> got<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> standard<00:01:58.500> battery<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.009> there

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.130 

okay<00:02:02.920> good<00:02:03.310> fit<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.750> even<00:02:04.960> though<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.110> says

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140

it's<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> verizon<00:02:05.950> nexus<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.460> fits<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
it's of the verizon nexus it fits the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.249 
it's of the verizon nexus it fits the
gsm<00:02:07.149> nexus<00:02:07.479> perfectly<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:07.990> I'm<00:02:08.110> guessing

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
gsm nexus perfectly so I'm guessing
