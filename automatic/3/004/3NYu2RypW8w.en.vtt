going for now I did by all different
tins<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.840> maybe<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.979> secret<00:02:08.489> if

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
tins so maybe that's the the secret if

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.100 
tins so maybe that's the the secret if
you<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.330> tins<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:09.929> different

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you get all tins that are different

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.570 
you get all tins that are different
you'll<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.679> characters<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.400> are

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you'll get all characters that are

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880 
you'll get all characters that are
different<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.140> secret<00:02:13.349> boo

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
different so if that's the secret boo

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140 
different so if that's the secret boo
there<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> guys<00:02:14.370> go<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.000> would<00:02:15.090> be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
there you guys go I think that would be

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.270 
there you guys go I think that would be
what<00:02:15.840> makes<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> most<00:02:16.170> sense<00:02:16.410> because<00:02:17.160> why

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
what makes the most sense because why

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.590 
what makes the most sense because why
would<00:02:17.460> they<00:02:17.550> start<00:02:17.760> their<00:02:17.880> own<00:02:17.910> duplicates<00:02:18.450> in

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
would they start their own duplicates in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.970 
would they start their own duplicates in
different<00:02:18.930> tints<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> collect<00:02:19.890> all

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
different tints so then to collect all

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
different tints so then to collect all
the<00:02:20.100> tins<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.520> would<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the tins you would you have to get a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.850 
the tins you would you have to get a
whole<00:02:21.900> bunch<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.140> duplicates<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.680> think

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
whole bunch of duplicates I think

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.199 
whole bunch of duplicates I think
that'll<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.040> stupid<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:23.910> they<00:02:24.030> put<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
that'll be stupid so if they put a

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.880 
that'll be stupid so if they put a
different<00:02:24.540> character<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.840> each<00:02:24.959> tin<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:25.440> very

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
different character in each tin I'm very

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.350 
different character in each tin I'm very
happy<00:02:26.250> with<00:02:26.280> them<00:02:26.580> because<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.000> means<00:02:27.120> they

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
happy with them because that means they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.790 
happy with them because that means they
care<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:27.900> don't<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.230> us<00:02:28.260> blowing<00:02:28.680> all

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800

Jake the dogs I sure hope so oh there is
but<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.180> might<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.860> feels<00:03:17.100> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but I might have this one this feels a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.940 
but I might have this one this feels a
lot<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.880> zombie<00:03:18.780> Jake<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.260> dog<00:03:19.440> which<00:03:19.829> I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
lot like the zombie Jake the dog which I

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.410 
lot like the zombie Jake the dog which I
already<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:20.519> I'd<00:03:20.730> be<00:03:20.850> really<00:03:21.060> upset

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
already have which I'd be really upset

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.699 
already have which I'd be really upset
because<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.810> means<00:03:21.930> they're<00:03:22.470> trying<00:03:22.680> to

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
because that means they're trying to

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.340 
because that means they're trying to
take<00:03:22.860> us<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.130> all<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.280> our<00:03:23.370> money<00:03:23.489> guys<00:03:23.820> and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
take us for all of our money guys and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.319 
take us for all of our money guys and
they<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.560> they<00:03:26.310> put<00:03:26.549> duplicates<00:03:27.180> in

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
they are they put duplicates in

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.300 
they are they put duplicates in
different<00:03:27.900> tins<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.560> thought<00:03:28.799> fighting<00:03:29.160> all

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
different tins I thought fighting all

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.100 
different tins I thought fighting all
different<00:03:29.850> tins<00:03:30.060> i<00:03:30.239> would<00:03:30.390> get<00:03:30.540> lucky<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:30.989> not

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
different tins i would get lucky and not

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.690 
different tins i would get lucky and not
going<00:03:31.260> any<00:03:31.410> duplicates<00:03:31.890> but<00:03:32.400> here's<00:03:32.640> a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
going any duplicates but here's a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.539 
going any duplicates but here's a
duplicate<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.690> zombie<00:03:34.350> Jake<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.950> dog<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
duplicate it's zombie Jake the dog and

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.850 
duplicate it's zombie Jake the dog and
this<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.660> disappointing<00:03:36.900> because<00:03:37.620> now

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
this is really disappointing because now

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.970 
this is really disappointing because now
I<00:03:37.890> know<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:39.079> different<00:03:40.079> tins<00:03:40.380> doesn't<00:03:40.860> mean

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
I know that different tins doesn't mean

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.310 
I know that different tins doesn't mean
different<00:03:41.459> characters<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.660> basically<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.230> you

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
different characters so basically if you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.840 
different characters so basically if you
want<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.500> collect<00:03:43.620> all<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.860> tins<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.700> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
want to collect all the tins you have to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.580 
want to collect all the tins you have to
buy<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:45.269> 12<00:03:45.540> tins<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.959> then<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.350> go

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
buy all 12 tins and then you have to go

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.199 
buy all 12 tins and then you have to go
for<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.310> characters<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:47.940> you're<00:03:48.090> gonna

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
for all the characters so you're gonna

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.370 
for all the characters so you're gonna
have<00:03:48.390> eventually<00:03:48.810> are<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> duplicate

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
