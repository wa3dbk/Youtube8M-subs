00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.370 
I really haven't studied it yet but I
basically<00:04:12.350> try<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:12.950> get<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:14.269> diffuser<00:04:14.720> into

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
basically try to get the diffuser into

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.000 
basically try to get the diffuser into
my<00:04:15.560> roots<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.630> scrunched<00:04:17.630> up<00:04:17.840> my<00:04:18.169> ends<00:04:18.709> closer

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
my roots I scrunched up my ends closer

my roots I scrunched up my ends closer
to<00:04:19.370> my<00:04:19.520> head<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.739> that's<00:04:21.739> basically<00:04:22.039> what<00:04:22.310> I

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
to my head and that's basically what I

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.980 
to my head and that's basically what I
was<00:04:22.430> doing<00:04:22.789> for<00:04:22.820> about<00:04:23.500> 20

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
was doing for about 20

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.710 
was doing for about 20
-<00:04:25.080> 25<00:04:25.620> minutes<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:26.340> place<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.030> diffuser<00:04:27.449> on<00:04:27.690> a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
- 25 minutes I place the diffuser on a

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.189 
- 25 minutes I place the diffuser on a
random<00:04:28.319> sections<00:04:28.979> all<00:04:29.250> through<00:04:29.699> my<00:04:30.330> hair<00:04:30.810> I

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
random sections all through my hair I

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.409 
random sections all through my hair I
really<00:04:32.130> didn't<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.490> strategy<00:04:32.789> the

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
really didn't have a strategy the

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.360 
really didn't have a strategy the
strategy<00:04:33.449> was<00:04:34.050> just<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.380> get<00:04:34.500> my<00:04:34.680> hair<00:04:34.860> dry<00:04:35.310> as

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
strategy was just to get my hair dry as

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.730 
strategy was just to get my hair dry as
