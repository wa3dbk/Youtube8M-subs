this spool pin is all the way up or else
the<00:00:27.599> wheel<00:00:27.779> walks<00:00:28.050> that's<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.710> lock<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

and guess what these little sides are

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.900 
and guess what these little sides are
magnetic<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.660> they're<00:00:33.840> metal<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:35.700> pull

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
magnetic because they're metal you pull
