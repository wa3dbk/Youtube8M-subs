game called minecraft so earlier in this
morning

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
morning

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:37.520 
morning
minecraft<00:00:18.930> morning<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.500> made<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.900> trap<00:00:36.530> like

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
minecraft morning I made a trap like

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.700 
minecraft morning I made a trap like
this<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:39.680> Simon<00:00:41.930> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> end<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this actually Simon is the end of the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.150 
this actually Simon is the end of the
corridor<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:48.050> what<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
corridor and what you do when you see a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
corridor and what you do when you see a
switch<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.600> pull<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> switch<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.180> holy

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
switch or you pull the switch and holy

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
switch or you pull the switch and holy
 it's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> trap<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.920> course<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> trap

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
 it's a trap of course it's a trap

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:09.380 
 it's a trap of course it's a trap
what<00:00:57.390> else<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.129> switch<00:01:08.390> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
what else could it be it's a switch so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.940 
what else could it be it's a switch so
that's<00:01:09.689> obviously<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.500> trap<00:01:12.619> let's<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.770> how

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's obviously a trap let's see how

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
that's obviously a trap let's see how
this<00:01:14.130> trap<00:01:14.490> works

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this trap works

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.990 
this trap works
so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.920 

over<00:01:20.690> here<00:01:20.900> behind<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:21.470> block<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.370> switch

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
over here behind this block is a switch

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.320 
over here behind this block is a switch
and<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.140> wire<00:01:24.320> goes<00:01:24.710> from<00:01:25.010> that<00:01:25.250> switch<00:01:25.550> here

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
and the wire goes from that switch here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.850 
and the wire goes from that switch here
here<00:01:26.810> here<00:01:27.050> here<00:01:27.400> then<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.520> see<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.730> D<00:01:28.940> layers

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
here here here then you see the D layers

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.350 
here here here then you see the D layers
I've<00:01:30.860> put<00:01:31.250> these<00:01:31.370> dealers<00:01:31.820> because<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:35.150> wire

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
I've put these dealers because the wire

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.550 
I've put these dealers because the wire
was<00:01:35.780> too<00:01:36.350> short<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.200> put<00:01:39.410> them

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
was too short so I have to put them

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.340 
was too short so I have to put them
there<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.380> wire<00:01:42.830> goes<00:01:43.160> up<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:45.760> then<00:01:47.350> here

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
there so the wire goes up and then here

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.650 
there so the wire goes up and then here
are<00:01:48.650> another<00:01:48.950> dealers<00:01:49.430> these<00:01:50.270> dealers

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
are another dealers these dealers

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.310 
are another dealers these dealers
connect<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.520> wire<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.570> sticky<00:01:53.840> pistons

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
connect the wire to the sticky pistons

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.900 
connect the wire to the sticky pistons
that<00:01:54.979> are<00:01:55.190> hidden<00:01:56.170> behind<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.680> stone<00:02:00.910> I'm

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
that are hidden behind this stone I'm

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.990 
that are hidden behind this stone I'm
gonna<00:02:02.150> show<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.920> how<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:03.950> stick<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.580> distance

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
gonna show you how to stick it distance

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.930 
gonna show you how to stick it distance
work<00:02:05.300> atom<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.440> stick<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.250> bit<00:02:07.400> since<00:02:07.580> my<00:02:07.640> bet

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
work atom and stick a bit since my bet

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.470 
work atom and stick a bit since my bet
dealers<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.130> want<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.670> connect<00:02:11.150> this

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
dealers so if you want to connect this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.580 
dealers so if you want to connect this
redstone<00:02:12.400> directly<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.600> torch<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
redstone directly to this torch the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.820 
redstone directly to this torch the
other<00:02:15.709> side<00:02:16.040> there's<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.970> block<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.709> it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
other side there's a block now you do it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:28.650 
other side there's a block now you do it
like<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:27.140> put<00:02:27.380> switch

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
like this and like this you put switch

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.460 
like this and like this you put switch
nothing<00:02:29.660> happens<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.870> was<00:02:33.170> quite

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
nothing happens so it was quite

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.240 
nothing happens so it was quite
complicated<00:02:34.209> figure<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.330> out<00:02:35.510> what<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.380> but

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
complicated figure it out what to do but

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.729 
complicated figure it out what to do but
with<00:02:37.670> these<00:02:37.880> dealers<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.810> two<00:02:38.989> dealers<00:02:39.380> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
with these dealers it is two dealers and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:48.570 
with these dealers it is two dealers and
you<00:02:39.890> put<00:02:40.330> redstone<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:43.430> line

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.470 

the<00:02:49.580> dealer<00:02:50.030> connects<00:02:50.709> redstone<00:02:51.709> directly<00:02:55.480> so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
the dealer connects redstone directly so

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:09.509 
the dealer connects redstone directly so
whatever<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.470> want<00:02:57.500> to<00:03:02.230> switch<00:03:03.230> them

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:18.250 

actually<00:03:10.519> eight<00:03:11.860> under<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.250> block<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:18.110> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
actually eight under this block as you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:34.400 
actually eight under this block as you
saw<00:03:18.530> me<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:19.100> are<00:03:19.280> those<00:03:19.519> over<00:03:20.090> here

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.700 

mr.<00:03:35.010> blocks<00:03:36.860> they<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:38.040> up<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.560> when<00:03:40.560> you're

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
mr. blocks they go up so when you're

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.780 
mr. blocks they go up so when you're
inside<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.430> corridor<00:03:42.180> or<00:03:42.720> little<00:03:43.530> room<00:03:43.800> pull

inside this corridor or little room pull
the<00:03:44.910> switch<00:03:45.180> can't<00:03:45.960> get<00:03:46.290> away<00:03:46.380> because<00:03:46.740> it's

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
the switch can't get away because it's

00:03:47.660 --> 00:04:13.790 
the switch can't get away because it's
your<00:03:48.660> way<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:59.370> show<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.730> again<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:13.170> was<00:04:13.590> too

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
your way to show you again I was too

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.890 
your way to show you again I was too
late

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
late

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
late
as<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.080> can<00:04:16.200> see<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> trap<00:04:16.770> works<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
as you can see the trap works so the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.630 
as you can see the trap works so the
only<00:04:23.070> way<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:24.560> save<00:04:25.560> yourself<00:04:26.010> from<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.370> trap

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
only way to save yourself from this trap

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.640 
only way to save yourself from this trap
is<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.030> heaven<00:04:27.390> picx<00:04:28.820> make<00:04:29.820> your<00:04:30.030> way<00:04:30.210> out<00:04:32.180> you

just<00:04:43.509> prototype<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:45.099> trap<00:04:48.089> the<00:04:49.089> trap<00:04:49.289> belongs

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
just prototype the trap the trap belongs
