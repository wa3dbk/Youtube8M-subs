00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.950
 hello to everyone very short video for 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.160
 show you what you bought e 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.480
 what was given to me in these 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 days 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 then how do you see the first thing there 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.010
 monster is the pasta machine that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.290
 he had been looking for a long time and finally 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:42.260
 i found it i bought it from happy house 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:46.110
 is a network of virtually franchises 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:51.659
 that present here in Campania I don't know if 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.559
 in the other regions there is the one I paid for 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.350
 11 euros is the 99 that I have to say the price 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.549
 it's great because all the machines for the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.400
 pasta that I saw around was expensive 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:08.880
 20 euros up I saw machines for the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.960
 pasta even of 30 40 euros so I have it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.109
 caught on the fly and immediately went to show you 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 the car more closely 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:22.280
 then inside you will find the booklet 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.979
 of instructions 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:31.130
 then there is this fabric to keep the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.130
 fixed pasta machine at a table 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:52.299
 then there is practically the plate to make 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.409
 various types of pasta this is to make 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.670
 tagliatelle and fimo tagliatelle as 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.229
 someone said 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.990
 any reference is purely coincidental 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:08.489
 true luigi the tagliatelle is here to do 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.019
 it goes thinner than I think linguine 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.040
 spaghetti more than linguine this here 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.420
 I must say that this second one too 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:29.190
 plate in my opinion will be very useful and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 then practically this is the machine 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.019
 pasta here as you can see there is the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:43.150
 knob that you pull to adjust it 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.959
 rollers thickness inside and therefore 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.959
 is regulated by 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.990
 from 1 to 9 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.100
 I don't know if you see the numbers here 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.910
 I'm on the knob and then 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:17.600
 inside is practically the knob 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:23.269
 to turn that fits here e 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:28.940
 it serves precisely to turn then 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.630
 this machine is written nearby 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 to the box and to the plates 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.980
 inside in stainless steel so I have to 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.640
 to say that it is excellent and precisely on the hook 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:50.260
 for fixing the machine 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.260
 it can also then attach to a table 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.630
 now I can show you 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.180
 the plot to see the box here 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.530
 here, as you can see, there is written ideal 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.980
 for fettuccine spaghetti and tagliatelle 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.560
 below is written in stainless steel 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:28.300
 on the other side shows the hook 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:32.290
 to fix the machine to the table then 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.080
 another thing that you anticipate but that 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.330
 I will then calmly review the video camera 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:44.410
 from which he is recording which is precisely 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:50.410
 this only anticipates you one 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.440
 samsung hmx q20 this camcorder is me 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:59.890
 been given by my father for mine 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.410
 birthday and nothing is a video camera 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.320
 full hd 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.140
 however, I will talk about it in a 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.450
 next video more 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.400
 detailed 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:17.140
 I can't tell you though that I bought it 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:21.669
 by expert at the price of 169 euros the 90 in 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.830

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.220
