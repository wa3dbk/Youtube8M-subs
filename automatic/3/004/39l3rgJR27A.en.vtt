since no more and I heard the taking on

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.729 
since no more and I heard the taking on
noob<00:03:00.540> tubes<00:03:00.780> too<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.500> all<00:03:01.590> that

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
noob tubes too so it's just all that

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.070 
noob tubes too so it's just all that
good<00:03:01.890> stuff<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.340> heard<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> player

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
good stuff I heard that the player

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.540 
good stuff I heard that the player
interface<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.709> how<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.920> moves<00:03:05.190> kind<00:03:05.459> of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
interface like how you moves kind of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.920 
interface like how you moves kind of
changed<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.120> we'll<00:03:06.300> see<00:03:06.450> what<00:03:06.540> happens<00:03:06.690> with

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
changed so we'll see what happens with

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.440 
changed so we'll see what happens with
that<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.800> otherwise<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.850> seems<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.330> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
that but otherwise it seems like it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.050 
that but otherwise it seems like it
could<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.720> pretty<00:03:10.200> good<00:03:10.410> game<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> fingers

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
could be a pretty good game so fingers

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150 
could be a pretty good game so fingers
crossed<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.630> because<00:03:13.440> I'm<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.100> a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
crossed on that because I'm this is a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.310 
crossed on that because I'm this is a
lot<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.370> games<00:03:14.610> coming<00:03:14.850> out<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.780> that's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
lot of games coming out but that's

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.110 
lot of games coming out but that's
definitely<00:03:16.530> topping<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.220> list<00:03:17.250> because<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
definitely topping the list because you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.330 
definitely topping the list because you
know<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.630> involves<00:03:19.320> YouTube<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.950> more<00:03:20.250> than

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
know it involves YouTube like more than

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.790 
know it involves YouTube like more than
other<00:03:20.489> games<00:03:20.760> though<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.900> game<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.410> fun
