hi my name is Donna Lynn Lefevre and now
we're<00:00:06.569> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> move<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.560> next<00:00:07.770> kind

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
we're going to move on to the next kind

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.680 
we're going to move on to the next kind
of<00:00:08.160> ragging<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> applied<00:00:09.210> method

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
of ragging which is the applied method

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.780 
of ragging which is the applied method
again<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.679> just<00:00:10.860> putting<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.309> over<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> base

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
again it's just putting it over a base

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.990 
again it's just putting it over a base
paint<00:00:12.120> that's<00:00:12.690> already<00:00:12.960> there<00:00:13.820> we're<00:00:14.820> going

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
paint that's already there we're going

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480 
paint that's already there we're going
to<00:00:15.059> start<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.500> rags<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.340> actually

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to start with the rags and I actually

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
to start with the rags and I actually
don't<00:00:17.850> think<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.150> talked<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.539> them<00:00:18.720> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
don't think I've talked about them in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
don't think I've talked about them in
the<00:00:18.960> time<00:00:19.140> before<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.680> let<00:00:19.800> me<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.100> explain

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the time before but let me just explain

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.950 
the time before but let me just explain
where<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> rags<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> came<00:00:21.750> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
where the rags are that I came from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.029 
where the rags are that I came from
these<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.619> old<00:00:22.769> sheets<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> an<00:00:24.810> old

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
these are old sheets this is an old

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.330 
these are old sheets this is an old
linen<00:00:26.810> they<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.140> anything<00:00:28.500> what's<00:00:29.010> best

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
linen they can be anything what's best

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.160 
linen they can be anything what's best
for<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.789> sheets<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> rags<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> use

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
for the sheets of the rags that you use

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
for the sheets of the rags that you use
especially<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> particular<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
especially in this particular one is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
especially in this particular one is
that<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.870> all<00:00:34.260> cotton<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> polyester

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that they be all cotton the polyester

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
that they be all cotton the polyester
doesn't<00:00:35.880> absorb<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> paint<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
doesn't absorb the paint right and it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.369 
doesn't absorb the paint right and it
reacts<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.190> peculiarly<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
reacts a little peculiarly so what you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.110 
reacts a little peculiarly so what you
do<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> dabbing<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.489> method<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
do with the dabbing on method is just

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.090 
do with the dabbing on method is just
ball<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.500> funky<00:00:43.860> little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
ball it up into a kind of a funky little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380 
ball it up into a kind of a funky little
ball<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.059> you've<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.239> some

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
ball just so that you've got some

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.170 
ball just so that you've got some
imprint<00:00:46.020> space<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
imprint space and I'm going to use the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.889 
imprint space and I'm going to use the
interference<00:00:48.750> gold<00:00:49.079> paint<00:00:49.440> again<00:00:49.710> dab<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
interference gold paint again dab it in

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
interference gold paint again dab it in
swirl<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.110> around<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.010> may<00:00:53.129> take<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
swirl it around this one may take a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
swirl it around this one may take a
little<00:00:53.760> bit<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.210> than<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> plastic<00:00:55.739> because

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
little bit more than the plastic because

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.189 
little bit more than the plastic because
this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> absorb<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
this is actually going to absorb the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979 
this is actually going to absorb the
paint<00:00:58.440> versus<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> plastic<00:00:59.730> which<00:00:59.850> didn't<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
paint versus the plastic which didn't so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.450 
paint versus the plastic which didn't so
as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> put<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
as you go to put it on you can get the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
as you go to put it on you can get the
same<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> watch<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
same thing you just want to watch out to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
same thing you just want to watch out to
make<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.310> make<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> too

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
make it that you don't make it too

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
make it that you don't make it too
blobby<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> same<00:01:09.869> time<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> need<00:01:10.409> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
blobby but at the same time you need if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
blobby but at the same time you need if
you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:12.180> enough<00:01:12.210> paint<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you get not enough paint on there it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
you get not enough paint on there it
gets<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.040> thin<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> you'll<00:01:15.810> just

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
gets really really thin so you'll just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
gets really really thin so you'll just
have<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> keep<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.530> back<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.360> putting<00:01:18.360> some

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
have to keep going back and putting some

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
have to keep going back and putting some
more<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.350> flinging<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.979> over

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
more on and not flinging it all over

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.749 
more on and not flinging it all over
your<00:01:20.340> stuff<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.939> am<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.960> anyway<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
your stuff like I am so anyway this is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.410 
your stuff like I am so anyway this is
um<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:30.240> as

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
um and also this one can be not as

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
um and also this one can be not as
tricky<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.470> plastic<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.159> getting<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
tricky as the plastic and getting in the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.980 
tricky as the plastic and getting in the
corners<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> plastics<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> little

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
corners because the plastics is a little

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
corners because the plastics is a little
more<00:01:34.079> uncontrollable<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.909> go

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
more uncontrollable but when you do go

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.920 
more uncontrollable but when you do go
into<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> corner<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> just

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
into a corner you want to kind of just

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.880 
into a corner you want to kind of just
dab<00:01:40.070> like<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.759> once<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.649> don't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
dab like that once if you in and don't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
dab like that once if you in and don't
push<00:01:44.100> too<00:01:44.130> terribly<00:01:44.759> hard<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.420> end

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
push too terribly hard or you will end

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
push too terribly hard or you will end
up<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.079> blob<00:01:46.320> there's<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.250> thing

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
up with the big blob there's one thing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.359 
up with the big blob there's one thing
that<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.649> well<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that this one and well this one is the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.770 
that this one and well this one is the
most<00:01:50.549> forgiving<00:01:51.060> even<00:01:51.360> though<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
most forgiving even though I think you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
most forgiving even though I think you
can<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> plastic<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.920> well

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
can do it with the plastic as well

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.649 
can do it with the plastic as well
you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.229> plastic<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.439> rag<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:57.000> base<00:01:57.270> coat

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you can plastic or rag your base coat

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.590 
you can plastic or rag your base coat
color<00:01:57.869> back<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.680> top<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.210> big<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
color back on top of if it's too big and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.620 
color back on top of if it's too big and
thick<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.899> blobby<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.189> help

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
thick and blobby and that will help

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.209 
thick and blobby and that will help
prevent<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
prevent that so that you don't have that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.850 
prevent that so that you don't have that
as<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.369> overall<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
as your overall look so that is with the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.779 
as your overall look so that is with the
interference<00:02:08.129> goal<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
interference goal which is a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.490 
interference goal which is a
full-strength<00:02:09.300> paint<00:02:09.720> but

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
full-strength paint but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.450 
full-strength paint but
see<00:02:10.710> where<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> goes<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.850> we<00:02:12.090> use<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.540> glaze<00:02:13.460> it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
see where it goes if we use the glaze it

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.340 
see where it goes if we use the glaze it
shouldn't<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:15.030> an<00:02:15.150> issue

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
shouldn't be an issue

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.780 
shouldn't be an issue
this<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.800> should<00:02:16.950> actually<00:02:17.190> read<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> little

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
this one should actually read a little

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.730 
this one should actually read a little
better<00:02:18.060> than<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:19.470> plastic<00:02:21.050> again<00:02:22.050> we'll<00:02:22.500> just

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
better than the plastic again we'll just

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.800 
better than the plastic again we'll just
put<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.480> ball<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.780> again<00:02:25.310> get<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> nice

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
put the ball it up again get a nice

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.550 
put the ball it up again get a nice
imprint<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> look<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:30.560> yeah

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
imprint that you want to look at yeah

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.600 
imprint that you want to look at yeah
there<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.370> as

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
there we go and you can see that if as

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.660 
there we go and you can see that if as
you<00:02:36.240> do<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.680> liked<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.370> thin

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you do it if you liked it really thin

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
you do it if you liked it really thin
you'd<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.360> go<00:02:39.480> back<00:02:39.510> over<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:40.050> your

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you'd have to go back over with your

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.350 
you'd have to go back over with your
base<00:02:40.380> coat<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> always

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
base coat with this but you can always

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.229 
base coat with this but you can always
go<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.080> vary<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.400> other<00:02:44.580> good<00:02:44.910> thing<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
go in vary it the other good thing and

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.520 
go in vary it the other good thing and
especially<00:02:45.600> with<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.200> because<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.500> can

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
especially with this one because you can

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.460 
especially with this one because you can
see<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.950> easier<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:48.180> way<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> even<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.260> your

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
see it easier is a way to even out your

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
see it easier is a way to even out your
darks<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.160> lights<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.510> go

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
darks to your lights it's just to go

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.660 
darks to your lights it's just to go
back<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.930> put<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> dark<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> middle<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.550> if

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
back and put a dark in the middle so if

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.490 
back and put a dark in the middle so if
it's<00:02:53.820> too<00:02:54.060> light<00:02:54.270> someplace<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.870> put<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> dark

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
it's too light someplace just put a dark

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.340 
it's too light someplace just put a dark
there<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.550> helps<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> make<00:02:57.870> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
there and then that helps to make it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.270 
there and then that helps to make it
look<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> little<00:02:58.830> better<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.890> will<00:03:05.100> go

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
look a little better and as you will go

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
look a little better and as you will go
your<00:03:05.520> rag<00:03:05.760> will<00:03:06.209> eventually<00:03:06.959> especially<00:03:07.350> if

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
your rag will eventually especially if

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.630 
your rag will eventually especially if
you're<00:03:07.500> doing<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.770> over<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> whole<00:03:08.190> wall<00:03:08.400> will

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
you're doing it over a whole wall will

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.340 
you're doing it over a whole wall will
get<00:03:08.790> saturated<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.810> won't<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.200> but

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
get saturated and you won't like it but

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.530 
get saturated and you won't like it but
you<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.709> keep<00:03:10.920> twisting<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.730> twisting

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
you just keep twisting and twisting

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.930 
you just keep twisting and twisting
until<00:03:13.260> you've<00:03:13.440> used<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.310> your<00:03:14.489> rag<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
until you've used you know your rag to a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.280 
until you've used you know your rag to a
point<00:03:15.180> where<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.390> can't<00:03:15.600> stand<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.019> any

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
point where you can't stand it any

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.310 
point where you can't stand it any
longer<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.769> that's<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.320> to
