00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.009
 500gr chicken full of protein and 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.420
 fiber this recipe should delight too 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.420
 well the big ones as the little ones 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.260
 for 2 to 3 people you will need 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.870
 of 300 g of whites all cut in 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.180
 cubes of fiber- based cereals 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.080
 general it's the long little bar 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.730
 in cereals 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 I did not find that with girls 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 for but this one containing more of the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.540
 protein so it was very interesting 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.390
 you will also need garlic powder 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.080
 paprika onions and salt and also 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.850
 two white 2 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.190
 after cutting your white from 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.380
 chicken in cubes we're going to actually go to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.650
 blender cereal fiber-based 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:48.490
 to get a powder so here there is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:51.050
 About 30 grams of cereal and myths 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.060
 so you can mix well until 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.840
 that it becomes the powder with which 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.130
 in fact we will not lead the chickens and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.130
 we put everything in a bowl 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.380
 to this preparation you will add 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.500
 a teaspoon of garlic powder 2 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.720
 to give two paprika of salt and you 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.190
 mix everything in the second bowl on 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.940
 will break the eggs and invade 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.350
 keep both whites 2 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.440
 here is the size of the chicken cubes that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.190
 I prepared you do according to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.110
 your preference 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.670
 on the other hand it is enough to pass the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.490
 chicken pieces in the egg white 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.080
 and then in the cereal mix and in 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.350
 place all on a sheet of 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.350
 baking 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.540
 we repeat the same procedure for the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.370
 rest comes from it is to go over 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.720
 fast but you're a good part of 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.810
 chicken in the eyes and then directly 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.930
 in cereals but that's the result 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.810
 it only remains to cook we will do them 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.459
 bake at 180 ° for about 20 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.310
 minutes or until it finishes 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.620
