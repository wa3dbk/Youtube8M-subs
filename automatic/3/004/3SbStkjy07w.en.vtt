disc the same front of the cylinder and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.590 
disc the same front of the cylinder and
that's<00:00:46.520> gonna<00:00:46.700> be<00:00:46.850> attached<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.530> perhaps<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
that's gonna be attached to perhaps a

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.389 
that's gonna be attached to perhaps a
ring<00:00:50.600> cylinder<00:00:51.170> just<00:00:51.559> Pat<00:00:51.800> me<00:00:52.010> on<00:00:52.040> so<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:52.309> can

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
ring cylinder just Pat me on so you can

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.940 
ring cylinder just Pat me on so you can
see<00:00:52.550> one<00:00:52.700> on<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.850> back<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.210> another<00:00:53.450> door<00:00:53.950> like

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
see one on the back of another door like

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.479 
see one on the back of another door like
so<00:00:55.899> okay<00:00:56.899> I'll<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:57.379> also<00:00:57.559> deadlock<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.309> these

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
so okay I'll see also deadlock in these

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.650 
so okay I'll see also deadlock in these
ones<00:00:58.760> and<00:01:00.820> additional<00:01:01.820> little<00:01:02.059> snip<00:01:02.270> that

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
ones and additional little snip that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.370 
ones and additional little snip that
just<00:01:02.870> shoots<00:01:03.050> out<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.369> fast<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.380> DEP

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
just shoots out and fast the DEP

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.210 
just shoots out and fast the DEP
knocking<00:01:06.740> okay<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:09.500> pen<00:01:09.860> back<00:01:10.039> ran

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
knocking okay so that just pen back ran

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.889 
knocking okay so that just pen back ran
out<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.580> one<00:01:11.080> okay<00:01:12.080> say<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.250> lock

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
out to this one okay say with this lock

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.809 
out to this one okay say with this lock
for<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.929> bigger<00:01:15.140> point<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.530> view<00:01:15.619> if<00:01:15.890> everything

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
for a bigger point of view if everything

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.059 
for a bigger point of view if everything
is<00:01:17.030> exactly<00:01:17.209> the<00:01:17.479> same<00:01:17.649> okay<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.979> only

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
is exactly the same okay the only

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:20.380 
is exactly the same okay the only
difference<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.670> obviously<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.119> got<00:01:20.300> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
difference is obviously you got the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.889 
difference is obviously you got the
rotating<00:01:20.899> disc<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:22.069> in<00:01:22.250> front<00:01:22.459> of<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.600> actual

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
rotating disc now in front of the actual

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.190 
rotating disc now in front of the actual
plug<00:01:24.140> sort<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.220> obscures<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.179> key<00:01:26.479> right<00:01:26.810> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
plug sort of obscures the key right and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.889 
plug sort of obscures the key right and
but<00:01:27.770> my<00:01:27.950> enrollees<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.270> main<00:01:29.420> run<00:01:29.569> of<00:01:29.690> any

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
but my enrollees and the main run of any

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.570 
but my enrollees and the main run of any
lot<00:01:30.470> begin<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:32.420> obviously<00:01:32.959> if<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.110> can<00:01:33.289> apply

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
lot begin is obviously if you can apply

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.820 
lot begin is obviously if you can apply
tension<00:01:34.580> onto<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.090> plug<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.410> rotate<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
tension onto the plug and to rotate the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.559 
tension onto the plug and to rotate the
plug<00:01:37.039> as<00:01:37.550> long<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:37.819> that<00:01:37.940> doesn't<00:01:38.090> interrupt

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
plug as long as that doesn't interrupt

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.089 
plug as long as that doesn't interrupt
you<00:01:38.780> getting<00:01:39.050> your<00:01:39.200> paper<00:01:39.619> your<00:01:39.770> pick<00:01:39.920> gun

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
you getting your paper your pick gun

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.160 
you getting your paper your pick gun
etcetera<00:01:40.580> into<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.910> lock<00:01:41.119> then<00:01:42.020> it's

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
etcetera into the lock then it's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.199 
etcetera into the lock then it's
absolutely<00:01:42.259> fine<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.759> always<00:01:43.970> say<00:01:44.149> to

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
absolutely fine in what I always say to

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.609 
absolutely fine in what I always say to
people<00:01:44.270> if<00:01:44.630> something<00:01:44.929> isn't<00:01:45.080> working<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
people if something isn't working you

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.719 
people if something isn't working you

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
change and adapt okay okay so with this

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.600 
change and adapt okay okay so with this
type<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.000> lock<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.479> tend<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.950> tend<00:01:52.250> to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
type of lock what I tend to do I tend to

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.469 
type of lock what I tend to do I tend to
use<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.819> tension<00:01:53.179> tool<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:55.310> has<00:01:55.489> quite

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
use the tension tool and it has quite

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.839 
use the tension tool and it has quite
long<00:01:56.690> legs<00:01:56.989> okay<00:01:57.890> something<00:01:58.369> perhaps<00:01:58.550> like

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
long legs okay something perhaps like

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.630 
long legs okay something perhaps like
this<00:01:59.349> okay<00:02:00.349> this<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.679> just<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.009> rigid<00:02:01.399> tent

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
this okay this is just a rigid tent

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.660 
this okay this is just a rigid tent
there<00:02:01.910> attention<00:02:02.479> till<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:03.500> got<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.369> like<00:02:04.399> age

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
there attention till it got to like age

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.580 
there attention till it got to like age

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.870 
end quite long one thin one wide where
you<00:02:09.679> could<00:02:09.890> perhaps<00:02:10.039> use<00:02:10.250> something<00:02:10.700> like<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
you could perhaps use something like a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.110 
you could perhaps use something like a
soft<00:02:11.209> Bend<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.290> something<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.610> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the soft paint off obviously shaped like

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.240 
the soft paint off obviously shaped like
so<00:02:16.360> because<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.510> bring<00:02:17.719> you<00:02:17.930> away<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.829> out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
from a picking point of view I'm just

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.190 
from a picking point of view I'm just
gonna<00:02:34.050> pair<00:02:34.350> round<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.800> bit<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.400> can

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
zoom in okay see see the pin tumbler

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.700 
zoom in okay see see the pin tumbler
there<00:02:53.630> okay<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.020> need<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> make

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
there okay so all I need to do is make

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.410 
there okay so all I need to do is make
sure<00:02:55.740> first<00:02:56.250> off<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> look<00:02:56.910> into<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.270> key

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
sure first off that I look into the key

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.350 
sure first off that I look into the key
weight<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.130> see<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.760> price<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
weight and so I can see the price the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.480 
weight and so I can see the price the
profile<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.050> plug<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.290> will<00:03:01.590> give<00:03:01.740> me<00:03:01.890> an

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
profile of the plug that will give me an

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.190 
profile of the plug that will give me an
idea<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.940> where<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.210> position<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.810> pick<00:03:04.020> know

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
idea of where to position my pick know

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.570 
idea of where to position my pick know
what<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.470> generally<00:03:04.620> find<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.190> when<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> go

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
what you generally find is when you go

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.910 
what you generally find is when you go
in<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.930> one's<00:03:07.110> got<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.710> know<00:03:07.800> it's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
in and this one's got you know it's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130 
in and this one's got you know it's
quite<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> long<00:03:08.340> leg<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.510> does<00:03:09.660> catch<00:03:09.960> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
quite a long leg and it does catch the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.840 
quite a long leg and it does catch the
plug<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> danger<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.400> could<00:03:11.550> sort<00:03:11.820> of

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
plug but as a danger it could sort of

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.330 
plug but as a danger it could sort of
slip<00:03:12.120> out<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.720> sometimes<00:03:13.590> what<00:03:13.950> happens<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
slip out and sometimes what happens is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.770 
slip out and sometimes what happens is
when<00:03:14.580> you're<00:03:14.670> picking<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.060> slips<00:03:15.300> out<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.630> get

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
when you're picking it slips out you get

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.290 
when you're picking it slips out you get
a<00:03:15.810> rotation<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.220> front<00:03:17.730> disc<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.270> you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
a rotation of the front disc and you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.790 
a rotation of the front disc and you
think<00:03:18.510> all<00:03:18.570> right<00:03:18.780> spit<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.620> know<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
think all right spit you know the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.140 
think all right spit you know the
testing<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.760> actually<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
testing it's not it's actually just

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.140 
testing it's not it's actually just
slipped<00:03:21.420> out<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.500> keyway<00:03:23.000> okay<00:03:24.000> because

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
slipped out of the keyway okay because

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.030 
slipped out of the keyway okay because
it's<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> profiles<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.080> these<00:03:25.230> AR<00:03:25.500> raises<00:03:26.010> a

right<00:04:06.120> along<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> underside<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.959> pins<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.590> just

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
right along the underside of pins I just

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.280 
right along the underside of pins I just
start<00:04:07.950> off<00:04:08.010> nice<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.989> what<00:04:09.989> I'm<00:04:10.080> doing

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
start off nice and like what I'm doing

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.509 
start off nice and like what I'm doing
all<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> time<00:04:10.680> I'm<00:04:10.920> testing<00:04:11.370> different

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
all the time I'm testing different

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.290 
all the time I'm testing different
slightly<00:04:12.060> different<00:04:12.209> angles<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.200> cake

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
slightly different angles of the cake

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.150 
slightly different angles of the cake
and<00:04:15.300> just<00:04:15.360> feathering<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.290> tension<00:04:16.769> on<00:04:16.950> and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and just feathering that tension on and

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.080 
and just feathering that tension on and
off<00:04:17.280> as<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.549> fit

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
off as I fit

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.420 
off as I fit
spend<00:04:18.989> some<00:04:19.140> quiet

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.700 

that's<00:04:23.430> always<00:04:23.610> not<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:24.000> high<00:04:24.590> because<00:04:25.590> what

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
that's always not as high because what

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
that's always not as high because what
you've<00:04:25.830> got<00:04:25.920> to<00:04:26.010> do<00:04:26.130> is<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.310> try<00:04:26.610> different

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
you've got to do is just try different

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.530 
you've got to do is just try different
positions<00:04:27.740> with<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.920> pick<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:30.060> making<00:04:30.390> sure

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
positions with that pick but making sure

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.020 
positions with that pick but making sure
that<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.750> start<00:04:30.990> off<00:04:31.140> nice<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.440> low<00:04:31.890> on<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that you start off nice and low on the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.180 
that you start off nice and low on the
pins<00:04:33.390> not<00:04:33.660> too<00:04:33.870> high<00:04:34.050> don't<00:04:34.350> expect<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.980> kill

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
pins not too high don't expect to kill

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.310 
pins not too high don't expect to kill
and<00:04:35.820> then<00:04:35.970> start<00:04:36.270> get<00:04:36.510> some<00:04:36.690> height<00:04:36.930> as<00:04:37.140> you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
and then start get some height as you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.800 
and then start get some height as you
start<00:04:37.650> yet<00:04:37.920> we<00:04:38.880> mentioned<00:04:39.300> going<00:04:39.450> with<00:04:39.720> you

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
start yet we mentioned going with you

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.770 
start yet we mentioned going with you
picked<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.200> slight<00:04:41.070> snag<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.760> there<00:04:41.970> good

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
picked a slight snag in there good

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.330 
picked a slight snag in there good
scientists<00:04:43.380> saying<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> me<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> pins<00:04:44.160> are

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
scientists saying to me the pins are

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.890 
scientists saying to me the pins are
being<00:04:44.520> worked<00:04:45.470> ok<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:46.530> that's<00:04:47.010> gone<00:04:47.190> quite<00:04:47.790> far

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
being worked ok so that's gone quite far

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
being worked ok so that's gone quite far
and<00:04:48.900> one<00:04:49.050> didn't<00:04:49.260> actually<00:04:49.440> frame<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
and one didn't actually frame the

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.120 
and one didn't actually frame the
inter-mountain<00:04:50.160> pick<00:04:51.560> which<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.710> will<00:04:52.890> do

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
inter-mountain pick which they will do

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.940 
inter-mountain pick which they will do
so<00:04:53.910> oh<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.510> screwdriver<00:04:55.050> into<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.410> lock

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
so oh just screwdriver into a lock

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.690 
so oh just screwdriver into a lock

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
for was for that the site variant EP

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.340 
for was for that the site variant EP
okay<00:05:05.970> we'll<00:05:06.240> just<00:05:06.330> give<00:05:06.390> it<00:05:06.600> another<00:05:06.750> shot

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
okay we'll just give it another shot

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.950 
okay we'll just give it another shot
if<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.460> does<00:05:08.640> go<00:05:08.820> mean<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.150> only<00:05:09.300> pick<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.780> so

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
if it does go mean to only pick you so

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.940 
if it does go mean to only pick you so
we<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.290> reset<00:05:10.830> okay<00:05:11.310> reset<00:05:11.970> pin<00:05:12.890> okay<00:05:13.890> so

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
we just reset okay reset pin okay so

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.900 
we just reset okay reset pin okay so
that's<00:05:14.190> gone<00:05:14.370> into<00:05:14.520> ant

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
that's gone into ant

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.420 
that's gone into ant
into<00:05:15.300> NTP<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:16.470> goes<00:05:16.650> all<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.830> pins<00:05:17.100> are<00:05:17.250> died

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
into NTP it goes all the pins are died

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.090 
into NTP it goes all the pins are died
on<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:17.760> all<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.910> do<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.210> keep<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.510> tools<00:05:18.750> in

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
on it's all I do is keep the tools in

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.620 
on it's all I do is keep the tools in
just<00:05:20.100> rotate<00:05:20.460> everything<00:05:20.880> back<00:05:21.120> let<00:05:21.420> it<00:05:21.450> be

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
just rotate everything back let it be

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.600 
just rotate everything back let it be
set<00:05:21.930> pick<00:05:22.830> again<00:05:23.960> okay<00:05:24.960> keys<00:05:25.370> when<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.460> goes

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
set pick again okay keys when it goes

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.120 
set pick again okay keys when it goes
into<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:26.970> full<00:05:27.180> set<00:05:27.510> that's<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.530> good<00:05:28.710> sign<00:05:28.920> the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
into a full set that's a good sign the

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.390 
into a full set that's a good sign the
lock<00:05:29.310> screen<00:05:29.520> works<00:05:30.950> process<00:05:31.950> now<00:05:32.160> it's<00:05:32.310> just

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
lock screen works process now it's just

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.340 
lock screen works process now it's just
a<00:05:32.550> case<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.760> picking<00:05:33.060> resetting<00:05:33.750> got<00:05:34.110> into

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
a case of picking resetting got into

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.520 
a case of picking resetting got into
anti<00:05:34.620> pick<00:05:34.830> again<00:05:35.100> so<00:05:36.060> again<00:05:36.290> to<00:05:37.290> use<00:05:37.380> that

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
anti pick again so again to use that

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.980 
anti pick again so again to use that
flat<00:05:37.770> back<00:05:37.980> let<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.430> reset<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.660> get<00:05:42.840> to

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
flat back let it reset and you get to

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.830 
flat back let it reset and you get to
know<00:05:43.110> when<00:05:43.290> these<00:05:43.410> locks<00:05:43.710> how<00:05:43.920> far<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:45.600> plug

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
know when these locks how far the plug

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.080 
know when these locks how far the plug
turns<00:05:46.140> when<00:05:46.410> it's<00:05:46.560> actually<00:05:46.710> gone<00:05:47.490> like<00:05:47.880> that

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
turns when it's actually gone like that

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.760 
turns when it's actually gone like that
as<00:05:48.420> opposed<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.170> a<00:05:49.260> toothpick

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
as opposed to a toothpick

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.970 
as opposed to a toothpick
okay<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:50.760> again<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.180> could<00:05:51.360> use<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:52.590> tension

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
okay so again I could use the tension

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.490 
okay so again I could use the tension
tool<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.550> turn<00:05:53.730> the<00:05:53.940> plug<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.420> case<00:05:55.140> of<00:05:55.350> rigid

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
tool to turn the plug a case of rigid

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.530 
tool to turn the plug a case of rigid
tension<00:05:56.070> tool<00:05:56.280> but<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:56.940> may<00:05:57.030> not<00:05:57.060> be<00:05:57.240> enough

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
tension tool but it may not be enough

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.450 
tension tool but it may not be enough
room<00:05:57.720> because<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.170> doorstop<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.190> just

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
room because in a doorstop so I just

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.670 
room because in a doorstop so I just
tend<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.700> hold<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.030> in<00:06:00.120> position<00:06:00.680> screwdriver

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
tend to hold it in position screwdriver

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.440 
tend to hold it in position screwdriver
in<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:03.150> open<00:06:03.630> a<00:06:03.690> door<00:06:04.130> okay<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:06.180> let's<00:06:06.360> just

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
in to open a door okay so let's just

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:32.069 
find that nice sweet spot on the plug to

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.010 
find that nice sweet spot on the plug to
get<00:07:32.219> your<00:07:32.370> tension<00:07:32.729> tool<00:07:32.909> on<00:07:33.089> obviously<00:07:33.900> if

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
get your tension tool on obviously if

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.379

this<00:07:34.110> is<00:07:34.229> a<00:07:34.259> right<00:07:34.500> mounted<00:07:34.979> lock<00:07:35.159> I<00:07:35.460> could<00:07:36.029> if

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
this is a right mounted lock I could if

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.430 
this is a right mounted lock I could if
there<00:07:36.599> wasn't<00:07:36.810> a<00:07:36.839> door<00:07:36.990> frame<00:07:37.169> here

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440

there wasn't a door frame here
I<00:07:37.560> could<00:07:37.740> have<00:07:37.860> attention<00:07:38.279> to<00:07:38.400> at<00:07:38.550> the<00:07:38.610> top<00:07:38.789> of

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 
I could have attention to at the top of

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.050 
I could have attention to at the top of
the<00:07:39.000> KD<00:07:39.240> way<00:07:39.389> to<00:07:40.020> write<00:07:40.169> tight<00:07:40.409> around<00:07:41.060> etc

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 
the KD way to write tight around etc

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.740 
the KD way to write tight around etc
okay<00:07:42.750> it's<00:07:43.199> all<00:07:43.289> about<00:07:43.529> change<00:07:43.949> and<00:07:44.400> adapt<00:07:44.759> but

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750 
okay it's all about change and adapt but
