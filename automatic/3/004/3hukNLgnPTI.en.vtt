where when you get the foam rubber a lot

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.810 
where when you get the foam rubber a lot
of<00:04:23.020> times<00:04:23.229> these<00:04:23.440> boxes<00:04:23.949> were<00:04:24.130> pre-creased

of times these boxes were pre-creased

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.490 
of times these boxes were pre-creased
for<00:04:25.120> some<00:04:25.300> reason<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:27.780> it's<00:04:28.780> definitely<00:04:29.320> a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
for some reason and it's definitely a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.560 
for some reason and it's definitely a
distinct<00:04:30.039> difference<00:04:30.250> because<00:04:30.910> I've<00:04:31.060> got<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
distinct difference because I've got a

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.010 
distinct difference because I've got a
lesser<00:04:32.560> quality<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.220> guy<00:04:33.900> nestled<00:04:34.900> in
