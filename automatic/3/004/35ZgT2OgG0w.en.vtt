00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.380
I have two Forest axes from Autine

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.160
by John Neeman 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.260
They may look similar

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.580
But every shape is unique

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.320
The bottom one I will use first

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:09.903
Now it's time to use another axe 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.700
It is heavier than the first but has a narrower bit shape 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.140
I was lazy enough to cut too shallow on the right side

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.680
So the tree decided to fall to the left :D

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.520
This pine was 65 years old according to the rings

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.620
Stormy wind broke off the top

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.260
Thank you, forest, for this tree

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.480
I will try to use it worthy
