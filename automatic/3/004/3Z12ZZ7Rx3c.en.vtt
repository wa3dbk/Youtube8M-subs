00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
heavy you need to parry and again if you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
then you'll crack that step back with

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.109 
then you'll crack that step back with
light<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.810> again<00:01:19.439> similar<00:01:19.889> to<00:01:19.920> jaw<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.939> can

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

light you again similar to jaw you can
either<00:01:21.270> dodge<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.020> step<00:01:22.289> back<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.759> can

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
swords past you if you're going to dodge

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.899 
swords past you if you're going to dodge

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it onto his second step back and this is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
it onto his second step back and this is
similar<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.679> all<00:01:40.920> three<00:01:41.279> weapon<00:01:41.670> classes<00:01:41.999> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
similar for all three weapon classes I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.769 
similar for all three weapon classes I
would<00:01:43.409> suggest<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.459> parry<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.270> step<00:01:45.539> back

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
would suggest you parry the step back

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:48.019 
would suggest you parry the step back
now<00:01:46.139> you'll<00:01:46.349> see<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.859> one<00:01:47.130> he<00:01:47.429> takes<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.849> few

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:48.029 
now you'll see this one he takes a few

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.139 
now you'll see this one he takes a few
steps<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.749> and<00:01:49.109> then<00:01:49.950> comes<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.969> you<00:01:51.119> with

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
steps back and then comes at you with

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.980 
steps back and then comes at you with
both<00:01:51.479> swords<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> both<00:01:53.969> withdraw<00:01:54.599> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
both swords and so both withdraw and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.609 
both swords and so both withdraw and
with<00:01:55.439> heavy<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.459> light<00:01:57.289> what<00:01:58.289> you<00:01:58.439> need

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
with heavy and with light what you need

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
with heavy and with light what you need
to<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.919> there<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.520> parry<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.599> step<00:02:00.899> back

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
to do there is just parry the step back

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.760 
to do there is just parry the step back
and<00:02:01.319> it's<00:02:01.859> the<00:02:02.039> timing<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.669> the<00:02:02.880> parry<00:02:03.149> so

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and it's the timing of the parry so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.260 
and it's the timing of the parry so
basically<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:05.069> soon<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.490> he<00:02:05.609> starts<00:02:05.999> coming

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
basically as soon as he starts coming

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.889 
basically as soon as he starts coming
towards<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.409> turning<00:02:07.979> towards<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.640> parry<00:02:09.599> at

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
towards you turning towards you parry at

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.850 
towards you turning towards you parry at
that<00:02:10.080> point<00:02:11.300> before<00:02:12.300> he's<00:02:12.510> fully<00:02:13.050> facing<00:02:13.680> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that point before he's fully facing you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.449 
that point before he's fully facing you
and<00:02:15.080> you'll<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.349> there<00:02:16.560> being<00:02:17.040> parried

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and you'll see it there being parried

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.020 
and you'll see it there being parried
with<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.540> light<00:02:19.050> weapon

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
with the light weapon

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.200 
with the light weapon
so<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.720> fairly<00:02:21.960> straightforward<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.950> well

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
so that's fairly straightforward as well

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.360 
so that's fairly straightforward as well
now<00:02:24.210> on<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.630> his<00:02:24.990> last<00:02:25.290> step<00:02:25.620> back<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
now on to his last step back and this is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.730 
now on to his last step back and this is
the<00:02:26.670> hard<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.180> step<00:02:27.570> back<00:02:27.780> three<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
the hard one step back three this is

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.900 
the hard one step back three this is
very<00:02:29.040> Hardy<00:02:29.550> timing<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.230> firstly<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.400> your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
very Hardy timing so firstly with your

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330 
very Hardy timing so firstly with your
weapons<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.780> I'll<00:02:34.050> slow<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.830> down<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
weapons and I'll slow this right down to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850 
weapons and I'll slow this right down to
show<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.510> recognize<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.470> he<00:02:37.590> puts

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
show you you can recognize it as he puts

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.030 
show you you can recognize it as he puts
both<00:02:38.130> weapons<00:02:38.850> together<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.110> then<00:02:40.650> he<00:02:40.800> does<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
both weapons together and then he does a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.970 
both weapons together and then he does a
windmill<00:02:41.640> leap<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:43.830> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
windmill leap at you and you need to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.640 
windmill leap at you and you need to
dodge<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> left<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.300> wait<00:02:46.020> for<00:02:46.320> him<00:02:46.440> to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
dodge to the left and wait for him to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.699 
dodge to the left and wait for him to
land<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.820> swipe<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.350> soon<00:02:49.530> as

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
land and do that swipe and as soon as

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.890 
land and do that swipe and as soon as
he's<00:02:49.860> done<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.310> white<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.600> release

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
he's done that's white you can release

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.190 
he's done that's white you can release
your<00:02:52.200> dodge<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.740> duck<00:02:53.130> immediately<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.330> then

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
your dodge and duck immediately and then

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100 
your dodge and duck immediately and then
you'll<00:02:55.440> avoid<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:56.220> step<00:02:56.580> back<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:57.840> heavy

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
you'll avoid that step back with heavy

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.100 
you'll avoid that step back with heavy
it's<00:02:58.410> also<00:02:58.620> complicated<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.450> need<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.080> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's also complicated you need to do a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.580 
it's also complicated you need to do a
center<00:03:01.830> block<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> first<00:03:03.330> two<00:03:04.140> blocks

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
center block for the first two blocks

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.420 
center block for the first two blocks
and<00:03:05.120> then<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.480> left<00:03:06.930> block<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.860> right<00:03:08.100> blocks

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and then a left block and a right blocks

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.120 
and then a left block and a right blocks
are<00:03:08.670> two<00:03:08.910> Center<00:03:09.450> blocks<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:10.140> he's<00:03:10.470> landing

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
are two Center blocks as he's landing

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.699 
are two Center blocks as he's landing
then<00:03:11.880> Alec<00:03:12.180> quick<00:03:12.480> left<00:03:12.900> block<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.590> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
then Alec quick left block for that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.729 
then Alec quick left block for that
swipe<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.489> then<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.510> right<00:03:15.870> block<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
swipe and then a right block for the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.360 
swipe and then a right block for the
last<00:03:16.950> hit<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:18.780> did<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.290> by<00:03:19.500> sound<00:03:19.950> I
