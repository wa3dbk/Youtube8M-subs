00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.069
 Good day, we present. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.719
 your attention to a small video review 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.030
 distressed graphics card 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 problems with it began after the desire 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 our client to put another system 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.039
 cooling in this case the system 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.310
 cooling zalman 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.929
 what are its minuses 1 minus is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 that for powering her colors 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.399
 need to connect to maternal 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.489
 circuit board as electronics itself 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.469
 video cards on which, respectively 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.100
 there was another cooling system which 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 something did not suit the client means this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.899
 system is new it is rotation speed 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 coolers not controlled 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.770
 well, that is, if we connect to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.039
 motherboard does not constantly spin 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.640
 at the maximum because maternal 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.140
 the dress 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 absolutely no matter what 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 The chip temperature is therefore 1 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.070
 minus this modification is an increase 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.740
 noise now about the shortcomings of such a system 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.010
 cooling why it all the same is not worth it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.790
 set means this so -called 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.780
 lattice cooling system where 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.009
 the air itself is taken from the body 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 pass through the radiator and again 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.560
 blown into the hull this way if 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 your body does not have large dimensions and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.210
 good air circulation 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.189
 Organized by coolers, it turns out 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 that such a cooling system will be 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.909
 chase the same size swing 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.759
 warming up and the air in a circle that is 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.579
 no qualitative no cooling 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.829
 will be well most likely in this case 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.170
 the client was led to design by itself 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.000
 name zalman that is, no 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.060
 technical accuracy of fineness 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.140
 did not take into account the second problem 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 which so let 's say served because 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.710
 such an upgrade drank the map and builds 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 that complete thermal grease but here we are 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.220
 just removed the cooler I immediately want 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.340
 to draw your attention to the fact that in the post 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.650
 not applied to the entire surface i.e. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.110
 there are gaps them noticeably on the penny itself 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.670
 radiator their own same spaces 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.390
 clearly visible on the surface of the graphic 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.270
 processor 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.239
 that is, there is such a uniformity 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.050
 application suggests that not with all 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.510
 surface graphic professor 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.110
 CPU goes warm i mean it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.239
 caused overheating here and now about the quality 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 most thermal grease provided in the kit 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.700
 so here it is applied well 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.540
 can be seen as on the graphics processor itself 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.310
 so on the memory chips that when 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.459
 load, in general, is heated very very 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.630
 not bad if we hold the hand 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.090
 observe such an effect 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.380
 that she doesn't even smear with proper 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.209
 thermal grease to call it very hard 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.340
 says this to her low quality therefore 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.360
 we are 1 recommendations that we want to give 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 since you wanted to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.850
 for one reason or another upgrade 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.310
 your card replace the cooling system 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:25.630
 it does not use thermal grease which 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.850
 comes complete mean second when 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.530
 using the cooling system exactly 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.340
 lattice in the model which now 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190
 hold in my hands 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.440
 as I said, I repeat it is necessary 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.310
 very high quality organize 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.660
 air circulation in the enclosure at least 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.549
 need to put a powerful cooler on here 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.900
 this part is very general 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.790
 disassembled system unit 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.829
 it is clear that there is a place under 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.720
 cooler so you will blow and 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.970
 hard drive and supply air from outside to 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.610
 back case necessary 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.440
 to put 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.440
 a fan that would work on 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.030
 blowing out in this way let's say 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.230
 from this point to this is formed 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.840
 draft if I may say so and that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.850
 guarantees that the video card will not 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.920
 scoop up your cooling systems 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.560
 hot air accumulated in the case then 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.079
 there will be no circulation 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.530
 reaching maximum temperatures 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.400
 Well, back to our map and so exits 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.170
 the order was the fact that the first is a hundred 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.919
 interest was not organized 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.780
 case ventilation the second is that 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.250
 used base thermal grease 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.570
 which is not enough in itself 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.730
 low quality 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.000
 because good thermopaste let's say there 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.600
 a tube will cost 20 dollars perhaps 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.760
 not less 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.850
 then in this case complete post it 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.010
 besides not quite having 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.900
 it also has very good properties 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.610
 short duration we recommend 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.169
 when replacing the thermal paste 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.340
 enjoy the thermal paste that goes on 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.990
 silicone based silicone when heated it 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.550
 does not evaporate or 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.610
 at least evaporates but not so 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.940
 quickly well what we see here here 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.820
 let's say the client claimed that this paste 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.229
 six months Well, if for six months post 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.750
 this state comes then 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.050
 no wonder that through here the card is just 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.320
 stopped working means started here 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:32.130
 artifacts this is an obvious intended sign 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.419
 overheating card that's the farthest 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.080
 subsequent failure where required 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:42.020
 replacing an expensive enough chip 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.310
 so every time before doing 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.030
 any upgrade 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.040
 or replacement of the cooling system 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.390
 We recommend all the same advise 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.729
 whether you need it or not from those systems 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.190
 cooling which we say enough 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.760
 productive system can be noted 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.280
 which goes with the turbine this case 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.190
 this is such a system 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.750
 cooling is what is plus and not plus 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.660
 is that most 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.669
 hot air which warmed up for 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.680
 account of what went through the radiator 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.280
 the grid leaves the prize 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.020
 impeller turning would throw it so 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.790
 the cooling system is recognized as one of 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.610
 the noisiest but nonetheless one of 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.919
 the most effective is the first the second is 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.820
 the fact that such a cooling system 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.919
 does not require very good 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.340
 case ventilation because if 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.260
 say that such a system is very 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.200
 noisy then believe me if I have 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.810
 stand cooling system lattice 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.580
 and at the same time normal air circulation 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.910
 that is, at least two more powerful 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.200
 the cooler then the noise will be much more 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.280
 so so independent 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.010
 modernization plus more and waste of money 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.460
 first on the cooling system then on 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.460
 repairs
