00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.089
 good advanced shot this advanced shot 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.830
 what are you going to have to take into account 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.280
 is that good 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.139
 the annoyance more than anything is not that it is 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 it is very difficult that there are 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 separated into good toughs as well 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 to say it they are all missing us more level 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.839
 legend but there are some that are 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 relatively easy others that are 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.429
 well then intermediates and others that are 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.349
 quite complicated but rather 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.539
 complicated the exercise is quite 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 complicated as the number of points as 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.180
 good as you have seen or as 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.980
 you can see for example in the one of faults 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 the free throws this what happens i 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.269
 I would say more than anything is that as you see then 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 you have four minutes or four minutes and 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.829
 peak to complete the exercise and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.989
 Well, you can never get to know 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 if you go well or if you go badly the same when 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 you go in the middle you say good I'm going very 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 bad not so I'm going to restart the exercise 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 no but of course it takes a lot for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.140
 when maybe you realize that you're going 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.670
 not bad especially that it catches you by 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.110
 surprise 'things as they are or that the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.020
 goalkeeper is not in the goal 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.230
 and is to take the trick to each and every one 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 of the plays of course you always go 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.650
 to take into account 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.220
 you will get what you should have in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.130
 account that the volley balls 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.260
 Chileans and all that kind of actions 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.810
 It costs you it costs you enough 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.960
 pretty much above all try to score 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.580
 goal is always worth it because to finish the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 played as soon as possible and that ends in goal 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.710
 it's okay because they're always going to give you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.590
 give you less points so to speak 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.930
 actually good play after play to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.140
 play after play you will go adding 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.060
 worth 700 points is better but that the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 play finish fast and finish in goal is worth 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.080
 not that not for example, well then that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 a play that you spend a lot of time 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.880
 you're wasting time and say goodbye 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.100
 but added 2000 points and that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.200
 you could have put three or three 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.660
 four goals in all that time you 've 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 lost so is to try to finish the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.890
 play as soon as possible 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.240
 I it is true that many times as 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 I stop with 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.740
 I entertain myself doing the same even 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.620
 some dribble of more but you 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.620
 try like this is not against before 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.420
 these shots for example of quality then 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.130
 they are always good when when 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 you stay the same then without that option or 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.960
 these powerful shots from outside the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.510
 area is worth it even if you have less 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.090
 point for less give you less points for 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.830
 they do know that it is true that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.370
 that everything that is added welcome is 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.000
 ok I would rate this exercise 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.630
 let's say intermediate because good 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.180
 the plays are very diverse I do not think 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.400
 make it a very difficult exercise 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.620
 and yes it is true that you are going to have the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.280
 time a little tight limited vale 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 to get that sum of points 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 until you get the legend level 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.660
 I do not know, I could not give you more advice than 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.520
 the one that this is going to be practical 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.640
 practice and practice, you can see 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.230
 how do I do it every since the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.060
 different positions you have as 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.010
 six seven eight different positions 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 here, for example , portage is not in the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.310
 goal what will cost you so 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.310
 say it is going to be that 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.120
 you will not give equal account to the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.770
 principle that the goalie is not in 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.990
 this occasion for example there are times that 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.910
 the goalie usually comes out sometimes yes already 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.890
 Sometimes it's not worth it, you're going to have to 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.270
 keep in mind that if the goalkeeper will 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.520
 it's going to be necessary but the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.610
 lack will not give us points so that 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.110
 you're really going to lose about 1500 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.610
 points for not having thrown by not 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.030
 to have realized that the goalkeeper 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.130
 are you going to take over 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.080
 I do not know the theme of the centers good anymore 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.240
 you know that players head 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.310
 usually go pretty well so I 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.090
 it's always a good option too 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.510
 look for a center and a little bit more, I think 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.040
 who is a good man also then the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.260
 each one's ability of course not and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.270
 each practice and time 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.440
 you can get to dedicate but I 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.380
 it seems like a good exercise 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.400
 intermediate vale is not either 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.739
 exaggeratedly complicated you see that 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.980
 Well, in my list, friends 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.470
 example there are two or more since they have 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.840
 past this level of going like this is that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.860
 Well what I said, I hope that you 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.860
 this helps also
