00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.819 
think the two teams will finish this
season<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.659> spoke<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.200> last<00:02:34.260> year<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
season we spoke about this last year and

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.190 
season we spoke about this last year and
I<00:02:34.889> do<00:02:35.000> think<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.150> would<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.389> sir<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.810> think

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
I do think we would you sir I think

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.509 
I do think we would you sir I think
we're<00:02:37.409> both<00:02:37.530> finishing<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> top<00:02:38.189> four<00:02:38.400> but

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
we're both finishing the top four but

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.399 
we're both finishing the top four but
like<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.849> said<00:02:38.909> last<00:02:39.209> week<00:02:39.329> I<00:02:39.659> think<00:02:40.079> Manchester

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
like I said last week I think Manchester

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.839 
like I said last week I think Manchester
night<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> will<00:02:40.769> finish<00:02:40.889> fed<00:02:41.219> Arsenal<00:02:41.760> will

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
night it will finish fed Arsenal will

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.459 
night it will finish fed Arsenal will
finish<00:02:42.030> fourth<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.540> hope<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.989> finished<00:02:43.139> fourth

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
finish fourth I hope you finished fourth

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.199 
finish fourth I hope you finished fourth
just<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.829> Liverpool<00:02:44.219> don't<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.669> but<00:02:44.939> I

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
just so Liverpool don't get there but I

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.479 
just so Liverpool don't get there but I
think<00:02:45.689> our<00:02:46.049> sum<00:02:46.230> will<00:02:46.349> finish<00:02:46.560> fourth<00:02:46.859> but<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
think our sum will finish fourth but the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.640 
think our sum will finish fourth but the
reason<00:02:48.389> I<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.780> will<00:02:48.900> finish<00:02:49.109> top<00:02:49.349> free

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
reason I think we will finish top free

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.709 
reason I think we will finish top free
is<00:02:50.129> because<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.519> think<00:02:50.579> only<00:02:50.939> Man<00:02:51.299> City<00:02:51.540> and

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
is because I think only Man City and

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.149 
is because I think only Man City and
Chelsea<00:02:52.109> have<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.439> it<00:02:52.530> takes<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.919> get<00:02:53.040> ahead

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
Chelsea have what it takes to get ahead

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.800 
Chelsea have what it takes to get ahead
of<00:02:53.310> Louie<00:02:53.549> van<00:02:53.760> hollen<00:02:54.090> ahead<00:02:54.389> of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.599> players

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
of Louie van hollen ahead of the players

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.539 
of Louie van hollen ahead of the players
