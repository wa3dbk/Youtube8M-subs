00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.420
 I have to do is go to the avant-garde weapons bar that I never know at this time 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 that we are in a beautiful place a beautiful house in the neighborhood of caballito 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:20.060
 After talking to him, Mr. Horacio Osorio, who is the General Director of the O 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.570
 the first question by the way is what does teo mean 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.159
 copperloa chests that as is 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.850
 that meaning of tv 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.470
 p these works on biomolecular double-way roads 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 fundamentally all this name so rude and noble in his name 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.570
 specific 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.410
 what it points to is a cellular order to organize a cellular function 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 in pathologies such as 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.440
 rheumatic diseases 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.010
 Much has been said about this and much is said about 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.140
 the rheumatic pathologies looking different 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.930
 alternative to be able to find relief 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.710
 to people who are suffering and who know 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.380
 who have left will never leave 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.630
 and that until now it can never be true is now has arrived and has arrived 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 since 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.570
 The team of 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.550
 Russian gas writer 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.220
 then before applying in Kuga different countries and today is used throughout Europe 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.149
 almost 13 years that we have been applying are the public 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.219
 in the other country that that type device what ensured its count of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.530
 i this result has been obtained from what is represented by them per cent with 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.570
 this technology 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 very varied in the aspect because we have been changing in the apparatus for 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 as all the technology modify organism that modifying paying a better 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 result 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.090
 I believe that the interested 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.630
 this one because the numbers are very cold 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.760
 I found a puddle of dady cereal with 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.630
 reference in a result control 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.300
 he also knows 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.670
 psst more I would like to tell you and present the people I want a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.910
 possible says 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.739
 a different chance 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.649
 to be able to tackle a disease of these characteristics that is 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.369
 progressive 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.999
 I left negative 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.329
 that is going to pay candú the whole unit is marking the whole body more that of 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.559
 that start a certain area is taking all patient 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.489
 and that they happen again doing taking medication and trying to alleviate and in 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.239
 that side the thing in the best way that can 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.199
 today he has a different pose 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.809
 of not taking medication 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.999
 of not using any type of fet and massive 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.999
 Chávez and insertions in this farm vines 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.959
 all that kind of thing is the possible new different this therapy has to 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.229
 see with fabrics and remember 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.259
 it has to do with one 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:56.779
 nurses got fed up a yes sustained disorder of time seems like a symptom 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.449
 and that symptom what we have to correct 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.499
 percent today we have the possibility of 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.530
 able to treat these rheumatic diseases without any kind of 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:07.609
 medication 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.799
 without any side effects if no side effects 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.729
 and fundamentally where the person from the moment of finding this 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.779
 is going to go gradually his had in mind finding functional changes less 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:21.519
 pain 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.839
 more mobility 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.839
 better anti-inflammatory process 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.709
 We do not think that it is finding a little light in the background the way that 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.619
 this moment I could not stand it according to panji there is also something that is very 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.349
 important since with 3 percent and if there is a patient that is still here 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.119
 taking some medication 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.249
 does not take away the medication directly in three phases the treatment with the 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:48.039
 medication that patient is taking cpi the improvement is noted that 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.900
 he has to be noticing he is leaving the medicines 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.800
 Obviously not the name of polydicastic unemployment, lucia is scarce, 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.599
 amounts 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.599
 the patient who take out those bags and their delegations 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.369
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.209
 we do not use a consensus 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.559
 we shelter 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.509
 medication what are we going to do from the medical department control the 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.039
 medication is taking 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.489
 possible to your general practitioner 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.450
 the patient is in better condition and can regulate the medication 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.729
 what are you taking 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.430
 that is why there is a supply of the city 100% here m the price of the initiative 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.840
 biomolecular have 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.319
 medical staff 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.039
 important hooker 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.039
 doctors kinesiologists psychologists 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.949
 as well as by the containment of percent 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.009
 percent 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.689
 in fact that 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.939
 well then this one I would like 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.569
 viviana that the medical director this one will participate in the talk 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.509
 and all the teachers immediately afterwards had such a budget 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.289
 we invite you to internalize participate 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.960
 good can you give us your experience camdessus and Jesus restlessness but 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.550
 I repeat we continue talking with you now we are going to speak where he graduated 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.680
 explanations percent in that of bilateral patients still has it 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.840
 you can apply 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.840
 the winners 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.349
 all in the ica of all charges except the escorial 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.419
 His Followers 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.099
 if we put gh 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.559
 actually by the way other people account we are 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.710
 eleven 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.970
 that's why the pathologies percent and mostly you understand people feel 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.319
 good at the head of the portfolio or césar pérez becerril each class is men 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.780
 recognize hand kadeer current administration --balance present in 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.080
 anywhere in our body where a joint is to show 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.090
 process for each of them 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.319
 2 behind the duck what is already the 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.500
 all the power available to the patient 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.960
 makes the project draft an estimated time in how much time it starts to 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.619
 feel discomfort 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:33.470
 in the afternoon 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.330
 the baby actually a bit of the evolution that they have had previously 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.770
 with the pathology 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.930
 to integrate changes in change that are not going to be maintained over time 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.189
 we achieved within two weeks of treatment 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:52.059
 there are people who have a lot more response before but really the average is a 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.689
 Cancer treatment baby begins to feel the slag 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.009
 we found a very important cancer 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.199
 that not only are changes at the level of an articulation but that it changed in 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.350
 is round in everything the quality of life of the patient 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.129
 basseterre the sound of bribery 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:16.629
 by the way a medication that is applied in the city of elche this treatment 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:17.449
 of beauty
