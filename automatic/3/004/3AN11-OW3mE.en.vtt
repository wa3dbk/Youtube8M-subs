called espania to Egypt and it's gonna
be<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.490> time<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.060> go<00:01:39.420> from

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
be the first time that I go from

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
be the first time that I go from
somewhere<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> UK<00:01:41.640> essentially

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
somewhere that's not the UK essentially

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
somewhere that's not the UK essentially
so<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.420> starting<00:01:42.810> off<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:42.960> Spain<00:01:43.409> because

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
so we're starting off in Spain because

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
so we're starting off in Spain because
that's<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> finished<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.240> our<00:01:45.420> last

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that's where we finished up our last

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440 
that's where we finished up our last
theories<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.470> we're<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> drive<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
theories and we're going to drive in a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.230 
theories and we're going to drive in a
sort<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> easterly<00:01:49.200> direction<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.890> think

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
sort of easterly direction I think

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.569 
sort of easterly direction I think
towards<00:01:51.240> Egypt<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.280> hopefully<00:01:53.280> we're<00:01:53.460> going

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
towards Egypt and hopefully we're going

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
towards Egypt and hopefully we're going
to<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.030> some<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.570> awesome<00:01:54.829> TSM<00:01:55.829> map

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to take in some of the awesome TSM map

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.760 
to take in some of the awesome TSM map
that<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.460> haven't<00:01:56.790> seen<00:01:56.880> before<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.810> we're

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that we haven't seen before and we're

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
that we haven't seen before and we're
going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> experience<00:01:59.579> Italy<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> lots<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
