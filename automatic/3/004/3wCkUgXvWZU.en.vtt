00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.779
 and 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.040
 very good I went to bed here in rivers came a 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.560
 new video of pokemones gáldar that that 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.390
 today we are not in the expeditious that 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.670
 bother the critic already already the league then 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
 not today we are in a video apart a 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.000
 video which would be very useful for the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.550
 people who surf genre is 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.669
 stagnant a gym or the league 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.880
 Pokemon is a video to upload fast from 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.300
 level you can do was had with a maximum 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.890
 of 3 pokemons at the same time and it's a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.350
 trick between quotes as it is a way 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.610
 totally legal to raise the level that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.950
 Many people have lived to tell me 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.170
 now people that you want already know it 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.090
 maybe I do not know, but I'm going to 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.700
 as they say I've done and have me 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.550
 been very very useful for example here you see 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.500
 that this two clubs I had and had 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.330
 before level 27 and m from a quarter of 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.670
 hour 20 minutes is getting it up 11 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.970
 levels so before we used like this or 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.320
 cough me pokemon type of flight is 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.049
 to say that he gives me I was wrong 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.990
 Instead forgiveness have to say that goes into this 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.259
 type of trick is totally mandatory 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.710
 have flight and is highly recommended so 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.260
 that you will see 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 but we also need to have the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.940
 two pokemons there in the carved quarry 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 in the way of why we will only have one 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.390
 pokémon rising level of form 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.479
 active and the other two we have them 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.740
 passive way in the daycare while 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.970
 these two because we show in the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.890
 nursery and now I have stove 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.570
 rising yesterday in the guard when he 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.290
 make me go up to see 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.770
 to see one up ten levels and the other 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.360
 11 So I was very good with 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.250
 people like I say while this I'm in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.830
 the nursery will have another pokemon that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 this case for me these clubs together with a 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.490
 pokémon of the level far greater than the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.070
 which in this case is a play follow of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.530
 962 that 's because I want these two 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 so differentiated levels very easy 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.970
 because it 's cool or two I think in this 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.800
 In this case, it will be much higher than the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.250
 other or whatever it help you gain 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.100
 level 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.080
 they talk about this two and one we use 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.050
 flight to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.900
 could the band once here we go 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.160
 direct this then I will do it very 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.230
 quick that you see is much faster 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 what it looks like and a people go here 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
 so 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 from here we go down to these payments 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.940
 here in plan that pussy you know if you can 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.770
 seem very weird but really when 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 you have very hard fought against them 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.290
 you know look who these guys have 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 which is quite heavy have levels to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 see 39 that is quite pretty 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.830
 well do not you think that these levels you will say 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.750
 and what can it do for me? 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.600
 while one hits have you in quotes 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 the other makes it false that nothing 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.470
 does nothing but we interpret 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.140
 that I'm doing something so it's so 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.570
 easy as to wait for the one they do worth yes 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.560
 just as we are going to this step that 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.750
 is going to fix because it does not interest 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.940
 a lot but me so a camera goes by 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.570
 mercy and you see that we have achieved that 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.010
 go up a level the clubs products then 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.990
 we continue and that I have to do that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.540
 everything is all the same do not avoid us in 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.090
 all the same now we have to catch by 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.430
 again go to the balona once to malaga 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.850
 to the canvas we go again 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.640
 quickly here that uses surfing 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.090
 up here we use surf we got here 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.550
 and we will find them then 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.820
 we go back to fight against them and that 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.550
 came to be the trick itself sources is 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.720
 very useful to me has been very very useful 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.190
 because while we are 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.769
 fighting trucks behind very 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.700
 we quickly have two pokemons in the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.069
 daycare leveling up 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.900
 but does the same here right now I 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:51.069
 makes life go this way 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 embers and a shadow shit because nothing 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.030
 is completely level because in addition 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.010
 I also advise the view I have not 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.900
 said is that the pokemon figueres and up 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.060
 level experience leading deliverers 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.849
 because then I was going even more experience 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.400
 and therefore we are going to use flight and 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.620
 our next destination will be here in 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.970
 dawn city is not from here we see by 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.600
 the lianas get on and we go 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.480
 quickly let's do here 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.240
 then we run running and the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.720
 running volcanoes is the best thing towards 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.520
 here and you will see again this couple 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.050
 then I'm going to ask you to fight and 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.270
 if you messed up because I did not 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.730
 in the others here and more here the shadow 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.310
 do not know anything but from walt you live 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.530
 life is attacked visited very well in 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.190
 raise the level almost not but you have to 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.810
 let's go up 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.990
 only to go up we have lived I think I 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.540
 pesos at level 40 we have gone up in that 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.040
 nothing all levels so end so 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.260
 that I do not want to record with him and 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.760
 then we go to the cinema the way in the 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.860
 which it followed a very easy way 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.380
 because the people that at your level to my life 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.790
 it will be from pc that I do not know about pc I can not 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.590
 do as fast and achieve as I have 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.540
 I made myself slow in quotes because 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.880
 we have not achieved anything but if 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.320
 you want to make the trick even faster 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.000
 is the special bar now it's late what 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.320
 well look at you see how fast I do it 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 so here 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.800
 what do we do 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.610
 have done the mission less now before 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:26.360
 to see a fast camera if it will be much more 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.360
 fast yours seriously 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.979
 Yes again 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.310
 through if you see 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.680
 here 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.310
 A) Yes 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.879
 we will fight like this so excellent and 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.919
 It is also advisable while and stop 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.259
 somewhere to rest because 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.470
 restored ps will be all that is another 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.110
 we have managed to hear this 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.750
 forgiven I do not want it so it does not matter 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.330
 this can not happen in the middle of a 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.330
 combat is pure realism 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.530
 flight 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.320
 here 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.270
 also sometimes 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.050
 here 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:24.050
 others we will fight for a few days 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.330
 about ten years ago 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.440
 You know the bye days 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.909
 that has been the trick rather than a trick is 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.620
 a quick easy way and for all the 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.750
 family level up in pokemones 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.639
 my side the more or less quickly 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.189
 yes, I am, the treaty 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.139
 many times because if not the 29 not 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:54.590
 appear appear at a lower level 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:57.680
 but through struggles struggles in the 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.469
 struggles you will get these levels more 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.000
 high afterwards help a lot to climb 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.530
 of level as I say since two 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.870
 huge university for a bit of level 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.580
 40 39 well it's pretty enough no 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.710
 you think so people for that now 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.599
 let's do if you want to look once more at 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.520
 those because we had in the nursery what 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:15.789
 as i tell you 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.229
 will keep the state of knowing well 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:20.180
 you will have the cured cones in nothing or 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.370
 in a pispás other ions healed and like this 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.370
 that simple easy for the whole family 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.669
 do not you think we're going to give here to see how 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.319
 we are pokemons to see 17 good do not know 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.210
 will question move too much the tan 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.430
 little time but when you do three or 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.259
 four races go up two levels a 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.449
 level so you know where pretty well 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:41.389
 I wanted to go changing a little bit 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.680
 act now he for us I have 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.060
 spent a while doing this and it has 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.550
 cost many leaders what 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.460
 I remember 100% I hope you liked it 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.370
 this video a like and a favor 2 help me 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.620
 very much and see you in another video 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.090
 emerald pokemon instead so 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.090
 people goodbye to another
