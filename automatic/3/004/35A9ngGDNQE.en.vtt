00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
first impressions obviously the steering

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.589 
first impressions obviously the steering
makes<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.530> big

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
makes a big

coming through

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.880 
coming through
much<00:00:14.429> easier<00:00:14.990> you<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.080> less<00:00:16.289> fatigue<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
much easier you know less fatigue in the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
much easier you know less fatigue in the
arms<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.090> know<00:00:18.210> hopping<00:00:18.480> from<00:00:18.750> one

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
arms and you know hopping from one

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.630 
arms and you know hopping from one
machine<00:00:19.110> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> next<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.070> notice<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> big

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
machine to the next you can notice a big

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.089 
machine to the next you can notice a big
big<00:00:20.820> difference<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:22.410> electronic<00:00:22.950> power

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
big difference so the electronic power

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.550 
big difference so the electronic power
steering<00:00:23.220> makes<00:00:23.759> you<00:00:24.360> know<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.599> vector<00:00:25.230> much

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
steering makes you know the vector much

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
steering makes you know the vector much

different physical attributes and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.660 
different physical attributes and
sometimes<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.540> find<00:00:37.010> you'll<00:00:38.010> get<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.460> some

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sometimes I find you'll get like some

through the snow really really nicely
found<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:53.039> easy<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.579> handle<00:00:53.999> a<00:00:54.179> very<00:00:54.719> nice

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
found it very easy to handle a very nice

muscles<00:01:00.569> I<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.260> been<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
muscles I could have been going for a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
muscles I could have been going for a
couple<00:01:02.339> of<00:01:02.609> days<00:01:02.989> big<00:01:03.989> improvement<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.440> last

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
couple of days big improvement over last

couple of days big improvement over last
year's<00:01:04.920> machine<00:01:05.280> lightened<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
year's machine lightened up got the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.430 
year's machine lightened up got the
front<00:01:06.900> end<00:01:07.080> planted<00:01:08.600> took<00:01:09.600> any<00:01:09.780> any<00:01:10.050> fatigue

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
front end planted took any any fatigue

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.130 
front end planted took any any fatigue
any<00:01:10.800> major<00:01:11.010> feedback<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.840> trail

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
any major feedback out of it any trail

any major feedback out of it any trail
bumps<00:01:13.729> overall<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.850> big<00:01:15.030> improvement

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.249 

but<00:01:20.189> necessary<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.060> less<00:01:21.259> negative

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
but necessary it's you get less negative

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
but necessary it's you get less negative
feedback<00:01:22.799> through<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> bars<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.420> get

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
feedback through the bars you don't get

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
feedback through the bars you don't get
the<00:01:24.600> jolts<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> normally<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.799> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the jolts that you normally would you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
the jolts that you normally would you
still<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.630> positive<00:01:28.380> connection<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
still have a positive connection to the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
still have a positive connection to the
slide<00:01:29.789> you<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:29.939> still<00:01:30.149> feel<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.509> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
slide you could still feel it really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
slide you could still feel it really
well<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.549> makes<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> steering

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
well it's just it makes the steering

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
well it's just it makes the steering
after<00:01:33.299> way<00:01:33.630> easier

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
after way easier

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.830 
after way easier
and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.579> there's<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:35.939> improvement<00:01:36.149> in<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and then there's an improvement in in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
and then there's an improvement in in
handling<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.320> well<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.819> front

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
handling as well you can get the front

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
handling as well you can get the front
end<00:01:39.060> planted<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.569> lot<00:01:39.689> better

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.190 

I<00:01:43.820> think<00:01:44.820> every<00:01:45.150> slide<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
I think every slide should have this to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.890 
I think every slide should have this to
be<00:01:46.230> honest<00:01:46.620> with<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.270> Drive<00:01:48.870> a

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
be honest with you like I I Drive a

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.620 
be honest with you like I I Drive a
variety<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.800> different<00:01:50.010> sleds<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.910> really

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
variety of different sleds and I really

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
variety of different sleds and I really
think<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:51.960> every<00:01:52.590> sled<00:01:52.920> should<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.790> quick

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
think that every sled should be quick

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
think that every sled should be quick
with<00:01:54.330> power<00:01:54.600> steering<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.400> bomb<00:01:56.580> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
with power steering it's it's the bomb I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
with power steering it's it's the bomb I
think<00:01:57.720> other<00:01:58.320> manufacturers<00:01:59.220> will<00:01:59.340> probably

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
think other manufacturers will probably

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.070 
think other manufacturers will probably
follow<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.910> trend<00:02:00.150> as<00:02:00.270> he<00:02:00.360> did<00:02:00.510> with<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.840> in

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
follow the trend as he did with the in

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080 
follow the trend as he did with the in
the<00:02:01.170> atv<00:02:01.620> world<00:02:01.890> where<00:02:02.220> they'll<00:02:02.430> most<00:02:02.970> likely

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the atv world where they'll most likely

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870 
the atv world where they'll most likely
all<00:02:03.560> four<00:02:04.560> manufacturers<00:02:05.190> will<00:02:05.369> offer<00:02:05.550> power

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
all four manufacturers will offer power

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
all four manufacturers will offer power
steering<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> future<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.350> some<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.650> their

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
steering in the future and some of their

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.949 
steering in the future and some of their
models<00:02:08.100> oh<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.880> would<00:02:09.179> think<00:02:09.209> power<00:02:09.570> steering

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
models oh I would think power steering

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
models oh I would think power steering
would<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:11.070> know<00:02:11.160> following<00:02:11.580> suit<00:02:11.880> here

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
would be you know following suit here

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.730 
would be you know following suit here
with<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> other<00:02:12.390> manufacturers<00:02:13.230> Yamaha<00:02:13.680> has

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
with the other manufacturers Yamaha has

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.560 
with the other manufacturers Yamaha has
kind<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> been<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.220> leader<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.790> power

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
kind of been the leader in power

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.810 
kind of been the leader in power
steering<00:02:15.900> starting<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.380> ATV<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.370> they

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
steering starting in ATV and and they

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.940 
steering starting in ATV and and they
kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> fall<00:02:18.300> suit<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.350> can't<00:02:19.830> see

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
kind of fall suit there so I can't see

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.979 
kind of fall suit there so I can't see
why<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:20.160> wouldn't<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> same<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:21.660> after

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
why they wouldn't do the same here after

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.990 
why they wouldn't do the same here after
they've<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.100> seen<00:02:23.160> what<00:02:23.400> Yamaha<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.820> done

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
they've kind of seen what Yamaha is done

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.940 
they've kind of seen what Yamaha is done
I<00:02:24.209> think<00:02:24.690> once<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.050> get<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.440> try<00:02:25.650> on

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I think once you get out and try on

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.440 
I think once you get out and try on
there<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.489> your<00:02:26.670> local<00:02:26.850> dealer<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
there you go to your local dealer and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.850 
there you go to your local dealer and
you<00:02:27.600> know<00:02:27.720> try<00:02:27.989> their<00:02:28.170> demo<00:02:28.350> model<00:02:28.800> or

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you know try their demo model or

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.410 
you know try their demo model or
something<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.459> mean<00:02:29.550> you'll<00:02:29.880> notice<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> huge

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
something I mean you'll notice a huge

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.840 
something I mean you'll notice a huge
difference<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.440> would<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.650> an<00:02:32.130> ATV

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
difference just like you would on an ATV

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.930 
difference just like you would on an ATV
or<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:33.989> now<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.650> snowmobiles<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.489> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
or you know now on the snowmobiles so I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.050 
or you know now on the snowmobiles so I
think<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.570> makes<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.840> big<00:02:37.020> big<00:02:37.050> difference<00:02:37.230> and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
think it makes a big big difference and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:48.430 
think it makes a big big difference and
it's<00:02:39.060> kudos<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> yellow<00:02:40.080> Hawk<00:02:40.320> for<00:02:40.620> doing<00:02:40.830> it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.500
