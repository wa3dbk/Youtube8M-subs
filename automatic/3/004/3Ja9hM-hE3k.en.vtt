other things so filter animation we're
going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> blend<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
going to do a blend and I'm going to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
going to do a blend and I'm going to
whack<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.840> 10<00:01:16.229> frames<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
whack that out to 10 frames and I'm

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.710 
whack that out to 10 frames and I'm
going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> increase<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> blur<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
going to increase the blur because that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.350 
going to increase the blur because that
actually<00:01:18.869> makes<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> look<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.100> better

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
actually makes it look a little better

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
click OK and it does its thing and now

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
click OK and it does its thing and now
with<00:01:26.700> GIMP<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> gap<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
with GIMP and gap you have to have the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
with GIMP and gap you have to have the
swf<00:01:29.790> tools<00:01:30.119> installed

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 

and<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:35.250> easy<00:01:35.520> enough<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.270> find

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and that's easy enough to go and find

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.770 
and that's easy enough to go and find
it's<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.229> Python<00:01:37.680> script<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> search<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.780> swf

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it's a Python script do a search for swf

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.300 
it's a Python script do a search for swf
tools<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.390> there's<00:01:46.049> actually<00:01:46.470> another

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
tools and there's actually another

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.070 
tools and there's actually another
script<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.180> trying<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> remember<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> name

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
script I'm trying to remember the name

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.620 
script I'm trying to remember the name
of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.350> guy<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.880> exports<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.770> swf<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> that's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
of the guy that exports as swf so that's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
of the guy that exports as swf so that's
what<00:01:54.750> we're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.140> next<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.100> now

animation I'm going to create the XHTML
I'm<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.430> open<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.700> browser<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
I'm going to open a browser when it's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.300 
I'm going to open a browser when it's
done<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:28.290> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> whack<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.980> frame

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
done and I'm going to whack the frame

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.710 
done and I'm going to whack the frame
right<00:02:29.489> down<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:31.250> click<00:02:32.250> ok<00:02:32.610> now<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.480> have

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
right down to one click ok now you have

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.840 
right down to one click ok now you have
to<00:02:33.840> go<00:02:33.930> into<00:02:34.140> python<00:02:34.650> script<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.130> modify

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
to go into python script actually modify

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.150 
to go into python script actually modify
that<00:02:36.150> because<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.230> guy<00:02:37.440> who<00:02:37.500> wrote<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that because the guy who wrote the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.729 
that because the guy who wrote the
script<00:02:38.430> set<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.880> at<00:02:39.000> 12<00:02:39.360> which<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.680> too

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
script set it at 12 which was way too

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.250 
script set it at 12 which was way too
fast

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.319 

and<00:02:46.069> we're<00:02:46.730> at<00:02:46.909> 28<00:02:47.450> 29<00:02:47.870> 30<00:02:48.530> etc<00:02:49.430> etc<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:49.909> we<00:02:50.180> can

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
and we're at 28 29 30 etc etc so we can

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.380 
and we're at 28 29 30 etc etc so we can
check<00:02:50.569> over<00:02:50.870> here<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.560> are<00:02:51.769> 66<00:02:52.670> frames<00:02:53.030> in

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
check over here there are 66 frames in

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
check over here there are 66 frames in
this<00:02:53.540> particular<00:02:54.310> simple<00:02:55.310> animation<00:02:55.879> I've

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
this particular simple animation I've

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270 
this particular simple animation I've
done<00:02:56.239> nothing<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.379> simple<00:02:57.769> blend

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
done nothing this is just a simple blend

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.819 
done nothing this is just a simple blend
blur<00:02:59.019> a<00:03:00.019> slideshow<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.760> flash<00:03:02.599> or<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.709> will

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
blur a slideshow for flash or that will

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.440 
blur a slideshow for flash or that will
be<00:03:03.950> exported<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.400> flash<00:03:04.849> when<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.269> done

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
be exported to flash when it's done

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.039 
be exported to flash when it's done
which<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.170> now<00:03:06.530> done<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.760> now<00:03:08.209> chrome

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
which it is now done and now chrome

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.539 
which it is now done and now chrome
should<00:03:09.379> launch<00:03:10.090> here<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.269> moment<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:13.159> does

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
should launch here in a moment it does

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.020 
should launch here in a moment it does
and<00:03:13.970> there's<00:03:14.689> our<00:03:15.069> very<00:03:16.069> simple<00:03:16.489> animation

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and there's our very simple animation

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.949 
and there's our very simple animation
and<00:03:17.629> you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:17.959> see<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.510> know<00:03:20.569> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
and you can see that it's you know the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.289 
and you can see that it's you know the
frame<00:03:21.290> itself<00:03:21.620> or<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.099> size<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.940> actually

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
frame itself or the size is actually

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.990 
frame itself or the size is actually
probably<00:03:23.629> too<00:03:23.930> large<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:25.010> again<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.489> warned

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
probably too large but again I warned

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.979 
probably too large but again I warned
you<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.329> that's<00:03:26.540> what<00:03:26.750> it's<00:03:26.840> going<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
you of that that's what it's going to

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.339 
you of that that's what it's going to
look<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:28.269> but<00:03:29.269> there<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.599> it's<00:03:29.930> going<00:03:30.139> to

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
look like but there it is it's going to

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.899 
look like but there it is it's going to
just<00:03:30.500> cycle<00:03:30.920> through<00:03:30.950> those<00:03:31.280> images<00:03:31.579> with

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
just cycle through those images with

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.309 
just cycle through those images with
blends<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.450> blurs<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:34.359> we're<00:03:35.359> done<00:03:35.599> thanks

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
blends and blurs and we're done thanks

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.030 
blends and blurs and we're done thanks
for<00:03:36.440> watching<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.190> happy<00:03:37.639> computing
