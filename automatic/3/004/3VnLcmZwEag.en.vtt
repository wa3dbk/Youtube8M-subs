00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
can look at their toenails and you can

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.620 
can look at their toenails and you can
see<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> broken<00:02:05.040> toe<00:02:05.520> nail<00:02:05.820> you

can see if they have a toenail that's
grown<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:12.660> can

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
grown in you can

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.220 
grown in you can
under<00:02:13.860> their<00:02:14.040> paws<00:02:14.900> occasionally<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.960> takes<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
under their paws occasionally it takes a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.590 
under their paws occasionally it takes a
little<00:02:16.410> help<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.340> even<00:02:17.820> because<00:02:18.480> it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
little help with this even because it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.740 
little help with this even because it
takes<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:19.050> hands<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.770> really<00:02:20.450> explore<00:02:21.450> things

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
takes two hands to really explore things

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.320 
takes two hands to really explore things
so<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:22.530> someone<00:02:22.890> else<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.280> scruffing<00:02:23.760> them<00:02:23.940> for

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
so if someone else is scruffing them for

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 
so if someone else is scruffing them for
you<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.080> easier<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.640> check

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
you then it's easier but you can check

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.490 
you then it's easier but you can check
between<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.450> toes<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.200> remove<00:02:28.650> things<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
between the toes and remove things and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.900 
between the toes and remove things and
and<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.770> do<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> same<00:02:32.250> thing<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

and you can do the same thing with the
back<00:02:33.150> feet<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.070> also<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.640> turn<00:02:35.910> them<00:02:36.090> over
