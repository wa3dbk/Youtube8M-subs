you<00:00:10.550> write<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.880> psalm<00:00:11.349> 760<00:00:12.460> 2/3<00:00:16.240> second<00:00:17.240> you

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
you write the psalm 760 2/3 second you

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.810 
you write the psalm 760 2/3 second you
write<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.080> bus-stop<00:00:18.529> method<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.610> bigger

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
write the bus-stop method the bigger

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.310 
write the bus-stop method the bigger
number<00:00:20.330> which<00:00:20.779> is<00:00:21.110> 760<00:00:22.099> 2<00:00:22.669> goes<00:00:23.390> inside<00:00:23.840> with

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
number which is 760 2 goes inside with

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.409 
number which is 760 2 goes inside with
the<00:00:24.439> box<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.400> smaller<00:00:25.730> number<00:00:26.090> which<00:00:26.239> is

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
the box and the smaller number which is

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.830 
the box and the smaller number which is
sitting<00:00:26.660> he<00:00:26.840> goes<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.349> side<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:29.360> work<00:00:29.570> how

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
sitting he goes on the side you work how

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.250 
sitting he goes on the side you work how
how<00:00:30.290> many<00:00:30.349> times<00:00:30.980> 3<00:00:31.430> goes<00:00:31.700> into<00:00:31.880> 7<00:00:32.329> 3<00:00:32.840> goes<00:00:33.050> into

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
how many times 3 goes into 7 3 goes into

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.370 
how many times 3 goes into 7 3 goes into
7<00:00:33.739> 2<00:00:34.340> times<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.059> there<00:00:35.329> is<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.450> remainder<00:00:35.840> of<00:00:35.960> 1

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
7 2 times and there is a remainder of 1

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.740 
7 2 times and there is a remainder of 1
so<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:36.890> carry<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.030> maximum<00:00:38.329> by<00:00:38.600> which

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
so you carry it to the maximum by which

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.810 
so you carry it to the maximum by which
is<00:00:38.960> 6

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
is 6

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.850 
is 6
there<00:00:40.820> was<00:00:40.969> a<00:00:41.000> remainder<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.600> 1<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.530> number

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
there was a remainder of 1 so the number

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.500 
there was a remainder of 1 so the number
6<00:00:43.160> has<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:43.850> changed<00:00:44.210> into<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.810> number<00:00:45.110> 16<00:00:46.510> you

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
6 has now changed into the number 16 you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.160 
6 has now changed into the number 16 you
check<00:00:47.810> how<00:00:48.050> many<00:00:48.110> times<00:00:48.650> 3<00:00:49.550> goes<00:00:49.850> into<00:00:50.030> 16<00:00:50.360> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
check how many times 3 goes into 16 it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.260 
check how many times 3 goes into 16 it
goes<00:00:51.440> into<00:00:51.800> 16<00:00:52.220> five<00:00:52.490> times<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.120> still

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
goes into 16 five times and you still

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.020 
goes into 16 five times and you still
have<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.630> remainder<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:54.260> 1<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:55.820> have<00:00:56.000> a

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
have a remainder of 1 so you have a

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.900 
have a remainder of 1 so you have a
remainder<00:00:56.450> of<00:00:56.690> 1<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:57.650> make<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.190> true<00:00:58.400> into

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
remainder of 1 so you make the true into

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
remainder of 1 so you make the true into
the<00:00:59.390> number<00:00:59.690> 12<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.460> see<00:01:01.640> how<00:01:01.850> many<00:01:02.180> times<00:01:02.540> 3

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
the number 12 you see how many times 3

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
the number 12 you see how many times 3
goes<00:01:03.170> into<00:01:03.410> 12<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:04.159> goes<00:01:04.399> into<00:01:04.699> 12<00:01:05.000> 4<00:01:05.420> times<00:01:08.950> you

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
goes into 12 it goes into 12 4 times you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.590 
goes into 12 it goes into 12 4 times you
for<00:01:10.159> all<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.520> answers<00:01:10.850> together<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.420> your

for all the answers together and your

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.959 
for all the answers together and your
answer<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.549> 254<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:16.100> check<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.579> have<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.850> do

answer is 254 to check you have to do

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:26.630 
answer is 254 to check you have to do
the<00:01:17.119> inverse<00:01:17.299> operation<00:01:18.139> which<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.649> time

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

to<00:01:31.750> check<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.229> have<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.470> do<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.740> inverse

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
to check you have to do the inverse

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.910 
to check you have to do the inverse
operation<00:01:33.759> which<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.270> timesing<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.590> soma

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
operation which is timesing and the soma
