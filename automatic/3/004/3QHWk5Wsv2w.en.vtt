00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 no 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.359
 hi today we prepare a rice dish 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.970
 of the sauteed rice 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.980
 here it is, we do it with artichokes 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.530
 however you can do with any vegetables 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.829
 very good made with broccoli made 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.079
 with with turnip tops made with the 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.640
 cauliflower with any vegetable i 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.210
 this day I would like to do it with i 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.579
 artichokes we start immediately to take a 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.100
 put to cook our rice 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.790
 of course a rice a boiled rice 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.890
 you can do if you like it I prefer 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.850
 the normal one our Italian resolve 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.590
 but if you want and operate what 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.590
 I don't overdo it, I could use it 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.050
 saying a brand but I can't and that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.700
 squash center from salted to you me 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.960
 I prefer this one anyway 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 normal rice from da da da dry 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.270
 meanwhile our rice is 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.630
 cooking we take the artichokes and 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.020
 the Italian with quite fine spikes 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.890
 because because we will make them boil 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 along with the rice as soon as it arrives at 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.239
 three quarters of cooking after 10 minutes 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.729
 about up here we are here I would say that in 

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:42.569
 this case a nice carcioff each is 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.569
 more than enough 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 as you see here as you see here 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.619
 I peeled anti-handles because if 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.739
 they are beautiful and these are tender 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:05.080
 very tasty we can use them 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:08.470
 very well peeled there with the potato peeler ad 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 headband and this is a big one is a nice one 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.860
 saving 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.440
 here we are 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.000
 let's put it all here 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.709
 a little crowded but there is no one knows it is 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.989
 a very simple dish but honestly 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.599
 a really tasty dish really 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.760
 that we will say so can become very well 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.970
 a single dish if we are close to it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:46.700
 let's assume something meat or something 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:48.080
 of cheeses here have passed in ten 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 minutes from the moment we entered 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.660
 rice in salted water 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:04.010
 so here we are now inserting the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:06.080
 artichokes breathe artichokes and get up 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.920
 even slightly the fire so that 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.019
 the water I don't lose myself of bolloré as 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.130
 you saw I inserted the artichokes very much 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.430
 later as those four o 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.160
 five minutes cut fine as they are 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.720
 we can cook them but also 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.000
 stay al dente because that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.890
 important that the vegetables remain 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.670
 al dente because the vegetables are overcooked 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.549
 in my opinion it does not lose almost everything well 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.530
 okay that here it is absorbed by rice 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.260
 from the water and rice, however, we will say 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.959
 so the taste loses a lot of it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.870
 when the vegetables are too much copies 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.700
 here in this case we have put the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.620
 artichokes in water or any 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.480
 other thing we put in the water with 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.680
 the pasta with the rice we are making 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.180
 he said we will say so that vitamins 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.030
 they go into the water because they are 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.340
 water-soluble and are absorbed 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.400
 from water than pasta or rice 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.940
 it absorbs so we don't lose I would say almost 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.940
 nothing 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.330
 here we are 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.560
 now we are waiting for the whole thing 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.560
 cook but we're not there yet 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.000
 I would say that we are therefore 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.110
 let's drain everything we are lightly 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.160
 soft we put it in the pan where 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.340
 I melted a knob of butter e 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.700
 disgust and brown a clove of garlic 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.530
 oil garlic here who likes it can 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.530
 put it who doesn't like it don't put it 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:02.580
 let's go down the fire 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:06.140
 let's take a nice parsley do yes 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.140
 that everything is flavored 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.599
 here it is 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.690
 done 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.350
 I call our sautéed rice and artichokes 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.480
 as you see a very simple dish from 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.000
 I would say very good 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.100
 plus whoever wants to put can put 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.320
 of Parmesan or you also want that 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.540
 both those who like pecorino 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.450
 here our dish can be good 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.870
 with any cheese better if a 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.280
 cheese we would say so local with this 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.570
 I seem to have said everything to you 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.460
 thank you for your time 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.420
 dedicated and as always to god liking 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.140
 see you tomorrow 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.140
 Hello
