00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.519
 that I want 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.719
 come on 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 Hello girls 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.189
 I'm going to teach you a hairstyle today. 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 For those who want to wear their hair loose, but 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 same time take some of the face and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.420
 stay super beautiful you separate a wick 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 from the front of your hair 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.820
 divided into three parts makes a braided 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.489
 normal and will start to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.180
 only the wicks from the top of the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 your hair is a braid 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 a braid hairstyle but it 's a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.920
 hidden braid that in the end there you 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 They'll know what I 'm talking about then. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.660
 the hair should be clear as 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.660
 for any other hairstyle and if ever 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.449
 very important you will get the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.940
 from the top along with the side and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.400
 passes under the middle strand 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 The embedded braid technique has several 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.360
 videos on the channel teaching the step to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 step of the braid built in if you want 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 check 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 give me a look at this square that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.850
 will appear there watch the video that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 You will know the step by step well. 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.580
 in detail very well right 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 So you'll make it stick 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.799
 Hair mechinha the top 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.430
 next to the side goes under the wick 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.100
 from the middle to the other in china you do not inlay 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.460
 nothing from that bottom of your hair 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.310
 only from above upwards or downwards 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.649
 yes, so you take your hair off 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.439
 face and at the same time you stay 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.790
 neat and cool 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.790
 easy to do 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 of the ones you do in a minute and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.159
 how it's up front you can do it yourself 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.030
 in a year depends on another person like that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 to do with a little of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.799
 skill and will power and there you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.720
 then can you end with a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.979
 normal simple twig that does not have 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.319
 mystery none of that everyone 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.510
 knows how to do 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.499
 with silicone elastic of the color of your 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.139
 hair I'll do the same thing there. 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:23.659
 on the other hand, I'm going to accelerate the 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:26.900
 stay too long but it's just like 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:30.260
 I did it here and then I'll show you I'll come back 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.299
 to teach how to hold back and one 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.409
 Legal tip also that the pain center 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.379
 after the tam is ready you pull only 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.180
 and pulling each strand of the braid 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.159
 every one of you because it gives a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.159
 very beautiful effect both for those who have 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.500
 hair pretty much like for who 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.959
 it also gives the impression of 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.659
 that your braid that you have more 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.299
 hair that france has opened knows 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.449
 It got a lot nicer so it's a tip 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.590
 simple but that makes all the difference 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.930
 You open up all the knobby and go 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 do this same process 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 on the other side of your hair 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.989
 Hey 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.080
 now with both sides ready 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.290
 I'll do what I said at the beginning of 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.620
 video that was braid hidden then 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.100
 You take a lock of your hair like that. 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.880
 The way and put it up and we go. 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:36.910
 hide this end of the braid there 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:41.230
 you put the two pieces together so I learned 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.130
 with silicone elastic and then let's 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:48.610
 throw the hair over then tape a 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.440
 Super charming trance is hidden 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.560
 This is a hairstyle that you do. 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.170
 quick and simple at the same time super 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.390
 It's very different because it hid this 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.820
 part of the party I hope you have 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.500
