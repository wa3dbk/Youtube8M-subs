yannis<00:05:33.319> gives<00:05:33.499> you<00:05:33.589> last<00:05:33.740> one<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.039> yes<00:05:34.219> sir<00:05:34.400> but

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:34.999 
yannis gives you last one I yes sir but

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:37.149 
yannis gives you last one I yes sir but
your<00:05:35.599> look<00:05:35.779> it'll<00:05:36.110> be<00:05:36.229> another<00:05:36.680> tricky<00:05:37.009> one<00:05:37.129> I

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
your look it'll be another tricky one I

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.739 
your look it'll be another tricky one I
think<00:05:37.310> it's<00:05:37.729> hard<00:05:38.029> to<00:05:38.149> say<00:05:38.300> what<00:05:38.479> clubs<00:05:38.689> are

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
think it's hard to say what clubs are

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.029 
think it's hard to say what clubs are
