the tablet itself actually doesn't have
that<00:00:33.210> many<00:00:33.420> ports<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.739> there's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> power

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that many ports because there's a power

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.600 
that many ports because there's a power
on<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:36.120> SD<00:00:37.110> card<00:00:37.410> USB<00:00:37.920> me<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.520> if

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
on and off there SD card USB me know if

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.369 
on and off there SD card USB me know if
we<00:00:38.700> keep<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> turning<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> around<00:00:39.480> there's<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we keep on turning it around there's a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.580 
we keep on turning it around there's a
whole<00:00:40.559> bevy<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.920> ports<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> bag<00:00:42.899> let

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
whole bevy of ports there at the bag let

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
whole bevy of ports there at the bag let
me<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.510> spend<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
me just there you go so you can spend a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.279 
me just there you go so you can spend a
little<00:00:45.960> clearer<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.950> USB<00:00:47.370> 3.0<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:49.110> that's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
little clearer to USB 3.0 I think that's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
little clearer to USB 3.0 I think that's
a<00:00:49.410> type-c<00:00:49.920> connector<00:00:50.070> their<00:00:50.579> power<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
a type-c connector their power and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
a type-c connector their power and
ethernet<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> nothing<00:00:55.440> around<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
ethernet so nothing around there now you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.299 
ethernet so nothing around there now you
can<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> side<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.620> tablet<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
can see on this side of the tablet that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
microUSB port there it looks like the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
microUSB port there it looks like the
power<00:01:04.739> button<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:06.140> headphone<00:01:07.140> jack<00:01:07.850> right
