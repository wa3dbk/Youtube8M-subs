00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
actually like going against the guys I
think<00:01:38.670> they<00:01:38.760> give<00:01:38.940> us<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> challenge<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
think they give us a challenge that is a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.320 
think they give us a challenge that is a
little<00:01:40.830> more<00:01:40.920> difficult<00:01:41.130> than<00:01:41.610> girls<00:01:42.090> give

each<00:01:42.480> other<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> biggest

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
each other I think that's the biggest

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.300 
each other I think that's the biggest
