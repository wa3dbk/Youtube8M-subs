00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hi to all today we're going 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.529
 talk about the physical media of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.150
 game cartridges you often know one 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 think they're just constitutes 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
 tenor voice my god this is a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 disaster 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320
 listen I'm a clown from the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 unicellular molecule and 18 years old fat 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.699
 step economy and your brain so 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
 you're exactly like I'm coming from the end 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.039
 of the 1960s and that's what happens 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.230
 there and is just a pretty shabby the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 cold war is wreaking havoc 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.470
 no oh no racism not much worse the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.200
 video games so cruelly from 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 creativity 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.840
 I really need to talk about it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.550
 only from that time the podcasts there that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 does not exist jeans that use to mount the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 headphones carriers to come in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 2014 make my own to castres i was going 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.899
 precisely speaking physical media 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 cartridges so that can not 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 wait three months the hockey people 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.879
 good no but that's a next video 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 so please go here thank you hello to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 all I am edwards clown clown 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.130
 of Edouard and what is happening in the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.100
 video game world 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.040
 absolutely abominable 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.210
 let me tell you my story 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 where I come from we start vaguely 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.200
 heard about the video game that small to 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 little squat novare you have will have a 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.170
 smell of sweat and yet you 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.520
 terminals make us laugh that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 sÃ©verine and in the same way that a good 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.909
 pool party or table football 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.460
 nothing folichon we are far from imagining 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.750
 any future with these things and 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.430
 a morning similar to all the others 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.990
 I enter the bar of my neighborhood for 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.950
 take my glass of morning whiskey 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.360
 until I see it all 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.619
 new form has just been installed a 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.940
 twenty people are lining up 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.830
 to be able to try it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.240
 I'm getting closer and that's where 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.340
 that my laziness and letters that resonates 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.039
 always in our heads 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.179
 space invaders we feel we are that 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.050
 You said maybe not much you 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.369
 makes 2014 but the game turns out absolutely 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.990
 sensational all the diamonds of the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.610
 diet spend the money that's during 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.960
 this machine and go home 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 pretending to their mother that you 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.679
 bakery was closed it's a 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.299
 real fever that seizes all 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.220
 players invaders we have 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.990
 push back some make scores 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.369
 hallucinating others reassures himself as 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.149
 they can by saying that he's playing for 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.039
 participate 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.110
 in short it is undeniable everyone 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.179
 feels no one is challenging it and getting 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.399
 something happening with these new 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.660
 electronic games and necessarily we 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.790
 holds more in place 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 a question is on everyone's lips 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.540
 what do we reserve for them 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.100
 next terminals and so the next 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.600
 games where all this time transpires our 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 underpants of a patient until finally 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
 by another bar to us new terminals 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.880
 we do it 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.260
 some have their opposite rtt another has 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390
 even missed giving birth to his wife 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.970
 for the event here we are all in front 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.110
 the terminal in front of astros the disappointment is 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.959
 reads on all faces 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.250
 what could have happened the game 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.630
 is neither more nor less than a copy 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.130
 exact of seizing of the doors 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.050
 jocelyne then hold back her tears 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.790
 riots is about to break out it's 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010
 normal we must all evacuate this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.660
 disappointment the owner of our 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.670
 dam just time to calm down 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
 to promise us a new terminal 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.430
 of the month on unfortunately 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.400
 The story repeats itself 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.720
 hope then disappointment some 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.040
 invaders we are hitting on like 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.410
 a bunch of fools but honestly 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.239
 it's the same game well others follow 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.100
 always the same thing in starship 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.200
 invaders and it becomes a habit 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.540
 every month a new machine 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.540
 a new disappointment and games 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.069
 follow and look alike 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.049
 a depressed morning man I'm leaning 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.299
 at the bar with my glass of sky and francis 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.219
 just drank 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.409
 this time supporters who told me 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.390
 intrigued ben I'm going to see the terminal 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.340
 indeed francis is all excited for the 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.230
 simple reason that this time we have 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.959
 asteroids and when we shoot at a 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.060
 super effect it divides into two is 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.470
 magnificent 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 finally a few years before we had had 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.920
 an asteroid for which it was the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.440
 principle and at least it does not pay 90% 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.660
 on another game no I'm going up now 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.510
 some totally farting them became 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.800
 crazy was raving in front of galaxie works 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.690
 simply because when we 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.209
 fired or become the missile it looks like 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.769
 what but we know that once at 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.410
 him bernard beuret in the arms of his 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.220
 woman believe me me do not laugh 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.780
 started all more or less the same 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.280
 thing 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.540
 then nintendo also at bercy and we 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.950
 to have they arrived the art of saying 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.300
 look we have a new game 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 totally different 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.080
 he had just replaced the ship by 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.940
 a boat they claimed to give 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.350
 a very original game the pub you 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.100
 say it's not a battle anymore 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.420
 space but nadal or month yet 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.680
 was always bored as much and as if 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.810
 we were when he added a layer 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 with centipede did this time you 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.019
 are in a garden you fight 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.790
 signs that's all cute have watched 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.130
 do not hesitate put some coins 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.350
 whose terminal where you will see 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.460
 right to the demonic creatures the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.990
 pre-programmed movements of 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.700
 extraterrestrials was weird often 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.229
 so it looked like a real 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.979
 choreography was missing more than the small 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:46.080
 music of times it became outright 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.430
 of anything he added plenty of 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.560
 hidden kit monsters the air of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.390
 tell lexar they will be happy but we 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.370
 was furious at sp sin weyders we 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.840
 had filled with hope yet is well 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.520
 more than in front of the machines remained 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.500
 sitting on the wet sidewalk because 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.280
 the games were starting to seriously 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.530
 to annoy us 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.120
 yet on the side of the builders of 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.500
 video games they did not ask there 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.419
 was trying every possible innovation 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.180
 for example pulled down instead of the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.710
 1 yes that's an idea whether it's towards 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.650
 the up down whatever it is in the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.850
 depth but all of this finally 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.770
 it was not much 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.580
 shortly after and the coup de grace 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.110
 to edward ah yes the coup de grace I 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.850
 can not wait to find out more the tension is at 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.020
 his height I had vaguely heard 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.690
 talk about a japanese game 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.150
 donkey kong well third opus is 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.950
 arrived in our room we went 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.300
 hurried on the terminal you want to see 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.120
 the monkey and the one that everyone 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.550
 called japan and piwi we had punished him 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.289
 during what if you have everything 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.120
 simply repel the bees from the 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.610
 gorilla what had happened 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.370
 it was for me the moment of too much 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.659
 could no longer I had to express it I 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.430
 so ran to fetch up the 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.560
 wearing headphones audio and here I am for 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.570
 express my hatred towards the video game 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.310
 to attacks no I leave more there 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.050
 has a gain necessarily had to go out 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.140
 special value codes its customers 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.040
 did indeed have to play on the 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.210
 perspective for 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.340
 destroy boas bouncing 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.660
 I admit that and we laughed even if we 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.370
 stayed close to everything we had seen 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.650
 he had a little idea that was doing the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.530
 difference banter and who exploited it 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.760
 very well but honestly it's the only one 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.440
 oh yeah no bowl of the coup I'll see 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640
 your 2014 games I'm sure you 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.200
 have some awesome stuff shattered when I 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.860
 arrived late, keeps the camera 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.320
 was magnificent 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.280
 the ds then that's really three times 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.960
 nothing a little bit if you want to try 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.010
 but yeah I'm a little thing like 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.140
 it 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.900
 wow this is beautiful what is 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.670
 it's me it's just where you should 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.240
 maybe make me the chief I do not think 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.070
 that you will like 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.570
 it's a modernized version of space 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.570
 invaders what I wanted to try
