 Camera with cowbell crumbs the camera 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.070
 consists of a base unit and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.300
 a camera head it is the

 possibility of a second head 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 connect for two channel or fixe 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.899
 synchronous 3d shots 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 the camera has one 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.340
 dynamic range of 13 dazzle and gives 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 over 1 42 mbit signal up to 60 pictures 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 Professor currently there are the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 possibility of the camera about the company 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.690
 and or room and with objective too 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.820
 equip 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.859
 over the basis unit all

 can also be stored in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.550
 various user programs the signal 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140
 is output in hd sdi and thus can 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.180
 directly to an external recorder 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 be connected with the use of 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.770
 two camera heads for the 3d operation 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 only one base unit is required 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 both cameras are connected and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.580
 are processed in a process that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 just both units absolutely change 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 synchronously output a signal 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.790
 it is possible a connection 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.430
 Produce up to 180 meters across 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.840
 a short cable is otherwise over 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.189
 this course plus cable also the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 power supply to the channel heads 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.780
 manufactured 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 The power supply of the camera is over

 be a driver or over a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.420
 external power supply 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.400
 Here we are this act as 3d construction 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.280
 with room and lenses the camera 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.830
 is used as a variant for 3d or 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 Can also be used over a mirror away 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.750
 become 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.610
 the camera is currently in the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.810
 series production and will end 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 be available in november 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.880
 the price for the one channel version 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.270
 speaking with a camera head costs 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.250
 about 17,000 euros and as a 3d variant 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 or 2 channel version with two heads 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 and the base unit will be the price
