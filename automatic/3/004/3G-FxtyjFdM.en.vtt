00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.720 
fast where the Barney's exclusive one
would<00:00:52.620> assume<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.520> only<00:00:53.579> get

another<00:02:55.050> ballpark<00:02:55.260> formulated<00:02:56.160> too<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.580> so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
another ballpark formulated too but so

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.480 
another ballpark formulated too but so
anyway<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> first<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.990> is<00:02:58.080> Vanessa<00:02:58.490> that's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
anyway the first one is Vanessa that's

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.600 
anyway the first one is Vanessa that's
on<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.760> lips<00:02:59.940> right<00:03:00.000> now<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.160> described

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
see when I first started eating videos

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.650 
see when I first started eating videos
but<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.890> realized<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.430> when<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.240> do<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.480> on

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
but then I realized that when I do it on

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.010 
but then I realized that when I do it on
camera

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
camera

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.240 
camera
people<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.410> see<00:04:39.560> first<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.890> all<00:04:39.980> how<00:04:40.160> it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
people can see first of all how it

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.160 
people can see first of all how it
applies<00:04:40.490> how<00:04:40.970> easy<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.600> apply<00:04:41.660> how

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
applies how easy it is to apply how

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.170 
applies how easy it is to apply how
great<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.800> coverage<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.550> then<00:04:43.910> how

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
great the coverage is and then how

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.900 
great the coverage is and then how
opaque<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:44.900> whether<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.380> shows<00:04:45.590> up

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
opaque it is whether it shows up

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.340 
opaque it is whether it shows up
differently<00:04:46.910> because<00:04:47.660> my<00:04:47.900> lips<00:04:48.080> or<00:04:48.320> a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
differently because my lips or a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
reasonably pigmented or not and this one

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.380 
reasonably pigmented or not and this one
was<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.840> first<00:04:50.930> one<00:04:51.260> Vanessa<00:04:52.240> could<00:04:53.240> see

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
was the first one Vanessa could see

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.330 
was the first one Vanessa could see
they're<00:04:53.540> super<00:04:53.990> different<00:04:54.170> but<00:04:55.130> they<00:04:55.220> both

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
they're super different but they both

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.220 
they're super different but they both
have<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.550> slight<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.090> purple<00:04:56.510> one<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.200> a

have a slight little purple one is a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.480 
have a slight little purple one is a
slightly<00:04:57.560> low<00:04:57.740> purple<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.100> one<00:04:58.160> has<00:04:58.340> more
