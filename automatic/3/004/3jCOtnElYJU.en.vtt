00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 And then personal beauty, my name is Natalie. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.379
 this is the step that played a program of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.919
 cooking for those who like to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.410
 pasta 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.410
 in today's poet's episode in the background 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.930
 You know that special dinner that 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.020
 Do you want to make your boyfriend for your 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.760
 girlfriend on a colder day with that 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.070
 romantic climate 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.670
 then the polenta is the ideal dish is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.790
 delicious super easy to do fast and 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.140
 accompanied by 20 then in certainty of 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.989
 Your boyfriend will love it. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.750
 You're absolutely not going to make cheese. 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.180
 so let's get the ingredients to make the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.970
 polenta you will need flour from 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.600
 pre-cooked beef broth 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.089
 cream for the same grated 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.940
 butter salt and black pepper to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.200
 season the mushrooms you will need 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 of mushroom paris the Shiite government haq 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.690
 garlic olive oil beef broth 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.570
 parsley 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.549
 I'll start while the mushrooms 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.580
 how it should not be washed because it 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.080
 absorbs the water like a sponge and then 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 time that you cut the consistency 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.450
 will not okay and flavor decreases 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.000
 also then when you buy a 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.369
 mushroom looking for a good provenance 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.219
 that he has a legal appearance and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.250
 do not be too dirty then clean 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.820
 I'll get a damp cloth and I'll go 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.640
 around the mushroom remove earth and 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.990
 excess dirt because the burned 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.990
 runs in truth 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.950
 now I'm going to throw the mushrooms 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.700
 paris mushroom does not need to take the car 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.920
 So I'm going to share empathy. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.319
 have very thick nor is workshop 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 so we can feel the consistency of the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.980
 mushroom 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:20.310
 the shitake mushroom will clear the way and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.590
 do not miss the same thing in slices or 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.380
 too thick or too thin for people 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.129
 feel the taste and texture of the game 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.769
 melo so the sautÃ©ed mushrooms 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.930
 I'm going to revoke them so I'm going to stay 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.569
 al clove of garlic that I browned garlic 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.440
 in the pan with a string of olive oil and then I 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.440
 games like melo 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.140
 and look, it's golden now I'm going to add 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140
 the mushrooms 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.910
 I will also add 50 ml of 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.910
 beef 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.180
 now I'm going to add it also looks chem only 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.940
 take out the sheets and put in here 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.610
 of a special perfume a special flavor 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.290
 Look who combines a lot with the mushrooms. 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.960
 it's a delight 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.510
 I'll let the mushroom broth reduce 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.650
 meanwhile I will prepare the polenta will 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.030
 leave on low heat with the pan 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.770
 capped and at the end of a certain day salt 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.270
 I'll add the stock to start with. 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.610
 seasoned with a little pepper 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.800
 kingdom and salt and add the cream 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.890
 in this broth to stir the voice was 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.940
 because it's better not to 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.890
 to embark 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.570
 but if you do not have it you can use a 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.270
 reap now also my case has boiled 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.060
 so I'll add the flour 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.830
 maize gradually and I'm always stirring 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.900
 I'm using pre-cooked because it's more 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.910
 fast five minutes is ready 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.540

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.490
 problem 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.470
 You can use the cornmeal only there you have it. 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.040
