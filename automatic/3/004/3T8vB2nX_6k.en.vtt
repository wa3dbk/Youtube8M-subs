00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
first off think good things about this

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.590 
first off think good things about this
not<00:01:25.340> sure<00:01:25.609> is<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:25.969> um<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:27.380> got<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.590> little

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
not sure is that um it's got a little

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.289 
not sure is that um it's got a little
thing<00:01:29.600> here<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.990> show<00:01:30.200> us<00:01:30.319> 0<00:01:30.890> degrees<00:01:31.130> 5<00:01:31.460> 10<00:01:31.819> 15

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
thing here it show us 0 degrees 5 10 15

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.739 
thing here it show us 0 degrees 5 10 15
20<00:01:32.329> goes<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.109> to<00:01:33.229> 5<00:01:33.520> goes<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.670> every<00:01:34.850> 5<00:01:35.329> all<00:01:35.719> the

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
20 goes up to 5 goes up every 5 all the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.929 
20 goes up to 5 goes up every 5 all the
way<00:01:35.899> up<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.170> 60<00:01:38.619> seems<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.770> be<00:01:39.859> spot-on<00:01:40.159> we're

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
way up to 60 seems to be spot-on we're

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.270 
way up to 60 seems to be spot-on we're
pretty<00:01:41.179> close<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.889> tell<00:01:43.100> where

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
pretty close to it you can tell where

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.770 
pretty close to it you can tell where
you<00:01:43.369> are<00:01:43.399> by<00:01:43.759> there's<00:01:43.999> a<00:01:44.060> flat<00:01:44.299> piece<00:01:44.509> right

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
you are by there's a flat piece right

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.209 
you are by there's a flat piece right
here<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.049> goes<00:01:45.350> up<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:45.950> there's<00:01:46.130> a

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
here that goes up but then there's a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.029 
here that goes up but then there's a
little<00:01:46.340> right<00:01:47.030> angle<00:01:47.179> right<00:01:47.509> here<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:48.799> piece

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
little right angle right here this piece

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.379 
little right angle right here this piece
that<00:01:49.249> goes<00:01:49.399> up<00:01:49.579> shows<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.030> what<00:01:50.240> degree

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
that goes up shows you what degree

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.160 
that goes up shows you what degree
you're<00:01:50.719> at<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.499> very<00:01:51.649> nice<00:01:53.109> holds<00:01:54.109> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
you're at so it's very nice holds the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.160 
you're at so it's very nice holds the
tubing<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.679> tight<00:01:54.920> with<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:57.229> piece<00:01:57.770> here<00:01:59.170> so

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
tubing in tight with this piece here so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.959 
tubing in tight with this piece here so
one<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.679> only<00:02:00.799> issues<00:02:01.219> with<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
one of the only issues with this is that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.870 
one of the only issues with this is that
um<00:02:02.350> between<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.799> actual<00:02:04.219> notching<00:02:04.670> piece

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
um between this actual notching piece

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.370 
um between this actual notching piece
and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.359> base<00:02:05.509> plate<00:02:05.810> that's<00:02:06.079> actually

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and the base plate that's actually

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.919 
and the base plate that's actually
attached<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:07.060> when<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.479> put<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.840> in

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
attached to when you just put it in

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.110 
attached to when you just put it in
there<00:02:09.020> put<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> tube<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.560> there<00:02:09.740> your<00:02:10.640> tubing

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
there put a tube in there your tubing

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.450 
there put a tube in there your tubing
comes<00:02:11.569> out<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.290> piece<00:02:12.950> around

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
comes out a piece around

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.980 
comes out a piece around

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.040 
here is it comes out like this you can
see<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.530> about<00:02:18.650> half<00:02:19.690> right<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.960> half

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
see that it's about half right and half

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.770 
see that it's about half right and half
wrong<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.380> did<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.740> fix<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.780> you

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
wrong so what we did to fix that is you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.450 
wrong so what we did to fix that is you
take<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.960> couple<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.320> washers<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:28.040> washer

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
take a couple of washers like one washer

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.860 
take a couple of washers like one washer
under<00:02:28.730> each<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.090> these<00:02:29.180> there's<00:02:29.420> three<00:02:29.570> bolts

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
under each of these there's three bolts

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.530 
under each of these there's three bolts
here<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.260> need<00:02:30.950> some<00:02:31.100> spot<00:02:32.000> there's<00:02:32.270> one<00:02:32.390> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
here I need some spot there's one that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.910 
here I need some spot there's one that
kind<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.720> holds<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.140> pivoting<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
kind of holds for the pivoting and to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.400 
kind of holds for the pivoting and to
that<00:02:34.130> hold<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.490> place<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.000> what<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.020> do<00:02:36.260> is

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
that hold it in place so what you do is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.880 
that hold it in place so what you do is
put<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.860> washer<00:02:37.250> under<00:02:37.760> each<00:02:37.940> one<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:39.470> some<00:02:39.650> test

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
put a washer under each one do some test

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.350 
put a washer under each one do some test
rods<00:02:40.130> figure<00:02:40.490> out<00:02:40.550> exactly<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:41.000> yours<00:02:41.180> need

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
rods figure out exactly what yours need

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120 
rods figure out exactly what yours need
to<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.870> case<00:02:42.050> they<00:02:42.290> mess<00:02:42.770> up<00:02:42.950> and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
to be just in case they mess up and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.280 
to be just in case they mess up and
everyone's<00:02:43.520> different<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.960> did<00:02:45.110> one

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
everyone's different but I just did one

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.340 
everyone's different but I just did one
washer<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.220> once<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.460> do<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:47.350> it'll

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
washer and then once you do that it'll

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.740 
washer and then once you do that it'll
start<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.830> come<00:02:49.100> out<00:02:49.130> proper<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.240> even<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.690> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
start to come out proper and even as you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.050 
start to come out proper and even as you
can<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.050> in<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.320> one<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.370> once<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:55.910> get<00:02:55.970> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
can see in this one so once you get the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.790 
can see in this one so once you get the
washes<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.570> next<00:02:57.020> thing<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.230> want<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.440> do<00:02:57.590> is

have a five sixteen twenty-four thread

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.350 
have a five sixteen twenty-four thread
tap<00:03:02.660> around<00:03:03.580> reason<00:03:04.580> for<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.240> because

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
tap around reason for this is because

I've used this for a number of roll

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.740 
I've used this for a number of roll
cages<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.040> starting<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.460> wear<00:03:25.640> out<00:03:25.820> as

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
cages so it's starting to wear out as

you can see in this bottom one it's got
a<00:03:28.070> totally<00:03:28.490> different<00:03:28.520> bolt<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.680> it's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
a totally different bolt on it it's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.800 
a totally different bolt on it it's
actually<00:03:30.890> got<00:03:31.010> an<00:03:31.070> Allen<00:03:31.430> I'm<00:03:32.180> not<00:03:32.390> an<00:03:32.480> Allen

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
actually got an Allen I'm not an Allen

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.480 
actually got an Allen I'm not an Allen
uh<00:03:33.820> it's<00:03:34.820> actually<00:03:34.970> got<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:36.770> can't<00:03:37.310> remember

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
it so I can hand tighten it with that I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.980 
it so I can hand tighten it with that I
haven't<00:03:39.200> have<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.410> wrench<00:03:40.310> each<00:03:40.520> time<00:03:40.990> helps

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
haven't have a wrench each time helps

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.780 
haven't have a wrench each time helps
out<00:03:42.170> makes<00:03:42.440> things<00:03:42.650> easier<00:03:43.070> all<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.460> have<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.700> do

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
out makes things easier all I have to do

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.630 
out makes things easier all I have to do
is<00:03:43.880> just<00:03:43.970> get<00:03:44.120> tight<00:03:44.300> enough<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.690> hold<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:45.020> in

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
is just get tight enough to hold it in

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.400 
is just get tight enough to hold it in
so<00:03:47.800> with<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:48.980> being<00:03:49.190> said<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.050> goes<00:03:51.200> up<00:03:51.230> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
so with that being said so it goes up to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.430 
so with that being said so it goes up to
sixty<00:03:51.770> degrees<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:53.300> only<00:03:53.630> issue<00:03:53.840> with<00:03:54.290> that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
sixty degrees the only issue with that

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.010 
sixty degrees the only issue with that
is<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.340> put<00:03:55.520> on<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> table<00:03:55.910> like<00:03:56.210> this<00:03:56.270> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
is that you put on a table like this you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.660 
is that you put on a table like this you
won't<00:03:57.200> be<00:03:57.320> able<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.530> hit<00:03:57.770> sixty<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.490> hit

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
won't be able to hit sixty I can hit

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.140 
won't be able to hit sixty I can hit
about<00:03:58.850> forty<00:03:59.630> eight<00:03:59.660> fifty<00:04:00.820> before<00:04:01.820> it<00:04:01.940> starts

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
about forty eight fifty before it starts

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.240 
about forty eight fifty before it starts
hitting<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.510> table<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:03.470> what<00:04:03.620> they<00:04:03.740> do<00:04:03.800> here

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
hitting the table so what they do here

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.960 
hitting the table so what they do here
is<00:04:04.460> on<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.030> backside<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.890> there's<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.070> you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
is on the backside of it there's a you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.930 
is on the backside of it there's a you
can<00:04:08.120> pivot<00:04:08.300> this<00:04:08.480> whole<00:04:08.780> thing<00:04:09.080> sideways<00:04:09.940> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
can pivot this whole thing sideways so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.250 
can pivot this whole thing sideways so
what<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> lot<00:04:11.240> of<00:04:11.270> people<00:04:11.570> do<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.870> they<00:04:11.990> put<00:04:12.170> this

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
what a lot of people do is they put this

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.680 
what a lot of people do is they put this
base<00:04:12.500> plate<00:04:12.530> on<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.490> post<00:04:13.910> on<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> ground<00:04:14.420> and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
base plate on a post on the ground and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
base plate on a post on the ground and
then<00:04:15.200> they<00:04:15.290> turn<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.590> sideways<00:04:15.770> so<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.190> poles

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
then they turn it sideways so the poles

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.610 
then they turn it sideways so the poles
running<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.299> way<00:04:17.540> when<00:04:18.109> they're<00:04:18.230> cutting<00:04:18.500> it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
running this way when they're cutting it

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.260 
running this way when they're cutting it
as<00:04:18.770> opposed<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.190> like<00:04:19.400> down<00:04:19.609> at<00:04:19.880> an<00:04:19.970> angle<00:04:20.210> or

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
as opposed to like down at an angle or

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.620 
as opposed to like down at an angle or
something<00:04:20.420> like<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.780> which<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.650> very<00:04:21.919> nice

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
something like that which is very nice

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.610 
something like that which is very nice
next<00:04:23.630> thing<00:04:23.780> is

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
next thing is

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.090 
next thing is
your<00:04:25.720> actual<00:04:26.720> drill<00:04:27.020> bit<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.590> held<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:27.889> by<00:04:28.040> this

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
your actual drill bit is held on by this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.480 
your actual drill bit is held on by this
piece<00:04:28.720> which<00:04:29.720> has<00:04:29.900> two<00:04:30.169> again<00:04:30.590> two<00:04:30.830> more<00:04:31.070> bolts

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
piece which has two again two more bolts

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.700 
piece which has two again two more bolts
which<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.570> have<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.870> reach<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.199> from<00:04:33.440> time<00:04:33.620> to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
which you have to reach a from time to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.390 
which you have to reach a from time to
time<00:04:33.770> because<00:04:34.100> they<00:04:34.220> do<00:04:34.340> go<00:04:34.490> bad<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.190> first

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
time because they do go bad so the first

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.460 
time because they do go bad so the first
thing<00:04:37.520> about<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.820> what<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.060> need<00:04:38.470> other

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
thing about this what you need other

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.629 
thing about this what you need other
than<00:04:40.130> your<00:04:40.220> cap<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.750> 13<00:04:42.380> millimeter<00:04:42.710> that's

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
than your cap is a 13 millimeter that's

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.980 
than your cap is a 13 millimeter that's
what<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.850> size<00:04:44.030> bolts<00:04:44.449> that<00:04:44.510> come<00:04:44.660> with<00:04:44.840> this

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
what the size bolts that come with this

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.420 
what the size bolts that come with this
is<00:04:45.139> unless<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.530> upgrade<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.979> different<00:04:46.280> ones

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
is unless you upgrade to different ones

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.320 
is unless you upgrade to different ones
and<00:04:46.639> then<00:04:46.760> be<00:04:46.880> different<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:48.100> wd-40<00:04:49.270> wd-40<00:04:50.270> is

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
and then be different and wd-40 wd-40 is

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330 
and then be different and wd-40 wd-40 is
extremely<00:04:50.900> crucial<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.440> this<00:04:51.560> because<00:04:52.010> when

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
extremely crucial to this because when

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.310 
extremely crucial to this because when
you're<00:04:52.460> drilling<00:04:52.699> this<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.540> just<00:04:53.810> metal<00:04:54.139> on

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
you're drilling this is just metal on

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320 
you're drilling this is just metal on
metal<00:04:54.350> in<00:04:54.800> here<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.699> want<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.940> keep<00:04:56.120> this

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
metal in here you want to keep this

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.050 
metal in here you want to keep this
lubed<00:04:56.750> up<00:04:56.960> if<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.500> goes<00:04:57.710> bad<00:04:58.010> because<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.850> heat

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
lubed up if it goes bad because the heat

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.050 
lubed up if it goes bad because the heat
will<00:04:59.240> cause<00:04:59.419> it<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.630> just<00:05:00.310> wear<00:05:01.310> out<00:05:01.490> faster

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
will cause it to just wear out faster

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.240 
will cause it to just wear out faster
and<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:03.080> want<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.289> make<00:05:03.440> sure<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.740> stays<00:05:04.010> as

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and you want to make sure it stays as

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.740 
and you want to make sure it stays as
smooth<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.789> there<00:05:04.970> as<00:05:05.120> possible<00:05:05.330> while

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
smooth and there as possible while

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.680 
smooth and there as possible while
you're<00:05:05.870> doing<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.370> it's<00:05:07.370> only<00:05:07.580> fifty<00:05:07.970> dollars

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
you're doing it it's only fifty dollars

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
true if it breaks just get another one

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.250 
true if it breaks just get another one
but<00:05:10.639> why<00:05:11.240> spend<00:05:11.600> more<00:05:11.750> money<00:05:11.900> we<00:05:12.110> can<00:05:12.199> make

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
but why spend more money we can make

but why spend more money we can make
this<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.680> work<00:05:12.710> um<00:05:13.690> also<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:16.039> don't<00:05:16.220> have

this one work um also if you don't have

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.820 
this one work um also if you don't have
like<00:05:16.580> cutting<00:05:16.940> oil<00:05:17.030> use<00:05:17.750> wd-40<00:05:18.410> it'll<00:05:18.680> help

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
like cutting oil use wd-40 it'll help

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.870 
like cutting oil use wd-40 it'll help
when<00:05:18.979> you're<00:05:19.100> cutting<00:05:19.220> because<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.610> keeps<00:05:19.699> it

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
when you're cutting because it keeps it

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.129 
when you're cutting because it keeps it
cool<00:05:21.100> don't<00:05:22.100> go<00:05:22.190> through<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:22.460> as<00:05:22.580> many<00:05:22.760> bits

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
cool don't go through so as many bits

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.060 
cool don't go through so as many bits
now<00:05:24.139> when<00:05:24.260> you're<00:05:24.380> doing<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:24.620> you're

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
now when you're doing this you're

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.240 
now when you're doing this you're
cutting<00:05:25.310> metal<00:05:25.580> let<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.150> drill<00:05:26.419> do<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.810> work

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
cutting metal let the drill do the work

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.760 
cutting metal let the drill do the work
sit<00:05:28.250> there<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.580> heist<00:05:29.500> medium<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.620> high

sit there at a heist medium to high
speed<00:05:32.830> don't<00:05:33.830> press<00:05:34.130> down<00:05:34.160> too<00:05:34.669> hard

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
speed don't press down too hard

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.820 
speed don't press down too hard
obviously<00:05:35.690> give<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.229> pressure<00:05:36.470> you're<00:05:36.800> going

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
obviously give it pressure you're going

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.930 
obviously give it pressure you're going
to<00:05:36.979> have<00:05:37.099> to<00:05:37.250> otherwise<00:05:37.520> it's<00:05:37.669> just<00:05:37.789> going<00:05:37.880> to

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
to have to otherwise it's just going to

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.670 
to have to otherwise it's just going to
sit<00:05:38.090> there<00:05:38.120> spinning<00:05:38.479> on<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.660> metal<00:05:38.960> but<00:05:39.620> you

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
sit there spinning on the metal but you

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.810 
sit there spinning on the metal but you
don't<00:05:39.830> want<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.039> push<00:05:40.190> down<00:05:40.400> with<00:05:40.460> all<00:05:40.789> your

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
don't want to push down with all your

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.120 
don't want to push down with all your
weight<00:05:41.349> otherwise<00:05:42.349> you'll<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.680> be<00:05:42.860> going

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
weight otherwise you'll just be going

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.350 
weight otherwise you'll just be going
through<00:05:43.250> tip<00:05:43.520> your<00:05:43.760> bits<00:05:44.000> like<00:05:44.599> crazy<00:05:45.200> um<00:05:46.360> so

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
through tip your bits like crazy um so

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.839 
through tip your bits like crazy um so
for<00:05:47.570> this<00:05:47.750> what<00:05:47.930> I<00:05:47.960> did<00:05:48.200> was<00:05:48.460> 1.75<00:05:49.460> outer

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
for this what I did was 1.75 outer

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.680 
for this what I did was 1.75 outer
diameter<00:05:50.389> with<00:05:51.200> an<00:05:51.289> eighth<00:05:51.410> inch<00:05:51.440> wall<00:05:51.919> and

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
diameter with an eighth inch wall and

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.969 
diameter with an eighth inch wall and
1.5<00:05:53.690> inch<00:05:53.960> inner<00:05:54.169> diameter<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:54.800> cooked

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
1.5 inch inner diameter and it cooked

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.159 
1.5 inch inner diameter and it cooked
great<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.539> haven't<00:05:56.539> cut<00:05:56.660> any<00:05:56.810> thicker<00:05:57.020> than

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
great I haven't cut any thicker than

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.540 
great I haven't cut any thicker than
that<00:05:57.320> I<00:05:57.349> couldn't<00:05:57.680> tell<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:57.949> for<00:05:57.979> sure<00:05:58.130> I

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
that I couldn't tell you for sure I

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.040 
that I couldn't tell you for sure I
don't<00:05:58.729> know<00:05:58.970> exactly<00:05:59.120> how<00:05:59.630> we<00:05:59.690> would<00:05:59.870> do

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
don't know exactly how we would do

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.210 
don't know exactly how we would do
smaller<00:06:00.949> would<00:06:01.220> be<00:06:01.370> easier<00:06:01.910> obviously<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.860> for

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
smaller would be easier obviously so for

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.180 
smaller would be easier obviously so for
this<00:06:04.900> you're<00:06:05.900> going<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.260> cut<00:06:06.530> I<00:06:06.560> have<00:06:06.680> it<00:06:06.919> set

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
this you're going to cut I have it set

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.290 
this you're going to cut I have it set
at<00:06:08.050> 15<00:06:09.050> degrees<00:06:09.410> right<00:06:09.440> now<00:06:10.120> we're<00:06:11.120> going<00:06:11.240> to

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
at 15 degrees right now we're going to

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.300 
at 15 degrees right now we're going to
cut<00:06:11.510> this<00:06:11.660> piece<00:06:11.900> here<00:06:12.289> imagine<00:06:13.099> that<00:06:13.190> this

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
cut this piece here imagine that this

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.950 
cut this piece here imagine that this
was<00:06:13.490> steel<00:06:13.729> tubing<00:06:14.120> I<00:06:14.300> just<00:06:14.510> don't<00:06:14.690> want<00:06:14.870> to

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
was steel tubing I just don't want to

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.600 
was steel tubing I just don't want to
clean<00:06:15.860> up<00:06:15.949> all<00:06:16.099> the<00:06:16.190> metal<00:06:16.400> shavings

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
clean up all the metal shavings

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.300 
clean up all the metal shavings
afterwards<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:18.440> put<00:06:18.470> it<00:06:18.770> in<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.979> where<00:06:19.160> it'll

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
afterwards you put it in to where it'll

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.210 
afterwards you put it in to where it'll
go<00:06:20.650> tighten<00:06:21.650> this<00:06:21.800> down<00:06:23.260> super<00:06:24.260> easy<00:06:24.380> squeeze

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
go tighten this down super easy squeeze

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.040 
go tighten this down super easy squeeze
it<00:06:25.400> into<00:06:25.580> a<00:06:25.760> little<00:06:25.940> triangle<00:06:26.479> piece<00:06:26.660> here<00:06:26.930> on

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
it into a little triangle piece here on

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:37.320 
it into a little triangle piece here on
both<00:06:27.229> sides<00:06:27.260> so<00:06:27.680> it<00:06:27.770> holds<00:06:27.979> it<00:06:28.130> in<00:06:28.250> nice

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.220 

now<00:06:38.330> if<00:06:38.450> that<00:06:38.480> were<00:06:38.660> metal<00:06:38.840> it<00:06:39.050> would<00:06:39.140> have

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
now if that were metal it would have

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.540 
now if that were metal it would have
taken<00:06:39.500> about<00:06:39.620> 45<00:06:40.520> seconds<00:06:40.910> to<00:06:40.970> do<00:06:44.950> but<00:06:45.950> because

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
taken about 45 seconds to do but because

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
taken about 45 seconds to do but because
it's<00:06:46.880> nice<00:06:47.030> little<00:06:47.360> easy<00:06:47.480> cardboard<00:06:49.570> point

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
it's nice little easy cardboard point

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.030 
it's nice little easy cardboard point
batting<00:06:50.870> about<00:06:50.930> cardboard<00:06:51.380> is<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:51.620> looks<00:06:51.860> like

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
batting about cardboard is it looks like

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.340 
batting about cardboard is it looks like
crap<00:06:52.340> after<00:06:52.520> you<00:06:52.730> cut<00:06:52.880> it<00:06:53.000> but<00:06:53.600> so<00:06:54.140> what<00:06:54.260> we

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
crap after you cut it but so what we

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.190 
crap after you cut it but so what we
just<00:06:54.470> did<00:06:54.680> here<00:06:55.150> it'll<00:06:56.150> make<00:06:56.390> it<00:06:56.510> fit<00:06:56.750> on<00:06:56.780> here

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
just did here it'll make it fit on here

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.440 
just did here it'll make it fit on here
at<00:06:57.380> a<00:06:57.590> 15<00:06:57.980> degree<00:06:58.100> angle<00:06:58.310> as<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:58.700> can<00:06:58.940> see<00:06:59.180> here

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
at a 15 degree angle as you can see here

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.860 
at a 15 degree angle as you can see here
fits<00:07:00.140> nicely<00:07:00.380> all<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:00.830> way<00:07:00.950> around<00:07:01.780> and<00:07:02.780> if

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
fits nicely all the way around and if

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.060 
fits nicely all the way around and if
that<00:07:02.960> were<00:07:03.080> my<00:07:03.200> cage<00:07:03.410> I<00:07:03.560> could<00:07:03.680> just<00:07:03.800> weld<00:07:03.950> that

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
that were my cage I could just weld that

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.550 
that were my cage I could just weld that
up<00:07:04.280> clean<00:07:04.640> it<00:07:04.670> off<00:07:04.930> the<00:07:05.930> grinder<00:07:06.350> or<00:07:06.530> a

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
up clean it off the grinder or a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.300 
up clean it off the grinder or a
grinding<00:07:07.190> wheel<00:07:07.250> and<00:07:08.770> then<00:07:09.770> weld<00:07:09.980> that<00:07:10.100> right

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
grinding wheel and then weld that right

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.120 
grinding wheel and then weld that right
on<00:07:10.870> so<00:07:12.490> $50<00:07:13.490> this<00:07:13.670> is<00:07:13.730> great<00:07:14.030> I've<00:07:14.240> used<00:07:14.540> it<00:07:14.660> on

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
on so $50 this is great I've used it on

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.940 
on so $50 this is great I've used it on
to<00:07:16.130> four<00:07:16.400> roll<00:07:16.610> cages<00:07:16.850> so<00:07:17.180> far<00:07:17.650> and<00:07:18.650> it's<00:07:18.770> done

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950

believe<00:07:26.210> that's<00:07:26.420> it<00:07:26.630> it's<00:07:26.810> it's<00:07:27.080> definitely

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
believe that's it it's it's definitely

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
believe that's it it's it's definitely
worth<00:07:28.220> the<00:07:28.250> money

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760 
worth the money

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
obviously it's nothing like a

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.610 
obviously it's nothing like a
professional<00:07:30.770> one<00:07:31.310> but<00:07:32.210> for<00:07:32.540> us<00:07:32.750> average

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
