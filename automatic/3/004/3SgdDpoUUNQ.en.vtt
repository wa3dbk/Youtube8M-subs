does not want to go in a pail there we
go<00:00:36.690> save<00:00:37.050> those<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.410> another<00:00:37.649> random<00:00:37.860> pack

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
go save those for another random pack

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
go save those for another random pack
opening<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.180> through

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
opening and let's see we got through

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450 
opening and let's see we got through
this<00:00:39.600> random<00:00:40.170> pack<00:00:40.320> opening<00:00:40.710> photon

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

Genesis<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:46.079> say<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> said<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.620> completely

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
Genesis let's say I said that completely

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
Genesis let's say I said that completely
wrong<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.629> another<00:00:48.629> fan<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> darkness

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
wrong and another fan of darkness

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.540 
wrong and another fan of darkness
hopefully<00:00:49.890> I'll<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
hopefully I'll get some good from that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.860 
hopefully I'll get some good from that
get<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> bail<00:00:51.090> card<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.629> went<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
get that you bail card like we went to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
get that you bail card like we went to
last<00:00:51.960> time<00:00:52.110> right<00:00:52.320> let's<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.370> photon

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
last time right let's see photon

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
last time right let's see photon
shockwave<00:00:53.730> first<00:00:54.420> again<00:00:55.020> no<00:00:55.199> particular

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
shockwave first again no particular

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
shockwave first again no particular
order<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:57.140> go<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.170> it<00:01:01.010> alright

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
order I just kind of go with it alright

order I just kind of go with it alright
let's<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.640> hopefully<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.629> with

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809

let's see hopefully we will do well with
these<00:01:03.930> random<00:01:04.229> facts<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.799> seem<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.700> day

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
these random facts and seem that one day

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
these random facts and seem that one day
a<00:01:05.820> piece<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.270> pretty<00:01:06.510> good<00:01:06.630> gishki<00:01:07.049> beast

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a piece that's pretty good gishki beast

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
a piece that's pretty good gishki beast
and<00:01:07.799> black<00:01:08.520> ray<00:01:08.729> Lancer<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.270> already<00:01:09.450> got<00:01:09.570> one

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and black ray Lancer we already got one

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
and black ray Lancer we already got one
of<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.869> actually<00:01:10.200> program<00:01:10.470> faculty<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.010> far

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of these actually program faculty so far

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
of these actually program faculty so far
again<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.450> looks<00:01:12.600> awesome

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I hope maybe in the future I can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.260 
I hope maybe in the future I can
actually<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> card<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> something

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
actually use this card in something

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.770 
actually use this card in something
let's<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.930> duelist<00:01:22.439> genesis

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
let's see we have duelist genesis

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
let's see we have duelist genesis
Stardust<00:01:24.780> Dragon<00:01:24.840> please<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.159> why

ghost one see what do we have we have a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
ghost one see what do we have we have a
graceful<00:01:34.439> revival<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.100> awe<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:36.270> today<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
graceful revival and awe not today I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.319 
graceful revival and awe not today I
guess<00:01:37.020> right<00:01:37.259> oh<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> these<00:01:38.759> days<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
guess right oh well one of these days it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
guess right oh well one of these days it
will<00:01:39.420> happen<00:01:39.799> right<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.009> photon

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
will happen right we have photon

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:51.249 
will happen right we have photon
shockwave<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:48.320> right<00:01:49.320> photon<00:01:50.070> lead

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
shockwave there we go right photon lead

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.030 
shockwave there we go right photon lead
so<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> either<00:01:52.680> sora<00:01:52.979> diplo<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.920> our

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so we have either sora diplo for our

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.130 
so we have either sora diplo for our
rare<00:01:57.020> power<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> duelist

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.340 

now<00:02:02.830> maybe<00:02:03.100> we'll<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.490> our<00:02:03.729> hollow<00:02:04.330> Neos<00:02:04.990> card

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
now maybe we'll get our hollow Neos card

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.240 
now maybe we'll get our hollow Neos card
I<00:02:05.560> don't<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:05.890> got<00:02:06.040> one<00:02:06.250> yet<00:02:08.100> all<00:02:09.100> right

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I don't think we got one yet all right

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.630 
I don't think we got one yet all right
we<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> super<00:02:10.330> vehicroid<00:02:10.509> jumbo<00:02:10.869> drill

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
we have a super vehicroid jumbo drill

second I thought maybe that was like a

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.490 
second I thought maybe that was like a
neo<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.360> like<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.480> fusion<00:04:21.930> or<00:04:22.020> something<00:04:22.380> that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
neo so like a fusion or something that

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.440 
neo so like a fusion or something that
was<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.680> holographic<00:04:23.370> still<00:04:23.880> looks<00:04:24.060> cool<00:04:24.300> I
