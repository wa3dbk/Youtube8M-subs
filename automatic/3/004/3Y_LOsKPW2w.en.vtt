00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
videos since 2007 or something so I'm

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.270 
videos since 2007 or something so I'm
used<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.239> cg<00:03:42.870> dancing<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.680> normal<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
used to cg dancing it's just normal and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.979 
used to cg dancing it's just normal and
it<00:03:44.549> looks<00:03:44.790> nice<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.450> they<00:03:45.510> could<00:03:45.660> do<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> lot<00:03:45.959> of

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
it looks nice and they could do a lot of

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.690 
it looks nice and they could do a lot of
moves<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.799> they<00:03:46.950> wouldn't<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.310> able<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.579> do

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
moves that they wouldn't be able to do

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.160 
moves that they wouldn't be able to do
with<00:03:47.880> regular<00:03:48.239> animation<00:03:48.750> because<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.079> would

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
with regular animation because it would

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.559 
with regular animation because it would
cost<00:03:49.380> way<00:03:49.590> too<00:03:49.620> much<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.269> whenever<00:03:51.269> they

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
cost way too much and whenever they

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.900 
cost way too much and whenever they
dance<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.139> starts<00:03:52.560> playing<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.250> brostep

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
dance it starts playing like brostep

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.120 
dance it starts playing like brostep
music<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:54.690> fucking<00:03:54.900> fantastic<00:03:55.230> i<00:03:55.950> love

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
it so definitely i look forward to more

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
it so definitely i look forward to more
of<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.900> was<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.079> first<00:04:01.290> episode

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
of that then that was the first episode

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.160 
of that then that was the first episode
of<00:04:01.650> shingeki<00:04:02.040> no<00:04:02.190> bahamut<00:04:02.819> which<00:04:03.150> was<00:04:03.480> kind<00:04:04.019> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
of shingeki no bahamut which was kind of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.680 
of shingeki no bahamut which was kind of
a<00:04:04.350> bit<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.220> clusterfuck<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.180> was<00:04:06.329> just<00:04:06.510> like

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
a bit of a clusterfuck it was just like

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.500 
a bit of a clusterfuck it was just like
stuff<00:04:07.170> happening<00:04:07.950> everywhere<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.819> was<00:04:09.209> pretty

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
stuff happening everywhere it was pretty

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.050 
stuff happening everywhere it was pretty
to<00:04:09.690> look<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.989> though<00:04:10.230> like<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.639> it's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
to look at though like it just it's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.479 
to look at though like it just it's
obvious<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:13.049> looks<00:04:13.380> just<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:14.010> attack

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
obvious that it looks just like attack

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.279 
obvious that it looks just like attack
on<00:04:14.700> Titan<00:04:15.090> which<00:04:15.299> is<00:04:15.420> funny<00:04:15.660> because<00:04:15.870> attack

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
on Titan which is funny because attack

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.409 
on Titan which is funny because attack
on<00:04:16.440> Titan<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.829> shingeki<00:04:17.220> no<00:04:17.489> Kyojin<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.299> this

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
on Titan is shingeki no Kyojin and this

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.140 
on Titan is shingeki no Kyojin and this
is<00:04:18.539> shingeki<00:04:18.780> no<00:04:19.049> bahamut<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.340> its<00:04:20.519> attack<00:04:20.940> on

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
is shingeki no bahamut so its attack on

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.080 
is shingeki no bahamut so its attack on
bahamut<00:04:21.630> essentially<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.610> they<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.880> same

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
bahamut essentially and they do the same

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.890 
bahamut essentially and they do the same
like

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
like

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.080 
like
matched<00:04:24.990> roof<00:04:25.380> walled<00:04:25.919> off<00:04:26.130> fantasy<00:04:26.820> world

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
matched roof walled off fantasy world

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.030 
matched roof walled off fantasy world
thing<00:04:27.540> they've<00:04:27.960> got<00:04:28.080> people<00:04:28.590> running<00:04:28.740> on

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
thing they've got people running on

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040 
thing they've got people running on
rooftops<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.850> really<00:04:30.150> good<00:04:30.300> animation<00:04:30.840> it's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
rooftops and really good animation it's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
rooftops and really good animation it's
like<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.410> looks<00:04:31.889> exactly<00:04:32.310> like<00:04:32.550> attack<00:04:33.150> on

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
like this looks exactly like attack on

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.650 
like this looks exactly like attack on
titan<00:04:33.720> dead<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.979> uh<00:04:35.009> but<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.880> it

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
matically not like that at all it's just

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.090 
matically not like that at all it's just

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
all like passionate about stuff I

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.719 
all like passionate about stuff I
thought<00:06:01.260> that<00:06:01.320> was<00:06:01.530> cool<00:06:01.800> but<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.370> didn't<00:06:02.639> know

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
thought that was cool but I didn't know

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.830 
thought that was cool but I didn't know
these<00:06:02.849> characters<00:06:03.090> well<00:06:03.419> enough<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.720> really

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
these characters well enough to really

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.379 
these characters well enough to really
care<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.139> much<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:04.830> if<00:06:05.190> they<00:06:05.550> do<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:06.030> again

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
care that much so if they do that again

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.300 
care that much so if they do that again
later<00:06:06.720> when<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.169> actually<00:06:07.440> do<00:06:07.860> care<00:06:08.039> about<00:06:08.099> the

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
later when I actually do care about the

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.409 
later when I actually do care about the
characters<00:06:08.460> maybe<00:06:08.880> it'll<00:06:09.060> be<00:06:09.150> interesting

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
characters maybe it'll be interesting

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.570 
characters maybe it'll be interesting
but<00:06:09.810> for<00:06:10.020> now<00:06:10.139> there<00:06:10.740> was<00:06:10.830> enough<00:06:11.099> laughs<00:06:11.400> in

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
but for now there was enough laughs in

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.980 
but for now there was enough laughs in
the<00:06:11.639> first<00:06:11.849> episode<00:06:12.000> that<00:06:12.389> I<00:06:12.419> felt<00:06:12.690> like<00:06:12.840> all

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
the first episode that I felt like all

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.510 
the first episode that I felt like all
right<00:06:13.169> I'll<00:06:13.349> keep<00:06:13.740> watching<00:06:14.130> this<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.430> looks

entertaining<00:06:14.849> enough<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:17.070> think<00:06:17.490> that

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
entertaining enough and I think that

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.480 
entertaining enough and I think that
that<00:06:18.060> is<00:06:18.270> all<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.690> I<00:06:19.169> watched<00:06:19.470> so<00:06:19.800> far<00:06:19.830> so
