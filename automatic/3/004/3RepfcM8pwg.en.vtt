I'm<00:00:13.590> starting<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.370> now<00:00:14.580> basically

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I'm starting with right now basically

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.330 
I'm starting with right now basically
you<00:00:15.870> know<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.350> place<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> shock<00:00:17.100> charge

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you know you can place a shock charge

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
you know you can place a shock charge
really<00:00:17.609> anywhere<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.779> lot<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> people<00:00:19.320> just

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
really anywhere and a lot of people just

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.109 
really anywhere and a lot of people just
place<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> ground<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
place it on the ground but one of the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.300 
place it on the ground but one of the
main<00:00:21.359> key<00:00:21.720> things<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
main key things that I do is I like to

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.160 
main key things that I do is I like to
place<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> top<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.420> door<00:00:24.810> frames

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
place it on the top of door frames

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
place it on the top of door frames
because<00:00:25.560> obviously<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.160> enemy<00:00:26.490> can't<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:27.000> if

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
because obviously the enemy can't see if

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120 
because obviously the enemy can't see if
they<00:00:27.240> can't<00:00:27.449> anticipate<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.890> believe

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
they can't anticipate it and I believe

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
they can't anticipate it and I believe
that's<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> smartest<00:00:30.150> places<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.050> lay

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that's one of the smartest places to lay

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
that's one of the smartest places to lay
them<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:32.040> plant<00:00:32.790> them<00:00:33.000> also<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.260> put

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
them or plant them also you can just put

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
them or plant them also you can just put
them<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> roof<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> room<00:00:36.180> if

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
roof and that is a great place to hide a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.680 
roof and that is a great place to hide a
shock<00:00:44.640> charge<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> people<00:00:45.629> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
shock charge not a lot of people are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
shock charge not a lot of people are
gonna<00:00:45.780> look<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.770> directly<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> roof<00:00:47.969> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
right here we did two tests one on the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.499 
right here we did two tests one on the
wall<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.130> floor<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.939> you'll<00:01:15.270> see

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
wall one on the floor and you'll see

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
wall one on the floor and you'll see
that<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> takes<00:01:16.380> away<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.770> HUD<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.310> reduces

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mobility for about one and a half

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
mobility for about one and a half
seconds<00:01:20.189> both<00:01:20.939> times<00:01:21.299> were<00:01:21.540> around<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
seconds both times were around that you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
seconds both times were around that you
know<00:01:23.460> general<00:01:24.000> time<00:01:24.479> frame<00:01:24.509> basically<00:01:25.110> around

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
know general time frame basically around

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
know general time frame basically around
1/2<00:01:25.950> seconds<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> show

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
1/2 seconds right here I want to show

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.910 
1/2 seconds right here I want to show
you<00:01:27.630> guys<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:28.110> happens<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.710> tack
