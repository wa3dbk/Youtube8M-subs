00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 from that fact that involved the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.089
 life risk of both 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.059
 I noticed that my life was marked for 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.290
 always I feel that my mood my 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.960
 trust and everything learned 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.240
 punctually until that moment it served me 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 to have more strength and to be able to leave 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 ahead 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.430
 On the one hand I am very strong but on the other 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.750
 very sensitive I was tired of being in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.160
 intensive therapy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 I wanted to disconnect at once for 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.130
 go out and see how vividly I perceived a peace 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.109
 incredible as a superior protection 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 over time I understood that it had been my 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.360
 dad who had made himself present for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.910
 give me strength and shelter as always one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 in my life I looked in astonishment faces 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.780
 of the doctors the nurses and the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 announcements because it was as if they were 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 seeing a ghost then I found out 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 that it is very strange that the one that survives 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.440
 syndrome the two mother them 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.410
 the black woman is really moved by the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.860
 It happened really bad really 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.470
 let's say that the body is not living 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.120
 the suspension that I had not expected 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.360
 that is never overcome 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.130
 He really was in this death giving 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.790
 turns and this I have to stay 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.790
 pregnant more 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.720
 especially because I did not know that the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.460
 virgin explained it to me like that obviously 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 but this one they explained to me they told me that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.050
 did not fill anything when I left because this 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.390
 in my nation can if I saw it when 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.700
 it was obviously born that after I saw it the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 next Sunday they let me out 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.470
 of therapy was in a wheelchair 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:02:01.149
 Marcela where and how long he was 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 45 45 days 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.770
 of the 25 nothing 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.050
 was there for five days supposedly 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.000
 I was going to be one but because the syndrome is 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.640
 treacherous and when you leave your body 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.900
 it settled in the kidneys that's why you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 I say you have to see a lot this 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 he has a substitute because the day s 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.360
 and more until that day of therapy that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.890
 they were talking to my family that I 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 they were going to do a transplant or dialysis 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.019
 and someone enters they feel in the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.629
 door of my therapy room between 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.260
 a wind will go this man I was all 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.670
 imaginary wired and I did not say that that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.730
 it seems that it is the obstetrician who saw the other 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 Once the guy was like a jorge angel 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.069
 because it came in I heard that I but what 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.599
 does is take out because the matrix of 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.920
 contrast had no entry of a new 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.139
 milestone that we are in the part of the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.909
 discussion like this in immediately 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:05.079
 the kidneys began to work and 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.079
 it was never more the same 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:13.800
 yes 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.140
 it works says it 's in the book it's 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.900
 the story apart from my story of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.560
 Fatima Flores tells me about her husband 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.260
 to her husband why I say her husband 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 for people to know was wrong 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.060
 little too but a few years ago the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.860
 heart go to the sanatorium gÃ¼emes and good 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.480
 supposedly they do not find anything 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.460
 use it the doctor let him go 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.170
 nurse lets him go when he is 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.940
 When a nurse appears from nowhere 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.250
 they do not know what hall he says he does not know 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.990
 go do not go you have to stop 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.460
 but the normal car is being sent to us 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.820
 do not go 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.230
 huelva returns makes a heart attack go to 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.640
 look for the nurse and if you never 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.380
 find is like an angel that 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.790
 disguised as a nurse you will understand 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.570
 but I understand that moment then 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.520
 never more 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.610
 no, never again 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.460
 I can not find it 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.460
 his name mons 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 those people that appear that I already 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.420
 I had heard from dad good my dad 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.390
 also because I at the moment because 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.120
 sounds the night before the cesarean 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.980
 I sent all my people my ex-husband to 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.240
 all that crap be quiet by 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.880
 oil the morning they prepared him for 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 necessary and I'm looking at that 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.860
 moment I thought it was joe buck turn off 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.080
 the TV and I'm going to sleep and stockings and 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.270
 back and I felt a hand that the nurse 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.180
 I'm going to get infected at 11 says again 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.550
 there was nobody but I felt it after 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.060
 good yes with everything that happens therapy 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.860
 I think it's very dad and I felt it was good 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.500
 that protected me the truth is that as 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.660
 that protected me I'm sorry I said that 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.100
 my dad just wrote letters and other things is 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.540
 as 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.410
 like in my way of being with him but 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.410
 being the same
