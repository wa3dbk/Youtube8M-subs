00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.540
 hello how about new friend london and 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.820
 francisco ruiz and I'm here again 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.060
 with another advice another application 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.140
 interesting this time for all 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.780
 users of lg g2 the 802 model 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.550
 although it should practically work 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.270
 in any rom stock or rom 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.480
 android kitkat well today what I love you 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.510
 show or teach is how to install the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.559
 lg camera - camera axis 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.530
 but with all its functions improved 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.449
 including slow video recording 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.300
 motion that is a camera recording 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.239
 slow real one of the things we have 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.729
 on axis 2 is that we can use the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.239
 slow motion function but recording 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.239
 forever 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.220
 in real time, I mean I mean 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.610
 from the video player itself 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.649
 ng we can lower the speed of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.810
 playback to watch it in slow motion 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.299
 but it's not going to be a recording that 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.549
 if they remain in slow motion with the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.280
 so today I bring you that is installed 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.610
 just like any apk we are going to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.330
 enable this slow motion feature 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.909
 specifically in the camera 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.710
 lg to record our videos already in 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.390
 slow motion now I'm going to make a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.270
 I show you the first thing that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.090
 we will have to do is download the apk 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.459
 I'm going to leave it in the link of the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.959
 video in the description of the video and we 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.759
 let's go to the folder where you 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.479
 we normally download in this case the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.159
 download folder and here below you can see 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.580
 the blue icon of the camera that puts x 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.060
 cam 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.500
 lg v 5 point 0 apk we're just going to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 give it to install 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.090
 and I get it is an update 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
 because I already have it installed but if 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.570
 you are going to install it though 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.210
 you have the original camera of the axis not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.550
 you're going to have to be afraid of chafar 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.830
 one camera on the other since the camera of the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.530
 axis is installed in the system in the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 app folder and it is installed in the root 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 in the data app folder or we're going to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 give it to install 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.350
 and we hope it will be installed if you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.230
 at this moment that you install him 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.380
 will comment on an update of the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.650
 camera I would advise you beforehand 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.379
 you were with the explorer bots 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.959
 to the route where the camera is installed 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.390
 and says do a backup in 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.280
 the sd card in case for anything 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.629
 it worked well, although I told you 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.909
 that in principle I should not give you 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.340
 problems or ask you update now 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.890
 which is installed in a different route well 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.230
 once installed we will leave the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.160
 explorer and I have it here that is the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.590
 blue icon 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.100
 I have the add-on cloud and g3 and already 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.100
 you know that I am 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.890
 fervent follower of this rooms of 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.350
 cloud and I can tell you that it's going to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 sensational although it does not include the camera 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.860
 of lg includes the shaft 3 camera well 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.440
 let's go to the camera settings 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.110
 and we can see how here in their own 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.650
 adjustments we are now in the photo 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.760
 we have more options enabled than in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.150
 the other camera since we can 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.170
 select qualities of a mega 3 mega 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.120
 5 megs 8 megs 10 megs and 13 megs but 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.520
 now what is really to me 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.250
 interesting is when we go to video 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.180
 from the entrance appointment 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.769
 we select the option 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.140
 as I already have slow motion enabled 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:56.040
 we have the quality 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 or hd efe hd to 60 frames efe hd or hd hd a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.050
 60 frames hd as you see we have many 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.870
 more qualities and many more societies 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.270
 to choose that the original camera of the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.700
 axis 2 the one that comes from itself or is itself 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.910
 series ok let's select slow 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.130
 motion and so you can see it's a video 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.260
 that is recorded in real time, that is, we are going to 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.239
 watch the recording in any 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.510
 video player finishes lens even 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.510
 If the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.860
 we export the recording to the computer 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.940
 enough specifically made in camera 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.580
 slow nothing to do with before not 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.160
 We could save the recording to camera 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.160
 slow well we select the bag let's go 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.800
 backwards and now I'm going to make a 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.560
 small recording throwing some object 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.660
 so you can see how it is recorded on camera 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.000
 slow already pulled for example this 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.720
 pen 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.400
 and I'm going to give you first record 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.400
 and we're going to launch it in 321 already 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:06.540
 recording 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.540
 and we're going to see how it was recorded 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.120
 let's go back 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.770
 let's go to the gallery 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.200
 to see if it has been saved or we have had 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.150
 any problem 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.770
 at the moment the video has not been saved 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.650
 let's repeat it 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.349
 I've tried it phenomenally before 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.840
 well what I have to tell you is what 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.220
 that usually happens that when you're going to do 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.460
 the video is when the 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.300
 failures well let's see that everything is 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.979
 okay slow motion we look back and 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.409
 let's do the recording again 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.480
 you might as well not let the button 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.680
 give him 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.740
 you can not start a relationship 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.110
 while there is another application that is 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.540
 we might be clear it 's because 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.129
 We are using the 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.099
 the camera 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.470
 we are using screen recording 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.360
 I guess we're going to see 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.720
 what we are going to do is that I'm going to cut 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.450
 the video I say goodbye to you and in the 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.010
 last part of the video I'll leave the 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:27.190
 recorded shot with several captures 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.540
 or several slow motion recordings for 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.520
 that you can see how it works 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.090
 perfectly now it has not worked for 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.919
 the fact that we are we are 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.169
 using the recorder to maintain 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.169
 although I'm going to close everything 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.530
 Let's see if we can do it that way 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.560
 stayed open let's open it again 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.420
 the camera let's go to the recording of 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.420
 video and let's try 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.610
 ok let's see what I said I'll 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.200
 to cut the video and I say goodbye 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.360
 you until the next time if you 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.800
 like the video agree to give me a 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.750
 like 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.759
 and good to see you in the next 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.849
 video I leave you with the recordings to 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:14.699
 slow motion slow motion with the modest 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.699
 of the axis camera until then friends 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.690
 ah
