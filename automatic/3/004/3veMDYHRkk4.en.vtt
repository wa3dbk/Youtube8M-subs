00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.469
 start this show we will be strafing the planes 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.760
 while airport authorities reassure themselves has managed his door 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.630
 today good intentions when we say that we will strafe the planes the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.250
 camera maker these crossbow optimizations also like 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 you do it like that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.140
 r at the edge of the runways to photograph the planes it bears a name the calls 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.379
 is author this journalist author of writings an association to defend 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.350
 their rights 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.339
 saleh 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.609
 live their passion is after going through easy to be spoofers 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.089
 when you are in belgium that's what they wanted to show that's what they have 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.879
 wanted to show this morning again at zaventem airport also our 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.879
 history of playing them sign anne figures manna 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.460
 at the burr 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 but here is the vision 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470
 I am obliged to their true passion 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.910
 they are crazy aviation for calls and squatters 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.370
 this morning the sky was perfectly clear so they gave themselves 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.460
 go as often to the slopes to make a maximum of snapshots 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.280
 a plane going by plane 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 not at all because different models and different colors 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.050
 and alitalia that universe storm 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.170
 air france passed in the north of the Basque coast because that seems to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 his place ap 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 photo ap photo it must be really peace in the world so we 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.000
 see the registrations so we can see in which the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120
 company asked the customers 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.890
 but of which we can also more artistic photos if you take three quarters 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.080
 about to the south it can no longer carry this name sounds a little more speed 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.250
 the place where they are installed is not bad to be operational in the 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.189
 2009 match builder is to be closer to the tarmac to see the 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.950
 to intervene and hear the noise of roads costs all the senses of the term 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.179
 he then takes another child to us near an airstrip 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.190
 but they will tell us 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.269
 but this is not the ideal place 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.620
 to the rank of fence and unfortunately we do not know why the protocol of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.279
 fence but what is well abroad his younger 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.359
 the united states order mounds of land that are found near 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.139
 these places how can one succumb the barriers against the troops of his 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.669
 rival 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.649
 so it's true that the others despite an association to defend 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.319
 their interests 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.269
 he would like that, like what exists in other European countries 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.369
 infrastructure is planned to vote 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.989
 of heart finding the fences or even observation deck which 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.729
 will determine it would seem besides the coatings of fraudsters be better 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:42.719
 taken into account 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.730
 so we put the question to the airport management of 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.209
 Brussels-National 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.680
 Monday after there are airports that have lowered their stimulating effects 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.499
 for 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:56.269
 some infrastructure that specifically facilitates for the spot r 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.299
 it was 18 to 15 years ago 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.079
 % and by built since 2009 what happened in new york 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.769
 from others in europe this constancy terrorists allah ya when 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.060
 even a change by european tour all over the world that make 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.969
 fear 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.799
 less and less scared between two possibilities to approach wow 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.599
 tracked to approach the planes 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.769
 I surfed obliged but also for economic reasons and 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.139
 amenities to make their lives easier it is not a priority but 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.040
 it will not take away the pleasure of finding their feet in a 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.739
 change 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.110
 but the goal arrived to heaven to share their passion 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.689
 if you think there are big cities in the heart of new york or london 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.709
 to cheat you up to the volume that organizes days also to 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.290
 charleroi liÃ¨pvre spotting day photos that you can 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.649
 find on the website 300w points 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.109
 it's the end of our point of view
