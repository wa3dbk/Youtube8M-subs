place called curl and go as you can see
now<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.820> particular<00:00:18.240> play

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
now one thing about this particular play

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.150 
now one thing about this particular play
is<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> slot<00:00:19.410> wide<00:00:19.590> receivers<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.130> a

is that this slot wide receivers on a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
is that this slot wide receivers on a
awkward<00:00:20.789> curl<00:00:21.090> route<00:00:21.300> goes<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.650> then

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
awkward curl route goes in up and then

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
awkward curl route goes in up and then
curls<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> throw<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.480> before<00:00:24.779> he

you're<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.750> inside<00:01:04.110> position

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you're going to get that inside position

you're going to get that inside position
now<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.339> start<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> coverage

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
now if they start back in the coverage

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590 
now if they start back in the coverage
up<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.260> won't<00:01:07.770> work<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.189> effectively<00:01:08.700> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
up the go won't work as effectively but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.440 
up the go won't work as effectively but
if<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
if they do do that what we can do and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060 
if they do do that what we can do and
what<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> watch<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
what we also have to watch for is the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
what we also have to watch for is the
extra<00:01:14.369> defender<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.750> running<00:01:16.080> back

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
extra defender so the running back

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
extra defender so the running back
doesn't<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:17.189> sure<00:01:17.220> his<00:01:17.610> defender

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
doesn't go out make sure his defender

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999 
doesn't go out make sure his defender
doesn't<00:01:18.270> double<00:01:18.780> team<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.409> y<00:01:19.560> receiver<00:01:19.920> on

streak<00:01:36.290> towards<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> inside<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.909> another

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
streak towards the inside now another

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
streak towards the inside now another
thing<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.900> backup<00:01:40.259> coverage<00:01:40.470> we

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
thing is if they backup coverage we

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
thing is if they backup coverage we
could<00:01:40.829> throw<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.009> curl<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.579> slot<00:01:41.850> again

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
could throw that curl in the slot again

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.710 
could throw that curl in the slot again
but<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.320> makes<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.860> play<00:01:44.570> special<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
but what makes this play special and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
but what makes this play special and
what<00:01:45.869> makes<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.259> route<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> believe<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> best

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
what makes this route I believe the best

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
what makes this route I believe the best
in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> game<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.020> throw<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
in the game is that we can throw it as a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.639 
in the game is that we can throw it as a
curl<00:01:50.070> also<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.140> backing<00:01:52.409> off

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
curl also so if they are backing off

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
curl also so if they are backing off
coverage<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.579> throw<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
coverage what we can do is just throw it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.399 
coverage what we can do is just throw it
as<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> curl<00:01:54.390> rather<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:54.899> trying<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> hit<00:01:55.320> them

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
as a curl rather than trying to hit them

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
as a curl rather than trying to hit them
with<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.520> how<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.880> throw<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
with the go now how do we throw it as a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
with the go now how do we throw it as a
curl<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.200> need<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.860> throw<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> hard

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
curl all we need to do is throw a hard

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.630 
curl all we need to do is throw a hard
bullet<00:02:00.299> pass<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:01.200> before<00:02:01.409> he's<00:02:02.100> breaking

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
bullet pass just before he's breaking

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
bullet pass just before he's breaking
you<00:02:03.180> are<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> practice<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you are going to want to practice this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.100 
you are going to want to practice this
because<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> timing<00:02:05.399> route

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
because this is a timing route

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.359 
because this is a timing route
fortunately<00:02:07.110> there's<00:02:07.320> no<00:02:07.530> path<00:02:07.799> lead<00:02:08.129> it's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
fortunately there's no path lead it's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.430 
fortunately there's no path lead it's
just<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> hard<00:02:08.849> bullet<00:02:09.209> pass<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.989> once<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.289> get

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
just a hard bullet pass so once you get

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.980 
just a hard bullet pass so once you get
the<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.920> you'll<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.099> good<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the time and you'll be good to go and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.740 
the time and you'll be good to go and
you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.040> throw<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.490> before<00:02:15.090> right

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you know just throw it before right

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.440 
you know just throw it before right
before<00:02:15.860> he<00:02:16.860> makes<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.400> break<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.300> you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
before he makes that break and as you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.480 
before he makes that break and as you
can<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.630> he'll<00:02:18.960> turn<00:02:19.140> around<00:02:19.530> he'll<00:02:19.830> stop<00:02:20.160> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
can see he'll turn around he'll stop and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.610 
can see he'll turn around he'll stop and
he'll<00:02:21.030> run<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.930> he<00:02:22.110> runs<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> curl

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
he'll run it just as he runs the curl

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
he'll run it just as he runs the curl
route<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:23.880> start<00:02:24.150> pressing<00:02:24.390> again

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
route then if they start pressing again

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.050 
route then if they start pressing again
you<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.860> hit<00:02:25.980> them<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.250> go<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you know we can hit them with the go the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.340 
you know we can hit them with the go the
other<00:02:27.180> thing<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.630> they're<00:02:27.900> running<00:02:28.020> mat

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
other thing is if they're running mat

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650 
other thing is if they're running mat
press<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.010> still<00:02:29.340> run<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> curl<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
press we can still run the curl so it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.730 
press we can still run the curl so it
doesn't<00:02:30.900> matter<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.140> they're<00:02:31.290> running<00:02:31.440> man

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
doesn't matter if they're running man

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.320 
doesn't matter if they're running man
press<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.340> running<00:02:32.760> backed<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.150> man

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
press or the running backed up man

press or the running backed up man
coverage<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.960> can<00:02:34.110> always<00:02:34.290> run<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.620> curl

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
coverage we can always run the curl

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.040 
coverage we can always run the curl
because<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.360> successful<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
because it's going to be successful and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.050 
because it's going to be successful and
he'll<00:02:37.200> get<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.530> inside<00:02:37.830> position<00:02:38.070> corner

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
he'll get that inside position corner

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.730 
he'll get that inside position corner
will<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.300> facing<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.990> field<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.440> will<00:02:40.620> be

turned around facing the quarterback and
we'll<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> good<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.110> go<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.770> see<00:02:43.950> here

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
we'll be good to go as you can see here

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.850 
we'll be good to go as you can see here
it<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.550> gets<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.320> reception

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
it just gets you know a nice reception

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.970 
it just gets you know a nice reception
10<00:02:47.430> yards<00:02:47.850> roughly<00:02:48.540> every<00:02:48.780> time<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.380> we'll

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
10 yards roughly every time and we'll

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.550 
10 yards roughly every time and we'll
take<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.340> all<00:02:50.520> day<00:02:50.550> long<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.380> throw

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
take that all day long and we can throw

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
take that all day long and we can throw
this<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:52.950> either<00:02:53.550> side<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.180> play<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.630> you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
this on either side on this play but you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
this on either side on this play but you
can<00:02:54.990> find<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.410> curl<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.830> go<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.220> other<00:02:56.730> plays

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
can find this curl and go in other plays

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.690 
can find this curl and go in other plays
and<00:02:57.510> other<00:02:58.020> formations<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.070> definitely<00:02:59.460> just

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and other formations so definitely just

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.310 
and other formations so definitely just
be<00:02:59.820> looking<00:03:00.150> out<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.600> route<00:03:00.840> because<00:03:01.020> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
be looking out for this route because it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.650 
be looking out for this route because it
is<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> very<00:03:01.770> very<00:03:02.010> effective<00:03:02.550> route<00:03:02.730> against

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
is a very very effective route against

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.690 
is a very very effective route against
man<00:03:03.870> defense<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.680> against<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.980> cover<00:03:05.280> threes

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
man defense now against the cover threes

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.690 
man defense now against the cover threes
what<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.040> flat<00:03:08.400> zone

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
what we like to do is if the flat zone

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.240 
what we like to do is if the flat zone
if<00:03:09.420> they<00:03:09.630> move<00:03:09.810> him<00:03:10.140> or<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.590> he<00:03:10.620> has<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.070> cover

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
if they move him or if he has to cover

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.220 
if they move him or if he has to cover
some<00:03:11.550> ground<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.510> definitely<00:03:12.690> still<00:03:13.020> hit

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
some ground we can definitely still hit

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.900 
some ground we can definitely still hit
the<00:03:13.260> curl<00:03:13.590> but<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:13.980> watch<00:03:14.190> out<00:03:14.430> because<00:03:14.610> they

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
the curl but do watch out because they

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.000 
the curl but do watch out because they
can't<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.300> picked<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.290> flat<00:03:16.560> zones<00:03:16.830> on

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
can't get picked off that flat zones on

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.370 
can't get picked off that flat zones on
that<00:03:17.190> area<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> main<00:03:18.990> thing<00:03:19.020> that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that area but the main thing that's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.300 
that area but the main thing that's
going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.560> make<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.830> play<00:03:20.070> effective

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
going to make this play effective

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.670 
going to make this play effective
against<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.720> goal<00:03:21.900> part<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.590> we

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
against that is the goal part and all we

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.550 
against that is the goal part and all we
need<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.310> again<00:03:23.940> inside<00:03:24.480> pass<00:03:24.840> lead<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
need to do is again inside pass lead and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
need to do is again inside pass lead and
we'll<00:03:26.190> get<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.550> inside<00:03:27.000> position<00:03:27.240> between

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
we'll get that inside position between

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.380 
we'll get that inside position between
the<00:03:27.990> zones<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.560> be<00:03:28.800> able<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.100> get<00:03:29.280> nice<00:03:29.880> chunks

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
the zones and be able to get nice chunks

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.720 
the zones and be able to get nice chunks
of<00:03:30.480> yards<00:03:30.840> down<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.170> field<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.950> making<00:03:32.640> this

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
of yards down the field and making this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.340 
of yards down the field and making this
play<00:03:32.970> very<00:03:33.210> effective<00:03:33.600> against<00:03:33.810> cover<00:03:34.020> three

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
play very effective against cover three

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.670 
play very effective against cover three
now<00:03:34.830> against<00:03:35.040> cover<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:36.380> what's<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.620> to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
now against cover for what's going to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.140 
now against cover for what's going to
happen<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.220> slot<00:03:38.490> wide<00:03:38.670> receiver<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
happen is that slot wide receiver is

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.520 
happen is that slot wide receiver is
going<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.360> take<00:03:39.540> away<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.870> purple<00:03:40.170> zone<00:03:40.350> or

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
going to take away the purple zone or

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.300 
going to take away the purple zone or
the<00:03:40.560> hooks<00:03:40.800> are<00:03:40.980> um<00:03:41.280> buzz<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.100> left

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the hooks are um buzz on so on the left

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.250 
the hooks are um buzz on so on the left
side<00:03:44.520> we<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.880> still<00:03:45.120> throw<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.480> as<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> curl<00:03:45.990> or

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
side we can still throw it as a curl or

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.760 
side we can still throw it as a curl or
we<00:03:46.740> can<00:03:46.890> throw<00:03:47.100> outside<00:03:48.090> bullet<00:03:48.510> pass<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:49.590> get

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
we can throw outside bullet pass to get

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.290 
we can throw outside bullet pass to get
outside<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.280> defenders<00:03:50.820> now<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.090> isn't

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
outside the defenders now this isn't

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.550 
outside the defenders now this isn't
something<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.810> want<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.020> throw<00:03:52.140> every<00:03:52.350> time

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
something you want to throw every time

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280 
something you want to throw every time
but<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.160> can<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.580> very<00:03:53.900> decent<00:03:54.900> against<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
but it can be very decent against the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.110 
but it can be very decent against the
cover<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.800> another<00:03:56.490> thing<00:03:56.700> we<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:56.970> do<00:03:57.090> is

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
cover for another thing we can do is

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030 
cover for another thing we can do is
make<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> curl<00:03:57.690> flat<00:03:57.960> concept<00:03:58.500> which<00:03:58.620> will<00:03:58.830> suck

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
make a curl flat concept which will suck

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.880 
make a curl flat concept which will suck
down<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.510> buzz<00:04:00.510> own<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:01.500> leave<00:04:01.740> our

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
down the buzz own and then leave our

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.210 
down the buzz own and then leave our
wide<00:04:02.070> receiver<00:04:02.490> wide<00:04:02.670> open<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.840> curl

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
wide receiver wide open for the curl

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.470 
wide receiver wide open for the curl
till<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> next<00:04:05.340> time<00:04:05.610> manageable<00:04:06.210> monster

till the next time manageable monster

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.100 
till the next time manageable monster
