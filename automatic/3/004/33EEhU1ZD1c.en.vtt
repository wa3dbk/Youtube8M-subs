Sony's<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.809> using<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.320> names<00:00:43.590> such

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
Sony's been using different names such

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
Sony's been using different names such
as<00:00:44.370> dual<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.300> tap<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:45.989> more

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
as dual and tap these are more

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
as dual and tap these are more
descriptive<00:00:46.500> names<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.520> Sony<00:00:48.059> seems<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> be

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
descriptive names and Sony seems to be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.270 
descriptive names and Sony seems to be
doing<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> pushing<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
doing that they're kind of pushing that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
doing that they're kind of pushing that
into<00:00:50.489> their<00:00:50.700> laptops<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.449> well<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:52.620> now

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
into their laptops as well because now

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
into their laptops as well because now
they're<00:00:53.010> renaming<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.699> mainstream<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
they're renaming their mainstream that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.430 
they're renaming their mainstream that
laptops<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.500> fit<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> goes<00:00:58.289> by

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
laptops to fit so if it kind of goes by

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.220 
laptops to fit so if it kind of goes by
the<00:00:58.500> logo<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.760> slogan<00:01:00.329> fit<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.870> everyone

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the logo like or slogan fit for everyone

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
the logo like or slogan fit for everyone
so<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> standard<00:01:02.850> mainstream

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so these are the standard mainstream

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.060 
so these are the standard mainstream
laptops<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.290> you'll<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.650> able<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
laptops that you'll be able to get

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 
laptops that you'll be able to get
there's<00:01:05.549> two<00:01:05.850> different<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.420> models<00:01:06.930> under

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
there's two different like models under

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
there's two different like models under
this<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.909> eat

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this which is like you can get they eat

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
this which is like you can get they eat
like<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.750> an<00:01:09.840> entry-level<00:01:10.229> e<00:01:10.680> series<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.580> these

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like at an entry-level e series it these

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
like at an entry-level e series it these
are<00:01:12.150> similar<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> entry-level<00:01:13.080> e<00:01:13.439> series

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
are similar to the entry-level e series

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
are similar to the entry-level e series
and<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.100> similar<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> t<00:01:15.150> line<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.780> was

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and it's similar to the t line that was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
and it's similar to the t line that was
from<00:01:16.259> before<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> guys<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
from before so if you guys know how the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
from before so if you guys know how the
series<00:01:18.900> line<00:01:19.290> worked<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.220> before<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> fit

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
series line worked from before the fit

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
series line worked from before the fit
series<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.680> are

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
series then this is what they are

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
series then this is what they are
they're<00:01:23.100> similar<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> e<00:01:23.670> series<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they're similar to the e series and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
they're similar to the e series and
they're<00:01:24.600> also<00:01:24.840> similar<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> T<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.130> they're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they're also similar to the T so they're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
they're also similar to the T so they're
more<00:01:26.460> low-end<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> fit<00:01:28.140> includes<00:01:28.740> low-end

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
more low-end so the fit includes low-end

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
more low-end so the fit includes low-end
models<00:01:29.729> such<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.150> fit<00:01:30.420> 14<00:01:30.780> II<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.740> fit

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
models such as a fit 14 II and the fit
15<00:01:32.130> II<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.180> include<00:01:33.600> premium

higher<00:02:47.670> than<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.270> standard<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.900> believe<00:02:48.930> it's

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
higher than the standard I believe it's

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.670 
higher than the standard I believe it's
13<00:02:49.830> something<00:02:50.340> by<00:02:50.490> 768<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.720> believe<00:02:52.350> that's<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
13 something by 768 I believe that's the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
13 something by 768 I believe that's the
standard<00:02:53.070> which<00:02:53.670> most<00:02:54.000> manufacturers<00:02:54.660> use

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
standard which most manufacturers use

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.270 
standard which most manufacturers use
but<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.740> something's<00:02:56.070> kind<00:02:56.160> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
but I see that something's kind of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.000 
but I see that something's kind of
pushing<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.910> 1600<00:02:57.660> by<00:02:57.780> 900<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.800> that's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
pushing it up to 1600 by 900 so that's

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.670 
pushing it up to 1600 by 900 so that's
really<00:02:59.190> good<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.490> hear<00:02:59.990> anyways<00:03:00.990> if<00:03:01.200> both<00:03:01.500> the
