independent<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.930> possible<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> had<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> stop

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
independent as possible so I had to stop

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
independent as possible so I had to stop
considering<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.750> drive<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

and legs should be and this is very

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
and legs should be and this is very
important<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> variety<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.299> reasons

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
important for a variety of reasons

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.710 
important for a variety of reasons
firstly<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.010> is<00:01:23.070> very<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
firstly it is very easy for me to get in

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.990 
firstly it is very easy for me to get in
and<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> car<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.400> bang<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.759> knees

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and out of the car and not bang my knees

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
and out of the car and not bang my knees
or<00:01:27.240> legs<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.689> anything<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.470> there's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
or legs on anything because there's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
or legs on anything because there's
nothing<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> bang<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> having

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
nothing to bang them on and having

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
nothing to bang them on and having
driven<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.110> other<00:01:31.260> systems<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.190> safely

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
driven with other systems I can safely

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.070 
driven with other systems I can safely
say<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.690> more<00:01:33.870> room

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
say that there is a lot more room

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.050 
say that there is a lot more room
another<00:01:34.890> thing<00:01:35.160> that<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
another thing that I like is that it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.150 
another thing that I like is that it
looks<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.480> lot<00:01:36.660> nicer<00:01:36.840> apart<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> actual

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
looks a lot nicer apart from the actual

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.490 
looks a lot nicer apart from the actual
lever<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.540> hard<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> tell<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
lever it is very hard to tell that this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
lever it is very hard to tell that this
car<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:40.980> actually<00:01:41.310> been<00:01:41.460> adapted<00:01:42.000> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
car has actually been adapted it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
car has actually been adapted it's
important<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.620> notice<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.400> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> very

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
important to notice that this is a very

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
important to notice that this is a very
unobtrusive<00:01:45.300> system<00:01:46.050> an<00:01:46.200> able-bodied<00:01:47.100> driver

about the tech mobility system is how

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.600 
about the tech mobility system is how
well<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.540> drives<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.769> has<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> longer<00:02:55.280> lever

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
well it drives it has a longer lever

which<00:02:57.890> makes<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.310> lot<00:02:58.579> easier<00:02:59.150> to

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
which makes it a lot easier to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.670 
which makes it a lot easier to
accelerate<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:01.040> use<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.610> long<00:03:01.940> journeys

for<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> same<00:03:04.010> reason<00:03:04.489> braking<00:03:05.060> with<00:03:05.239> this

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
for the same reason braking with this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420 
for the same reason braking with this
hand<00:03:05.659> control<00:03:06.019> will<00:03:06.230> be<00:03:06.260> smoother<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.040> more

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
hand control will be smoother and more

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.490 
hand control will be smoother and more
progressive<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.959> an<00:03:09.079> emergency

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
progressive and in an emergency

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.380 
progressive and in an emergency
situation<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:10.430> will<00:03:10.579> be<00:03:10.670> much<00:03:10.909> easier<00:03:10.940> to

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
situation it will be much easier to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.440 
situation it will be much easier to
apply<00:03:11.780> real<00:03:12.349> braking<00:03:12.950> force<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> hope

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
apply real braking force so I hope

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.240
