on<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.880> video<00:00:18.560> we're<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> go<00:00:19.890> over<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on this video we're going to go over the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.330 
on this video we're going to go over the
intermediate<00:00:20.820> technique<00:00:21.500> for<00:00:22.500> dowsing<00:00:22.830> or

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
intermediate technique for dowsing or

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.810 
intermediate technique for dowsing or
divine<00:00:24.270> gesture<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:25.279> this<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.490> we're<00:00:26.700> going

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
divine gesture on this one we're going

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.569 
divine gesture on this one we're going
to<00:00:26.880> go<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.419> more<00:00:27.599> in-depth<00:00:28.050> protocol<00:00:28.590> giving

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
to go in a more in-depth protocol giving

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.060 
to go in a more in-depth protocol giving
more<00:00:29.789> attention<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> areas<00:00:31.169> specifically

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
more attention to the areas specifically

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.209 
more attention to the areas specifically
rather<00:00:32.489> than<00:00:32.730> doing<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.360> general<00:00:33.750> sense

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
rather than doing it in a general sense

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.680 
rather than doing it in a general sense
even<00:00:35.219> though<00:00:35.370> doing<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> general<00:00:36.420> sense

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
even though doing it in a general sense

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
even though doing it in a general sense
will<00:00:37.230> alleviate<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.070> problems<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
will alleviate the problems if you do it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.170 
will alleviate the problems if you do it
enough<00:00:39.480> times<00:00:40.309> doing<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> more<00:00:41.940> specific

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
enough times doing it in a more specific

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.720 
enough times doing it in a more specific
sense<00:00:42.980> starting<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.070> general<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.640> then

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
sense starting out general and then

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
sense starting out general and then
moving<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.180> specific<00:00:45.719> areas<00:00:46.100> will<00:00:47.100> help

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
moving into specific areas will help

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.880 
moving into specific areas will help
bring<00:00:47.730> specific<00:00:48.390> attention<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.500> energies

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
bring specific attention to the energies

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
bring specific attention to the energies
that<00:00:50.100> need<00:00:50.310> it<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.690> give<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.840> better

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that need it and give you a better

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
that need it and give you a better
understanding<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.760> client<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
understanding of what the client is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
understanding of what the client is
going<00:00:54.600> through<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.220> intermediate

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
going through so in this intermediate

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.500 
going through so in this intermediate
video<00:00:57.500> again<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.220> should<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.940> able<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> do

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
video again you should be able to do

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860 
video again you should be able to do
divine<00:01:01.410> gesture<00:01:01.860> by<00:01:02.040> now<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.970> if<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.270> no<00:01:03.840> big

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
divine gesture by now but if not no big

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.620 
divine gesture by now but if not no big
deal<00:01:04.290> use<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.100> rod<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:06.000> pendulum<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
deal use your rod or your pendulum and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
deal use your rod or your pendulum and
you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> accomplish<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.500> exact<00:01:07.860> same<00:01:08.070> thing

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you can accomplish the exact same thing

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.090 
you can accomplish the exact same thing
but<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.329> remember<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.350> church<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.860> town

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but just remember that in church in town

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.020 
but just remember that in church in town
we<00:01:11.579> try<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.649> distance<00:01:13.649> ourselves<00:01:13.770> from<00:01:14.280> tools

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we try to distance ourselves from tools

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.410 
we try to distance ourselves from tools
tools<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.990> fine<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.520> real<00:01:17.759> power<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
tools are fine but the real power is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
tools are fine but the real power is
inside<00:01:19.049> us<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:21.560> we're<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> look

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
inside us so we're going to take a look

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.680 
inside us so we're going to take a look
at<00:01:24.290> subcategories<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> main<00:01:27.150> five

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
at subcategories of the main five

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.560 
at subcategories of the main five
categories<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> those<00:01:29.460> main<00:01:30.299> five

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
categories and those main five

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.800 
categories and those main five
categories<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> course<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.740> spiritual

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
categories of course are spiritual

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.840 
categories of course are spiritual
emotional<00:01:34.040> physical<00:01:35.840> energetic<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> other

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
emotional physical energetic and other

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.420 
emotional physical energetic and other
okay<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.510> break<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:40.920> into

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
okay they break down all of them into

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.560 
okay they break down all of them into
two<00:01:41.670> sub<00:01:42.360> categories<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.890> three<00:01:44.310> sub<00:01:45.270> sub

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
two sub categories with three sub sub

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.130 
two sub categories with three sub sub
categories<00:01:46.170> inside<00:01:47.010> them<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.060> we'll<00:01:49.020> go

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
categories inside them and we'll go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.320 
categories inside them and we'll go
through<00:01:49.380> those<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.740> first<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.729> always<00:01:51.060> start

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
through those now first we always start

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.600 
through those now first we always start
off<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.720> removing<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.290> resistances<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.400> any

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
off with removing all resistances of any

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.550 
off with removing all resistances of any
type<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.970> start<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.420> first<00:01:54.450> once<00:01:55.350> we've

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
type we start there first once we've

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.880 
type we start there first once we've
done<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.240> we<00:01:57.240> move<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> spiritual

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
done that we move on to the spiritual

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
done that we move on to the spiritual
category<00:01:59.270> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> spiritual<00:02:00.840> category

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
category in the spiritual category

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.340 
category in the spiritual category
breaks<00:02:01.890> down<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.880> sub<00:02:02.909> categories<00:02:03.350> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
breaks down into two sub categories so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.719 
breaks down into two sub categories so
to<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.530> spiritual<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> comes

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to have spiritual and then that comes

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.359 
to have spiritual and then that comes
down<00:02:05.880> into<00:02:06.150> paranormal<00:02:07.140> activity<00:02:07.710> which

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
down into paranormal activity which

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.660 
down into paranormal activity which
would<00:02:08.549> be<00:02:10.069> anomaly<00:02:11.750> entity<00:02:12.829> demonic<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.099> then

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
would be anomaly entity demonic and then

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.009 
would be anomaly entity demonic and then
it<00:02:14.760> breaks<00:02:14.879> down<00:02:15.090> into<00:02:15.269> another<00:02:15.599> category

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it breaks down into another category

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.800 
it breaks down into another category
from<00:02:16.769> spiritual<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.239> spiritual

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
from spiritual so you have spiritual

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.990 
from spiritual so you have spiritual
comes<00:02:19.170> down<00:02:19.349> into<00:02:19.620> two<00:02:19.860> over<00:02:20.579> here<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.879> have

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
comes down into two over here we have

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.850 
comes down into two over here we have
the<00:02:21.120> psychic<00:02:21.540> category<00:02:22.230> which<00:02:22.620> would<00:02:22.770> be

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the psychic category which would be

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.550 
the psychic category which would be
psychic<00:02:23.280> protection<00:02:23.720> psychic<00:02:24.720> detachment<00:02:25.440> or

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
psychic protection psychic detachment or

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.630 
psychic protection psychic detachment or
psychic<00:02:26.099> attack<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.730> pain

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
psychic attack or pain

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.810 
psychic attack or pain
and<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.600> three<00:02:28.960> sub<00:02:29.920> subcategories

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
and so we have three sub subcategories

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.130 
and so we have three sub subcategories
of<00:02:31.000> spiritual<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.000> emotional<00:02:34.570> category

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
of spiritual from the emotional category

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.720 
of spiritual from the emotional category
it<00:02:35.500> breaks<00:02:35.770> down<00:02:35.890> into<00:02:36.220> two<00:02:36.430> sub<00:02:36.670> categories

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it breaks down into two sub categories
