00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.140
 this evil was done by the same creator 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.059
 that the other of the battery that is the disc is the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.969

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.390
 same complex type you can not understand 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.370
 a lot of 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.170
 But good, folks, go back and bring it. 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 I think the two maps in the week will 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.670
 depending on you indicate me maps 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.440
 also there in the comments galera and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.149
 also if you want the series to continue 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 left the staff always at all times 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.240
 videos right 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.460
 come on is how does this map 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.800
 above it is quite different is the fact it is 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.920
 much more difficult than the other or 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.990
 A lot, that 's a lot, but before you 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 had malan and battery placement 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.850
 Playing this one is kind of complicated. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.970
 Friends, complicated, like the people. 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.220
 already was going to be the next you will have 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.770
 that leave there wanka up here or 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.250
 underneath here below you click 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.500
 in start loop start loop and you see that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.729
 There are guitar chords to whoever plays 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.790
 guitar knows right 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:49.939
 here is the river thinks is my standard 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 history that is the val sun hello gave us is 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.180
 the sun back also goes in the whole chords 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.579
 here and you are going to play the galleys go 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.799
 start getting in the sun for the 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.729
 sun also sang mano if you want to follow 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.729
 I think I just know that they go there. 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.030
 and how much you mom keeps you your body 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.709
 on top 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 He goes with the ringing wake up you go. 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.300
 change acord time to change according 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.269
 Like you have to go before kind in the middle. 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.530
 when replacing the transition acord you 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.890
 Go if not the double way is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890
 folks 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.110
 the place is half double each room has 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.530
 their sound show everything to you that the O O 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.530
 mouth 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.890
 I find the easiest and even jumping 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.709
 with somewhat affect the old music or 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.260
 together imagine playing that map of 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.930
 battery but this will give a band 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.959

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.060
 like a bomb of a really cool song o 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.890
