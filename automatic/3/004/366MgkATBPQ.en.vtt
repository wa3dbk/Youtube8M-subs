 by maxim andreev nays sergei shevchuk 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 Allah turned out this groove and violation 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 it was necessary a violation and no yellow 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.639
 No card seemed that the main 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.260
 the referee of the meeting pulled up I think that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.490
 this moment probably now 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.900
 apogee can be the whole meeting if 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 score compare then of course it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.740
 need to do right now, Vladimir 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.740
 Romanenko showed that can already slyly 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.740
 to play 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 his head and you know Artem Fedorov already 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 came running the penalty Alexander Gorbatyuk 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.129
 football player about whom we said that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.949
 he can score he is carrager style 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.799

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:05.369
 did my business already on added 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:09.159
 note and fluff can exhale of course 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.990
 crazy absolutely moments vladimir 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.049
 Romanenko made this transfer she 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.240
 It turned out the exact same you know 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.659
 homing and alexander gorbatyuk 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.720
 scores such a necessary goal of this trait 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.850
 just talking about the fact that those who went to 80 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.250
 minute that they were wrong having gone and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 skipping such a goal and these 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 the fans here they are they waited 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.470
 I think her team will be happy 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.039
 And this is not good. Well, 22 friends are good. 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.330
 combat match we looked and not 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.909
 teams in general then together and further 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.039
