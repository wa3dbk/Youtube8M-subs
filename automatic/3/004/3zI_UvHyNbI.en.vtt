Watts shop light bulbs and they work
really<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.149> ballast<00:00:33.750> inside<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
really well but the ballast inside of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.700 
really well but the ballast inside of
this<00:00:34.920> fixture<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:36.510> says<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.190> use

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
this fixture also says that it can use

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.569 
this fixture also says that it can use
ev32<00:00:40.710> t8<00:00:41.670> bulbs<00:00:42.440> any<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.649> those<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.469> I'm

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
ev32 t8 bulbs any of those so I'm

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.310 
ev32 t8 bulbs any of those so I'm
thinking<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> people<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
thinking that the people that put the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
thinking that the people that put the
information<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> box<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.180> sticker

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
information on the box and the sticker

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.100 
information on the box and the sticker
on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> fixture<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.309> here

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
on the fixture which is right here

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
on the fixture which is right here
couldn't<00:00:55.110> read<00:00:55.350> anything<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
couldn't read anything that is on the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.680 
couldn't read anything that is on the
ballast

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
ballast

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
ballast
so<00:00:58.559> anyways<00:00:59.449> other<00:01:00.449> than<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.309> let's<00:01:02.309> turn

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so anyways other than that let's turn

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.700 
so anyways other than that let's turn
this<00:01:02.940> thing<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
this thing on

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
this thing on
no<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.519> kind<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.479> says<00:01:06.680> electronic

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
no it has kind of a it says electronic

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.090 
no it has kind of a it says electronic
rapid<00:01:08.220> start<00:01:08.520> ballast<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:10.890> let's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
rapid start ballast but here we go let's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.410 
rapid start ballast but here we go let's
plug<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:12.890> lights<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.460> fast<00:01:14.700> with

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
plug it in lights up really fast with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.830 
plug it in lights up really fast with
absolutely<00:01:16.200> no<00:01:16.500> noise<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.570> quiet

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
absolutely no noise it's really quiet

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
absolutely no noise it's really quiet
and<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.450> works<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.810> well<00:01:28.070> see<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and I think works really well see it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
and I think works really well see it
doesn't<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.950> any<00:01:32.329> um<00:01:33.329> flicker<00:01:33.960> or

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
doesn't really have any um flicker or

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
doesn't really have any um flicker or
anything<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:35.100> turning<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.909> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
anything when turning on it's just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
anything when turning on it's just
instant<00:01:36.600> start<00:01:36.960> bla<00:01:37.939> nothing<00:01:38.939> too<00:01:39.119> fancy<00:01:40.610> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
instant start bla nothing too fancy so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
instant start bla nothing too fancy so
let's<00:01:42.150> show<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.540> own<00:01:42.720> fixture<00:01:43.200> okay<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
let's show your own fixture okay so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
let's show your own fixture okay so
here's<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> sticker<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> fixture<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> took

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
here's the sticker on the fixture I took

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.399 
here's the sticker on the fixture I took
the<00:01:46.049> bulbs<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> better<00:01:47.850> as

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
the bulbs out so we can see it better as

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.210 
the bulbs out so we can see it better as
you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> says<00:01:50.189> use<00:01:50.460> only<00:01:50.990> t12<00:01:52.220> bulbs

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you can see it says use only t12 bulbs

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.620 
you can see it says use only t12 bulbs
so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:55.700> guess<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.479> they're

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so I guess they don't know what they're

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.630 
so I guess they don't know what they're
talking<00:01:58.020> about<00:01:58.100> um<00:01:59.540> here<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.140> sockets

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
talking about um here are the sockets

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.920 
talking about um here are the sockets
before<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> bulbs<00:02:03.180> they're<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> holders

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
before the bulbs they're the holders

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.950 
before the bulbs they're the holders
whatever<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.009> call<00:02:05.159> them

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
whatever you would like to call them

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.979 
whatever you would like to call them
they're<00:02:07.250> pretty<00:02:08.250> decent<00:02:08.910> quality<00:02:09.450> because

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they're pretty decent quality because

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.100 
they're pretty decent quality because
they<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> lock<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.730> place<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.480> middle

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
they kind of lock in place this middle

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.220 
they kind of lock in place this middle
part<00:02:13.319> turn

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
part turn

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.020 
part turn
which<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.410> kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.740> think<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.460> nice<00:02:17.730> feature

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
which I kind of think is a nice feature

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.260 
which I kind of think is a nice feature
here's<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.050> quick<00:02:19.380> view<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> ballast<00:02:20.370> as

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
here's a quick view of the ballast as

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.360 
here's a quick view of the ballast as
you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:27.000> use<00:02:27.450> two<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.440> 32<00:02:28.920> t8

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can see it can use two of 32 t8

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:40.490 
you can see it can use two of 32 t8
bulbs<00:02:29.810> or<00:02:30.890> any<00:02:31.890> t12<00:02:32.790> bulb<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
bulbs or any t12 bulb so there is the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.360 
bulbs or any t12 bulb so there is the
ballast<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.550> back<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> fixture<00:02:43.370> now

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
ballast as the back of the fixture now

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.210 
ballast as the back of the fixture now
the<00:02:44.430> cord<00:02:45.330> comes<00:02:45.780> off<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the cord comes off of the back so you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.940 
the cord comes off of the back so you
can't<00:02:47.610> flush<00:02:48.060> mount<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> ceiling<00:02:49.740> if

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950

pre-drilled<00:03:04.020> hole<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.620> would<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
pre-drilled hole if you would like to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.000 
pre-drilled hole if you would like to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
put in a longer ballast which I like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.070 
put in a longer ballast which I like
when<00:03:08.310> they<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.850> on<00:03:09.120> shop<00:03:09.420> lights<00:03:09.690> because

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
when they do that on shop lights because

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.990 
when they do that on shop lights because
usually<00:03:10.320> these<00:03:10.800> ballasts<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.489> they<00:03:11.640> put<00:03:11.880> in

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
usually these ballasts that they put in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.140 
usually these ballasts that they put in
them<00:03:12.209> don't<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.440> last<00:03:13.680> very<00:03:14.010> long<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.520> if

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
them don't really last very long or if

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.710 
them don't really last very long or if
you<00:03:15.330> treat<00:03:15.780> them<00:03:15.959> fine<00:03:16.820> then<00:03:17.820> they<00:03:18.090> might<00:03:18.420> last

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you treat them fine then they might last

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.600 
you treat them fine then they might last
a<00:03:18.959> bit<00:03:18.989> longer

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
a bit longer

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.509 
a bit longer
but<00:03:20.610> anyway<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.510> designers<00:03:22.110> edge<00:03:22.410> makes<00:03:23.250> a

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
but anyway the designers edge makes a

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.229 
but anyway the designers edge makes a
fixture<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.299> looks<00:03:24.660> exactly<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
