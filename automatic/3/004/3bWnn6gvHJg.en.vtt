00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.789
 already in my last year of youth and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 I think the u since I was little has 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.610
 given everything then all I have left 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.610
 is to deliver everything 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.460
 Hello 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.260
 if it has been a very varied year but they are 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.040
 stages that in all is pulled out something 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.600
 to learn 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.160
 and we must continue taking advantage every time 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 that you know the opportunity to play and in 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.000
 wherever it is, there are four parties that 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.960
 compared to last year and in the year 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.180
 they were two 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.180
 and play an international match I think 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.000
 that will help a lot in what I 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.620
 I think that every player dreams is the most 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.769
 nice to play a world cup represent 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 country and that's the nicest thing to represent 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.260
 to all the people who will be supporting 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.640
 and enjoying warn and so it's pretty 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.640
 diverse of various clubs 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.899

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.549

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.560

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.490

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.890

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.960
