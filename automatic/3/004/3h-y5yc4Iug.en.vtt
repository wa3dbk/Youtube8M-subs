00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
degrees and then this slides right in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.270 
degrees and then this slides right in
here

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.140 

okay<00:01:36.910> not<00:01:37.450> much<00:01:37.720> room<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.020> move<00:01:38.940> make<00:01:39.940> sure

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
okay not much room to move make sure

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.240 
okay not much room to move make sure
that<00:01:40.480> because<00:01:40.780> if<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.320> had<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> moving<00:01:41.920> needle

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
that because if you had a moving needle

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.250 
that because if you had a moving needle
and<00:01:42.730> it's<00:01:43.000> going<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.330> all<00:01:43.570> over<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> place

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
and it's going to be all over the place

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.930 
and it's going to be all over the place
and<00:01:44.650> you're<00:01:44.979> not<00:01:45.040> going<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.370> have<00:01:45.490> straighter

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
and you're not going to have straighter

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.580 
and you're not going to have straighter
lines<00:01:46.270> even<00:01:46.660> if<00:01:46.900> you're<00:01:47.110> good<00:01:47.470> hand

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
lines even if you're good hand

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.109 
lines even if you're good hand

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
don't work for some reason they don't

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.479 
don't work for some reason they don't
melt<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.630> these<00:02:13.959> ones<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.500> um

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
melt like these ones do um

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.030 
melt like these ones do um
these<00:02:15.790> when<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.810> melt<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.650> don't<00:02:17.830> want<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
these when you melt it you don't want to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.890 
these when you melt it you don't want to
get<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.280> too<00:02:18.459> hot<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.030> there<00:02:19.180> L<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.660> just

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
get it too hot so there L so they just

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.229 
get it too hot so there L so they just
drip<00:02:20.860> or<00:02:21.220> whatever<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.330> know<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:25.030> tell

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
drip or whatever you know you can tell

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.199 
drip or whatever you know you can tell
when<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.260> stretch<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:27.150> instead<00:02:28.150> of

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
when you stretch it that instead of

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.040 
when you stretch it that instead of
being<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.110> color<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
being like that color like kind of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.790 
being like that color like kind of
see-through<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.739> glazed<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.730> guess<00:02:33.989> um<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.739> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
see-through but glazed I guess um it a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.460 
see-through but glazed I guess um it a
turn<00:02:36.280> clear<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.120> that's<00:02:37.420> perfect<00:02:38.050> time<00:02:38.260> to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
turn clear and that's perfect time to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.840 
turn clear and that's perfect time to
pull<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.040> stretch<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.730> into<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.299> little

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
pull it and stretch it into this little

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.610 
pull it and stretch it into this little
little<00:02:42.850> point<00:02:43.150> there<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.260> cut<00:02:44.470> it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
little point there and then you cut it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.810 
little point there and then you cut it
off<00:02:46.709> another<00:02:47.709> part<00:02:48.040> top<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> pen<00:02:50.820> just

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
off another part top of the pen just

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.850 
off another part top of the pen just
take<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.360> cut<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.780> off<00:02:52.930> right<00:02:53.170> there<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
take that cut it off right there at the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.420 
take that cut it off right there at the
little<00:02:54.220> lip<00:02:54.489> there<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.260> then<00:02:56.260> bend<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.070> into<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
little lip there and then bend it into a

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.580 
little lip there and then bend it into a
ninety<00:02:57.760> degree<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.019> where<00:02:59.170> your<00:02:59.320> motor

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
ninety degree this is where your motor

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.039 
ninety degree this is where your motor
is<00:02:59.709> going<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.100> sitting<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:01.049> then

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
is going to be sitting right here then

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.880 
is going to be sitting right here then

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.940 
like they turn it on put it down in the
ink<00:04:58.599> and<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.470> suck<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.220> up<00:05:00.340> by<00:05:00.610> itself<00:05:01.950> that's

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
ink and it a suck it up by itself that's

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.250 
ink and it a suck it up by itself that's
what<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.190> do<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.789> guess<00:05:04.360> if<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.720> want<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.020> try<00:05:05.200> to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
what I do I guess if you want to try to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.159 
what I do I guess if you want to try to
fill<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.800> or<00:05:05.919> whatever<00:05:06.099> and<00:05:06.639> go<00:05:07.389> right<00:05:07.599> ahead<00:05:07.750> I

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
fill it or whatever and go right ahead I

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.379 
fill it or whatever and go right ahead I
think<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.250> would<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.400> spit<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.970> out

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
think it would just spit it out

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.440 
think it would just spit it out
