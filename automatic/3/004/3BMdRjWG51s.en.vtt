00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 welcome back after all the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 requests that this video has had me 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.440
 has sent messages asking me then 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.150
 what books should they read to begin with? 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.469
 to read English to be able to read 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.469
 a complex novel 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.320
 I personally learned English from 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.270
 way that I learned Spanish so my 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.340
 case is not exemplary that I can not give 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.390
 tips on how to learn English not 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.770
 you would have to ask my 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 teachers who did it because I 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.800
 I really do not know I do not remember a 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.960
 process I think we should start 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.029
 Sincerely for getting used to reading 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.040
 english in a simple way those books 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.920
 that at school they send you typical of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.120
 oxford cambridge whatever of these that 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 are adapted are classics of the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
 literature and adapts what is a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.530
 good way to start before 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.360
 launch a mini break and it is still 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.309
 a novel without adapting that option 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.629
 It is always there also do not have the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.159
 total words I think it's a 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.930
 good way to also start this 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.610
 reading process that will apply the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.769
 complementary process that is to see 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.299
 cinema see would be to say with subtitles in 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.710
 English so that you associate the sound 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.809
 the way it is written with the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.979
 meaning that has more visual and then 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.420
 that also helps you in reading 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.519
 because you know how to write how 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.600
 sounds and already associates that action took 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.610
 a word that you when you are reading 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 you do not know what it means first you have to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.970
 try to get it out of context and if not 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.729
 Well, probably one was written 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.070
 it would be a movie I would not resort to 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.659
 dictionary to I do not know that out of extreme 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.540
 need I think it seems like a 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.310
 tool 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.110
 of reading and learning always 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.060
 that having it there we will try to take 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.680
 logic that means knowing what is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.630
 happening in the situation if it's a 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 word of sadam could be your 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.510
 skillful blessing because it 's a very page 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.060
 useful in explaining you from 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.550
 abbreviations to the old or the modern and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.900
 it explains all various definitions 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.460
 because it does not always mean the same thing is 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.110
 a useful tool to read that 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.820
 type of books to be adapted would happen 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.710
 with honey green without honey gray 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.150
 contemporary the fantastic would leave for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.620
 there more advanced and break 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.780
 contemporary help in the sense that 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.310
 as they are things that you live and know and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.920
 you've met and others are so strange 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.590
 and you feel more comfortable from sagas like 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.759
 I do not even with are princess diaries I think 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.960
 that help a lot because they are 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.030
 contemporary and they do not stop being 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.440
 fun and threats happened to him at mid 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.150
 the goal and fantastic because as the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.770
 fantastic terminology is always 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.270
 different then you do not always have to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.920
 know how they pronounce themselves by certain 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.420
 words later would you go would a guy perez 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.040
 and an aunt susana colony and network 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.110
 contemporary would happen united serious 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.940
 fantastic of the remembered type and there and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.040
 then I would start mixing an earl to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.900
 prevent more complex like esther pÃ©rez 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
 say web flower and a miguel great more 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.020
 complex also after leaving 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.880
 contemporary complex as it can be 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.650
 man I would not say 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.630
 because I think it uses a lot is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940
 I think it's a pretty novel 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.440
 simple to be packaged at 90 there 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.600
 many fewer phrases made many 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.360
 expressions I want to open without 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590
 utilization but those more metaphors do not 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.390
 it means that man is super 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.670
 ipanema complex but I think so 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.320
 you have to have enough more bases and for 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.600
 last you throw yourself at the fantastic you 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.580
 you throw to read red throwing any 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.470
 novel that this may occur as a youth 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.930
 that you feel like I think you already have a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 base sufficiently entrenched after 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.990
 of these progressive steps as for 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.690
 launch yourself to read some classic no 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.580
 adapted I will handle more types of 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.960
 narration and I think you can already throw 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.370
 to read any novel but good 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.660
 blocks there are always contemporaries in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.760
 some way to start so that we 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 discourage and a progression the books of 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 px I think they are pretty simple 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.700
 they are less metaphorical than the best of 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.380
 gringa television that these have been my 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 little tips I do not know if they will be very 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.710
 useful but yes and I hope that I have 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.630
 liked the video see you in the next 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.240
 and be good both 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.550
