well Steve all the fish hawk models this
year<00:00:28.960> have<00:00:29.230> got<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.529> new<00:00:29.740> console<00:00:30.310> what<00:00:31.150> did

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
year have got this new console what did

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.790 
year have got this new console what did
you<00:00:31.390> guys<00:00:31.510> have<00:00:31.779> in<00:00:31.930> mind<00:00:32.169> when<00:00:32.349> you<00:00:32.439> design

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
you guys have in mind when you design

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.770 
you guys have in mind when you design
the<00:00:32.949> shape<00:00:33.129> of<00:00:33.309> this<00:00:33.489> what<00:00:34.210> we<00:00:34.329> were<00:00:34.449> trying<00:00:34.719> to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
the shape of this what we were trying to

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.029 
the shape of this what we were trying to
achieve<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.410> plenty<00:00:35.770> of<00:00:35.800> room<00:00:35.980> for

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
achieve is plenty of room for

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.369 
achieve is plenty of room for
electronics<00:00:36.820> we<00:00:37.390> still<00:00:37.629> have<00:00:37.839> room<00:00:38.050> for<00:00:38.079> the

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
electronics we still have room for the

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.250 
electronics we still have room for the
smaller<00:00:38.649> electronics<00:00:39.309> on<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:40.390> side<00:00:40.690> but<00:00:41.109> what

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
smaller electronics on the side but what

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.619 
smaller electronics on the side but what
we<00:00:41.409> added<00:00:41.620> was<00:00:41.979> a<00:00:42.280> platform<00:00:42.729> to<00:00:43.149> mount<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.420> rail

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
we added was a platform to mount a rail

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.509 
we added was a platform to mount a rail
mount<00:00:43.960> which<00:00:44.440> would<00:00:44.620> bring<00:00:44.800> your<00:00:45.010> larger

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
mount which would bring your larger

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.520 
mount which would bring your larger
electronics<00:00:46.120> right<00:00:46.539> in<00:00:46.749> in<00:00:47.139> front<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.469> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
electronics right in in front of the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.009 
electronics right in in front of the
driver<00:00:47.769> now<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:48.789> material<00:00:49.030> here<00:00:49.539> has<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:49.749> nice

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
driver now the material here has a nice

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.989 
driver now the material here has a nice
texture<00:00:50.559> but<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:50.829> also<00:00:50.949> seems<00:00:51.339> really<00:00:51.729> tough

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
texture but it also seems really tough

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.539 
texture but it also seems really tough

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
little narrow but it beats sitting on

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860 
little narrow but it beats sitting on
the<00:01:19.660> fishing<00:01:20.020> deck<00:01:20.230> and<00:01:20.560> it's<00:01:21.340> very<00:01:21.520> easy<00:01:21.870> to
