00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
here has these like nice sides around it

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.259 
here has these like nice sides around it
and<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.779> flat<00:00:29.050> anterior<00:00:29.679> surface<00:00:30.240> what's<00:00:31.240> a

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
and a flat anterior surface what's a

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.369 
and a flat anterior surface what's a
little<00:00:31.390> different<00:00:31.480> about<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:32.020> one<00:00:32.230> though

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
little different about this one though

be on an even keel and a button is gonna
tilt<00:00:47.320> your<00:00:47.649> resin<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.190> gonna<00:00:48.399> spill<00:00:48.730> out<00:00:48.969> and

the<00:01:38.530> surface<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.160> box<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.730> then<00:01:40.450> what

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
the surface of the box and then what

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.970 
the surface of the box and then what
you've<00:01:40.690> done<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.170> you've<00:01:41.290> created<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.710> little

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
you've done is you've created a little

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.530 
you've done is you've created a little
cavity<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.330> can<00:01:43.510> put<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.850> button<00:01:46.090> into

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
cavity that you can put your button into

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.230 
cavity that you can put your button into
and<00:01:46.780> suddenly<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.920> have<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.370> nice<00:01:48.640> flat

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
and suddenly you have a nice flat

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440 
and suddenly you have a nice flat
surface<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.900> pour<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.440> resin<00:01:50.590> into<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.970> for

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
surface to pour the resin into now for

surface to pour the resin into now for
these<00:01:52.840> objects<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.650> have<00:01:53.920> no<00:01:54.490> bezel<00:01:54.940> here's

this is Jason's tip and what he says to
do<00:02:02.110> go<00:02:03.040> ahead<00:02:03.280> push<00:02:04.120> the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
do go ahead push the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.810 
do go ahead push the
pushpin<00:02:04.910> into<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.810> cardboard<00:02:06.050> box<00:02:06.790> apply<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
pushpin into the cardboard box apply a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.609 
pushpin into the cardboard box apply a
little<00:02:08.179> bit<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.390> crafters<00:02:08.960> pick<00:02:08.990> glue<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
little bit of crafters pick glue to the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.900 
little bit of crafters pick glue to the
top<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.900> and<00:02:11.900> then<00:02:12.110> just<00:02:12.800> rest<00:02:13.100> your<00:02:13.370> object

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
top of it and then just rest your object

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
top of it and then just rest your object
on<00:02:14.030> top<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.870> reason<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.230> want<00:02:15.320> to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
on top and the reason you want to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.930 
on top and the reason you want to
elevate<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.160> because<00:02:16.460> we're<00:02:16.640> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> be

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
elevate it is because we're going to be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.960 
elevate it is because we're going to be
relying<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.510> surface<00:02:18.080> tension<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:19.340> keep<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
relying on surface tension to keep the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.220 
relying on surface tension to keep the
resin<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.420> place<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> keep<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.140> from

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
resin in place and to keep it from

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.310 
resin in place and to keep it from
spilling<00:02:21.650> over<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.890> edge<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:24.080> this

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
spilling over the edge you can do this

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.440 
spilling over the edge you can do this
with<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.890> flat<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.640> surface<00:02:25.820> like<00:02:26.209> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
with it flat on the surface like that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720 
with it flat on the surface like that
but<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.959> find<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.680> works<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.250> little<00:02:28.459> bit

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
but I find it just works a little bit

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.060 
but I find it just works a little bit
better<00:02:28.940> when<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:29.870> raised<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.860> prefer

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
better when it's raised up so I prefer

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.140 
better when it's raised up so I prefer
to<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.610> way

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to do it that way

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.290 
to do it that way

flipped it over set it down on some
collage<00:03:02.300> paper<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.989> let<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.290> dry<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.770> then

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
collage paper and let it dry I then

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.850 
collage paper and let it dry I then
trimmed<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.390> collage<00:03:05.690> paper<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.709> was

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
trimmed the collage paper so it was

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.860 
trimmed the collage paper so it was
right<00:03:07.130> up<00:03:07.340> against<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> edge<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.300> my<00:03:08.420> stamping

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
right up against the edge of my stamping

blank put a little dab of glue on top of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.490 
blank put a little dab of glue on top of
this<00:03:12.019> pushpin<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.940> set<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.299> down<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.200> and

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
this pushpin and set it down like so and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.920 
this pushpin and set it down like so and
then<00:03:16.280> once<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.640> was<00:03:16.940> done<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.360> went<00:03:17.630> ahead<00:03:17.720> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
then once that was done I went ahead and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.280 
then once that was done I went ahead and
I<00:03:18.200> coated<00:03:18.590> my<00:03:19.360> paper<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.660> did<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.930> with<00:03:21.080> my

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
I coated my paper and I did that with my

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.020 
I coated my paper and I did that with my
buttons<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.400> also<00:03:22.549> did<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:22.940> these

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
buttons and I also did it with these

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.390 
buttons and I also did it with these
little<00:03:23.239> flat<00:03:23.630> stamping<00:03:24.260> blanks<00:03:24.590> as<00:03:24.739> well<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
little flat stamping blanks as well and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400 
little flat stamping blanks as well and
I<00:03:25.730> used<00:03:26.060> three<00:03:26.480> coats<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> Nunn<00:03:27.380> design

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
I used three coats of Nunn design

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.160 
I used three coats of Nunn design
sealant<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:29.060> made<00:03:29.239> sure<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.450> coated<00:03:29.840> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
sealant and I made sure I coated the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.440 
sealant and I made sure I coated the
edges<00:03:30.739> as<00:03:30.950> well<00:03:31.250> as<00:03:31.519> real<00:03:31.760> importantly<00:03:32.090> use<00:03:32.269> of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
edges as well as real importantly use of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810 
edges as well as real importantly use of
three<00:03:32.630> coats<00:03:32.840> all<00:03:33.799> right<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.280> without<00:03:34.489> further

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
three coats all right so without further

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.670 
three coats all right so without further

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
mixed up a batch of ice resin equal

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.830 
mixed up a batch of ice resin equal
parts<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.890> you'll<00:03:40.850> see<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.269> I'm<00:03:41.450> not<00:03:41.630> going

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
parts and you'll see that I'm not going

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.720 
parts and you'll see that I'm not going
to<00:03:41.989> use<00:03:42.260> all<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:42.890> resin<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:43.519> this

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
to use all of this resin in this

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
to use all of this resin in this
particular<00:03:44.209> video<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:45.110> another

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
particular video so I do have another

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.770 
particular video so I do have another
project<00:03:45.769> in<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.880> background<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.510> I'll<00:03:47.600> use

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
project in the background that I'll use

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.830 
project in the background that I'll use
my<00:03:48.620> leftover<00:03:49.070> resin<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:49.640> I'm<00:03:50.450> going<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.690> pick

my leftover resin for I'm going to pick

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.259 
my leftover resin for I'm going to pick
up<00:03:50.959> some<00:03:51.200> resin<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:51.739> my<00:03:52.220> popsicle<00:03:52.730> stick<00:03:52.970> which

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
up some resin on my popsicle stick which

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.820 
up some resin on my popsicle stick which
was<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.600> stir<00:03:53.840> stick

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
was my stir stick

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.750 
was my stir stick
and<00:03:54.920> I'm<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:55.490> going<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.820> carefully<00:03:57.580> drip<00:03:58.580> it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
and I'm just going to carefully drip it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.430 
and I'm just going to carefully drip it
in<00:03:58.880> little<00:03:59.660> by<00:03:59.870> little<00:04:00.140> into<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.160> center<00:04:01.700> of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
in little by little into the center of

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.930 
in little by little into the center of
the<00:04:03.440> button<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.370> can<00:04:04.520> see<00:04:04.670> it's<00:04:04.760> going<00:04:04.880> to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
the button and you can see it's going to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:18.470 
the button and you can see it's going to
spread<00:04:05.240> out<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.660> edges

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.880 

you're<00:04:19.050> not<00:04:19.170> gonna<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.350> able<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.620> me<00:04:19.740> doing

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
you're not gonna be able to see me doing

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.230 
you're not gonna be able to see me doing
this<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.310> gonna<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:20.640> go<00:04:20.850> ahead<00:04:21.060> and

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
this but I'm gonna actually go ahead and

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.780 
this but I'm gonna actually go ahead and
hunker<00:04:21.870> down<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.110> look<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.770> from<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.580> way

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
hunker down and look at it from this way

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.240 
hunker down and look at it from this way
so<00:04:23.850> I'm<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.390> level<00:04:24.810> with<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.800> see<00:04:25.950> if<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.100> need

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so I'm I level with it to see if I need

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.570 
so I'm I level with it to see if I need
to<00:04:26.370> add<00:04:26.490> more<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.200> looks<00:04:31.410> pretty<00:04:31.650> even<00:04:32.220> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
to add more so that looks pretty even to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.790 
to add more so that looks pretty even to
me<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.730> do<00:04:32.970> want<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.300> create<00:04:33.450> just<00:04:33.720> an<00:04:33.930> ever<00:04:34.200> so

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
me I do want to create just an ever so

me I do want to create just an ever so
slight<00:04:34.830> dome<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.760> I'm<00:04:35.820> just<00:04:35.910> going<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.120> add<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
slight dome so I'm just going to add a

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.270 
slight dome so I'm just going to add a
little<00:04:36.480> bit<00:04:36.570> more<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.740> now<00:04:37.920> I'm<00:04:38.010> going<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.160> go

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
little bit more and now I'm going to go

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.900 
little bit more and now I'm going to go
to<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:38.490> next<00:04:38.550> one<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.150> do<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.450> same

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.270 

if<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:46.720> see<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.230> is<00:04:47.260> sliding<00:04:47.860> too<00:04:48.100> much

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
if you see that it is sliding too much

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.690 
if you see that it is sliding too much
to<00:04:48.520> one<00:04:48.730> side<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:50.800> ahead<00:04:51.010> rotate<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.670> little

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
to one side go ahead rotate it a little

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.080 
to one side go ahead rotate it a little
bit<00:04:52.210> without<00:04:53.110> touching<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.710> resin<00:04:54.100> just<00:04:55.000> to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
bit without touching the resin just to

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.070 
bit without touching the resin just to
make<00:04:55.210> sure<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.480> is<00:04:55.630> completely<00:04:56.380> level<00:04:58.080> can

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
make sure it is completely level can

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.570 
make sure it is completely level can
take<00:04:59.290> a<00:04:59.320> little<00:04:59.620> finessing<00:04:59.980> but<00:05:00.310> you'll<00:05:00.430> get

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
take a little finessing but you'll get

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.650 
take a little finessing but you'll get
it<00:05:02.790> just<00:05:03.790> add<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.390> little<00:05:04.930> bit<00:05:05.140> more

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.200 

and<00:05:08.750> one<00:05:09.500> tip<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:10.010> you<00:05:10.250> have<00:05:10.280> bezel<00:05:10.820> shapes

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
and one tip if you have bezel shapes

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.530 
and one tip if you have bezel shapes
like<00:05:11.480> these<00:05:11.720> these<00:05:12.140> are<00:05:12.320> Nunn<00:05:12.560> design<00:05:12.590> buttons

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
like these these are Nunn design buttons

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.480 
like these these are Nunn design buttons
and<00:05:14.590> you'll<00:05:15.590> see<00:05:15.770> they're<00:05:15.920> not<00:05:16.100> really<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
and you'll see they're not really the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.980 
and you'll see they're not really the
size<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:16.940> traditional<00:05:17.120> hole<00:05:17.600> punch<00:05:17.840> or

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
size of a traditional hole punch or

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.740 
size of a traditional hole punch or
anything<00:05:18.140> if<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.890> put<00:05:19.130> these<00:05:19.310> down<00:05:19.670> on<00:05:20.000> a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
anything if you put these down on a

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.570 
anything if you put these down on a
copier<00:05:22.120> like<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.420> bezel<00:05:24.410> side<00:05:24.770> down<00:05:25.040> make<00:05:25.550> a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
copier like this bezel side down make a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.480 
copier like this bezel side down make a
copy<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.660> can<00:05:26.900> then<00:05:27.080> go<00:05:27.290> ahead<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.620> cut<00:05:28.220> out

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
copy you can then go ahead and cut out

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.000 
copy you can then go ahead and cut out
the<00:05:29.060> imprint<00:05:29.480> that<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.810> makes<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.350> that<00:05:30.830> you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
the imprint that it makes and that you

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.620 
the imprint that it makes and that you
can<00:05:31.190> use<00:05:31.280> as<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> template<00:05:31.910> for<00:05:31.970> cutting<00:05:32.540> out

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
can use as a template for cutting out

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.100 
can use as a template for cutting out
your<00:05:32.660> shapes<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.580> quick<00:05:34.580> tip<00:05:34.790> all<00:05:35.660> right<00:05:35.720> now
