00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.140 
and hopefully real awesome chuck key for
the<00:00:09.719> Chuck<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.920> late<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> did<00:00:12.000> get

the Chuck on this late now I did get

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.490 
the Chuck on this late now I did get
kind<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.630> tired<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.960> messing<00:00:13.110> around<00:00:13.290> with

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
kind of tired of messing around with

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680 
kind of tired of messing around with
that<00:00:13.620> four<00:00:13.889> jaw<00:00:14.099> Chuck<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> picked<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.509> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that four jaw Chuck so I picked up this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.310 
that four jaw Chuck so I picked up this
he<00:00:15.839> used<00:00:16.049> three<00:00:16.379> jaw<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.830> ebay<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.119> those

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
he used three jaw off ebay and for those

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.730 
he used three jaw off ebay and for those
without<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.740> decades<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.789> masterful

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
without my decades of masterful

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
without my decades of masterful
machining<00:00:22.740> experience<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.760> means<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
machining experience what that means is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.259 
machining experience what that means is
that<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> three-jaw<00:00:25.890> chuck<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.490> three<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that with a three-jaw chuck all three of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
that with a three-jaw chuck all three of
these<00:00:27.480> jaws<00:00:27.779> tighten<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.529> turn<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
these jaws tighten when you turn one of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.609 
these jaws tighten when you turn one of
these<00:00:29.730> little<00:00:29.970> knob<00:00:30.480> things<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
these little knob things here so it's a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.549 
these little knob things here so it's a
lot<00:00:31.800> faster<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.809> toss<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:34.050> pieces<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.440> work

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
lot faster to toss up pieces of work

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
lot faster to toss up pieces of work
like<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:36.000> i'm<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
like this one that i'm going to be

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
like this one that i'm going to be
turning<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.260> bearings<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.920> some

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
turning into some bearings or some

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
turning into some bearings or some
bushings<00:00:38.460> rather<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.510> barbecue<00:00:40.079> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
bushings rather for that barbecue so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
bushings rather for that barbecue so
anyway<00:00:41.070> yeah<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.059> pretty<00:00:42.180> thrilled<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
anyway yeah I'm pretty thrilled to have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.560 
anyway yeah I'm pretty thrilled to have
this<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.940> chuck<00:00:45.180> key<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this but this is the the chuck key that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
this but this is the the chuck key that
came<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
came with it and it's really not that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
came with it and it's really not that
great<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.090> can't<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> most<00:00:49.050> leverage<00:00:49.350> on

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
great you can't get the most leverage on

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
great you can't get the most leverage on
it<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> most<00:00:50.460> comfortable<00:00:50.670> thing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it it's not the most comfortable thing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
it it's not the most comfortable thing
in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> world<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.800> we're

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
in the world to use and so what we're

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
in the world to use and so what we're
going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.730> creating<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.629> larger

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
going to be doing is creating a larger

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
going to be doing is creating a larger
version<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.510> my

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
version of this right here which some my

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
version of this right here which some my
viewers<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.739> remember<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> couple

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
viewers will remember from a couple

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
viewers will remember from a couple
years<00:01:00.090> ago<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> made<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.050> drill<00:01:01.440> press

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
years ago I made it for my drill press

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
years ago I made it for my drill press
here<00:01:01.890> still<00:01:02.550> working<00:01:02.850> great<00:01:03.090> no<00:01:03.359> regrets

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
here still working great no regrets

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
here still working great no regrets
about<00:01:03.840> doing<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> there's<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> couple

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
about doing this there's just a couple

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
about doing this there's just a couple
things<00:01:05.729> I'd<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.060> differently<00:01:06.380> mainly<00:01:07.380> I'd

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
things I'd do differently mainly I'd

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
things I'd do differently mainly I'd
take<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> open<00:01:08.369> end<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> wrench<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> put

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
take that open end of the wrench and put

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
take that open end of the wrench and put
that<00:01:09.510> where<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.990> over<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> chuck<00:01:10.830> part<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that where they over the chuck part is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
that where they over the chuck part is
where<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> chuck<00:01:12.240> key<00:01:12.420> part<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
where the chuck key part is so that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710 
where the chuck key part is so that
doesn't<00:01:13.500> jab<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.860> hand<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.490> oh<00:01:15.270> yeah<00:01:15.479> one

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
other thing if you're going to do this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.620 
other thing if you're going to do this

what you're more than welcome to do if
possible<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> recommend<00:01:21.840> trying<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> find<00:01:22.439> one

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
possible I recommend trying to find one

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.050 
possible I recommend trying to find one
of<00:01:22.680> these<00:01:22.799> twisted<00:01:23.369> wrenches<00:01:23.850> because

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of these twisted wrenches because

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.480 
of these twisted wrenches because
they're<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:24.450> ergonomic

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
they're a lot more ergonomic

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
they're a lot more ergonomic
unfortunately<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> needed<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> 13<00:01:27.630> 16<00:01:27.990> trench

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
unfortunately I needed a 13 16 trench

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.560 
unfortunately I needed a 13 16 trench
for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.520> key<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.000> thing<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> they

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
for the the key on this thing and they

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.210 
for the the key on this thing and they
didn't<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> twist<00:01:31.470> wrenches<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> side

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
didn't have the twist wrenches that side

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
didn't have the twist wrenches that side
so<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.820> getting<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> their<00:01:33.750> thumb

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so i just got getting out of their thumb

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.249 
so i just got getting out of their thumb
yeah<00:01:34.650> i<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.610> instead<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.079> what

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
yeah i got this one instead and so what

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.980 
yeah i got this one instead and so what
we're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.780> going

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
we're going to do is we are just going

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.370 
we're going to do is we are just going
to<00:01:40.340> take<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> open<00:01:41.790> part<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> basically<00:01:43.110> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to take the open part and basically just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039 
to take the open part and basically just
weld<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.700> such<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.659> being

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
weld it on there like such well being

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.340 
weld it on there like such well being
extremely<00:01:46.799> careful<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.390> breathe<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.990> any

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
extremely careful to not breathe in any

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.020 
extremely careful to not breathe in any
of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> crap<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.040> comes<00:01:50.280> off<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.759> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of the crap that comes off of this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
of the crap that comes off of this
because<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> like

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because this is some kind of like

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
because this is some kind of like
chromium<00:01:52.920> coating<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> it'll<00:01:54.420> probably<00:01:54.600> kill

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
chromium coating and it'll probably kill

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
chromium coating and it'll probably kill
you<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> breathe<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> enough<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you if you breathe in enough of it and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
you if you breathe in enough of it and
if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> breathe<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
if you breathe in a little bit it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.359 
if you breathe in a little bit it's
definitely<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.710> any<00:01:58.950> wonders

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
definitely not going to do any wonders

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.160 
definitely not going to do any wonders
and<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.360> really<00:02:00.600> careful<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and so I'm going to be really careful to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.010 
and so I'm going to be really careful to
not<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
not do that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
not do that
alright<00:02:04.020> youtube<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.040> wrench<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.580> cooled

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
alright youtube so the wrench is cooled

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
alright youtube so the wrench is cooled
and<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.630> take<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> look<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:07.620> we

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and now we can take a look at what we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.890 
and now we can take a look at what we
have<00:02:08.130> here<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.210> one<00:02:09.420> looks<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.750> little

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
have here now this one looks a little

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.780 
have here now this one looks a little
bit<00:02:10.080> different<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.680> last<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.220> mainly

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
bit different than the last one mainly

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.910 
bit different than the last one mainly
because<00:02:11.940> i<00:02:12.120> left<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.110> t-handle<00:02:13.680> thing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
because i left the out of t-handle thing

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.510 
because i left the out of t-handle thing
on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> doohickey<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.770> where<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.280> other

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
on the doohickey and where is the other

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970 
on the doohickey and where is the other
one<00:02:17.670> i<00:02:18.240> made<00:02:18.270> well<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.080> all<00:02:19.200> thought<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.500> just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
one i made well you all thought it just

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.670 
one i made well you all thought it just
this<00:02:20.730> handle<00:02:21.210> was<00:02:21.300> no<00:02:21.450> longer<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
this handle was no longer there but the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
this handle was no longer there but the
thing<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.280> drill<00:02:23.610> press<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.270> can

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
thing is this drill press is you can

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.600 
thing is this drill press is you can
imagine<00:02:24.600> requires<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.320> lot<00:02:25.650> less<00:02:25.920> torque<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
imagine requires a lot less torque to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.120 
imagine requires a lot less torque to
tighten<00:02:27.300> down<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:27.840> whatever<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.770> this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
tighten down a bit or whatever then this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.840 
tighten down a bit or whatever then this
chuck<00:02:29.460> does<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.710> I've<00:02:32.100> had<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
chuck does and you know I've had the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.970 
chuck does and you know I've had the
Chuck<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.810> kind<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.260> slip<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.650> little<00:02:34.680> bit

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
Chuck on that kind of slip a little bit

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
Chuck on that kind of slip a little bit
as<00:02:35.100> I'm<00:02:35.220> cranking<00:02:35.580> down<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.690> when<00:02:36.810> I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
as I'm cranking down on it so when I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.080 
as I'm cranking down on it so when I
made<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> wanted<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.550> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
made this one what I wanted to do is to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.970 
made this one what I wanted to do is to
leave<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.470> could<00:02:40.560> hold<00:02:40.830> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
leave that on there so I could hold it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.400 
leave that on there so I could hold it
like<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.760> nice<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.600> secure<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.200> then

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
like this all nice and secure and then

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
like this all nice and secure and then
torque<00:02:43.710> down<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.520> part<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.910> wrench

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
torque down on that part of the wrench

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.530 
torque down on that part of the wrench
so<00:02:45.930> um<00:02:46.230> yeah<00:02:46.890> hopefully<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.550> works<00:02:47.760> also<00:02:48.150> as

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
so um yeah hopefully that works also as

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.050 
so um yeah hopefully that works also as
you<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.810> see<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:48.990> angled<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.220> way<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:51.000> case

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you can see I angled it that way in case

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.660 
you can see I angled it that way in case
I<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> tight<00:02:53.190> spot<00:02:53.460> or

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
I have to get in to like a tight spot or

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.730 
I have to get in to like a tight spot or
whatever<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.260> going<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.440> be<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> lot

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
whatever you know it's going to be a lot

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.110 
whatever you know it's going to be a lot
easier<00:02:55.770> than<00:02:56.250> having<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.670> wrench<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
easier than having that wrench at a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.850 
easier than having that wrench at a
90-degree<00:02:57.690> angle<00:02:57.720> because<00:02:58.440> then<00:02:58.710> these

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
90-degree angle because then these

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.900 
90-degree angle because then these
things<00:02:59.070> are<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.520> bumping<00:02:59.820> into

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
things are going to be bumping into

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.550 
things are going to be bumping into
stuff<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.510> don't<00:03:00.930> know<00:03:00.990> if<00:03:01.080> that'll<00:03:01.230> make<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.470> big

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
stuff I don't know if that'll make a big

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.200 
stuff I don't know if that'll make a big
difference<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.580> it's<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
difference or not but it's it's

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.270 
difference or not but it's it's
something<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> definitely<00:03:04.770> thought

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
something that I definitely thought

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.850 
something that I definitely thought
about<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.760> considered<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:07.200> also<00:03:07.380> angled

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
about and considered and I also angled

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.800 
about and considered and I also angled
it<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.790> was<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.330> much<00:03:09.510> just

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it like that that was pretty much just

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.280 
it like that that was pretty much just
an<00:03:10.260> impulsive<00:03:10.730> deal<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.120> based<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.570> implied

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
an impulsive deal just based on implied

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.199 
an impulsive deal just based on implied
comfort<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.130> hopefully<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.850> works<00:03:14.970> out

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
comfort and hopefully that works out

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.060 
comfort and hopefully that works out
pretty<00:03:15.390> well<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.440> got<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.620> tell<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.950> guys

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
I'm pretty excited so far with how this

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.140 
I'm pretty excited so far with how this
looks<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.220> I'm<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.520> actually<00:03:20.730> going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.060> know

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
looks but I'm not actually going to know

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.670 
looks but I'm not actually going to know
what<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.300> think<00:03:21.510> about<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.900> until<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.380> try<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
what I think about it until we try it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.910 
what I think about it until we try it
out

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:44.520

as<00:03:52.900> i<00:03:53.050> did<00:03:53.350> before<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:54.040> really<00:03:54.370> easy<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.670> hold

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
as i did before it's really easy to hold

as i did before it's really easy to hold
this<00:03:55.060> thing<00:03:55.300> down<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.020> actual<00:03:56.319> doohickey

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
this thing down on the actual doohickey

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.400 
this thing down on the actual doohickey
on<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:58.360> thingamajigger<00:03:58.990> here<00:03:59.260> without

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
on the the thingamajigger here without

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.050 
on the the thingamajigger here without
it<00:03:59.680> slipping<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.130> sliding<00:04:00.340> everywhere<00:04:00.610> which

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
it slipping and sliding everywhere which

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.390 
it slipping and sliding everywhere which
is<00:04:01.239> nice<00:04:01.450> hopefully<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.560> last<00:04:02.800> shot<00:04:03.040> turned

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
is nice hopefully that last shot turned

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.550 
is nice hopefully that last shot turned
out<00:04:03.580> okay<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.270> couldn't<00:04:04.840> really<00:04:05.020> find<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.440> good

so this is the official high torque

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.290 
so this is the official high torque
model<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.489> awesomeness<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:21.040> thing<00:04:21.340> yeah

solid round bar stock that I was using

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.460 
solid round bar stock that I was using
just<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.580> make<00:04:33.790> some<00:04:34.120> custom<00:04:34.660> bushings<00:04:35.320> for
