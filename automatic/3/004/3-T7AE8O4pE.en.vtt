00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.470 
so I'm gonna do something basic like in
a<00:02:00.780> boxing<00:02:01.230> sense<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.070> exploring<00:02:02.490> sense<00:02:02.790> that's

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
a boxing sense or exploring sense that's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.980 
a boxing sense or exploring sense that's
a<00:02:03.630> combo<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.320> use<00:02:04.440> I<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.800> hit<00:02:05.220> here<00:02:05.610> hit

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
a combo I would use I would hit here hit

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.230 
a combo I would use I would hit here hit
and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.110> hit<00:02:07.290> okay<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.880> when<00:02:09.210> I

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
and then hit okay so I know that when I

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.600 
and then hit okay so I know that when I
do<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.960> might<00:02:10.110> back<00:02:10.350> him<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:10.979> then

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
do this this might back him up and then

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.830 
do this this might back him up and then
I'm<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.850> go<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.330> into<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> wrist

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I'm going to go right into the wrist

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'm going to go right into the wrist
might<00:02:13.260> Bend<00:02:13.470> him<00:02:13.590> over<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> little<00:02:14.010> bit<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.220> I'm

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
might Bend him over a little bit but I'm

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.820 
might Bend him over a little bit but I'm
not<00:02:14.580> trying<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.970> create<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.530> bend<00:02:16.530> over

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
not trying to create that bend over

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.590 
not trying to create that bend over
process<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.520> now<00:02:17.670> he's<00:02:17.940> hooked<00:02:18.150> over<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.570> I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
process and now he's hooked over and I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.260 
process and now he's hooked over and I
got<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:20.400> shot<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:20.820> well<00:02:20.970> good<00:02:21.120> one
