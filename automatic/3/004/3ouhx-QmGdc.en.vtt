00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
intensify to 105 miles per hour by two

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.730 
intensify to 105 miles per hour by two
o'clock<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> morning<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.080> then

o'clock in the morning and then
eventually<00:00:20.480> 110<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.080> along<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
eventually 110 and as we go along you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
eventually 110 and as we go along you
see<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> becomes<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> major<00:00:23.430> hurricane<00:00:23.789> here<00:00:24.300> as

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
see it becomes a major hurricane here as

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.970 
see it becomes a major hurricane here as
it<00:00:24.510> moves<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.900> west<00:00:25.170> northwest<00:00:25.529> wind

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it moves to the west northwest wind

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
it moves to the west northwest wind
speeds<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:27.230> 125<00:00:28.230> miles<00:00:28.680> per<00:00:28.890> hour<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
speeds of 125 miles per hour as it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.999 
speeds of 125 miles per hour as it
approaches<00:00:29.849> Bermuda<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.660> then<00:00:31.230> by<00:00:31.380> Saturday

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
approaches Bermuda and then by Saturday

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.010 
approaches Bermuda and then by Saturday
way<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> track<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
way out in the track you can see that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
way out in the track you can see that
the<00:00:34.110> wind<00:00:34.260> speeds<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.620> still<00:00:34.800> 120<00:00:35.550> miles<00:00:35.790> per

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the wind speeds are still 120 miles per

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
the wind speeds are still 120 miles per
hour<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> sits<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.590> moving<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
hour as it sits are is moving to the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.979 
hour as it sits are is moving to the
west<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.270> Bermuda<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:41.450> what<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
west of Bermuda so what about this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
west of Bermuda so what about this
feeling<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.489> storm<00:00:44.760> may<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.030> threat

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
feeling that this storm may be a threat

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
feeling that this storm may be a threat
to<00:00:45.420> southern<00:00:45.870> New<00:00:45.899> England<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.860> going

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
to southern New England well I'm going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
to southern New England well I'm going
to<00:00:47.250> flip<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.640> forecast<00:00:48.210> computer<00:00:48.629> models

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to flip on the forecast computer models

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
to flip on the forecast computer models
here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> you'll<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:51.149> them

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
here and you'll see that all of them

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
here and you'll see that all of them
take<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.989> storm<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> turn<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> north

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
take this storm and turn it to the north

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
take this storm and turn it to the north
and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> northeast<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.620> does

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and then the northeast but what does

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
and then the northeast but what does
that<00:00:55.829> mean<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.190> us<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.520> means<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> storm

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that mean for us it means that the storm

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
that mean for us it means that the storm
would<00:00:57.329> throw<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.660> surf<00:00:57.899> our<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.410> but

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
would throw some surf our way but

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
would throw some surf our way but
certainly<00:00:59.250> nothing<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.879> than<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> with

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
certainly nothing more than that with

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
certainly nothing more than that with
this<00:01:00.780> track<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.350> aside<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.039> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this track right here aside from this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.299 
this track right here aside from this
blue<00:01:03.439> computer<00:01:04.439> projection<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.159> here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
blue computer projection right here

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
blue computer projection right here
which<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> model<00:01:06.299> called<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:07.049> gaps<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
which is a model called the no gaps and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
which is a model called the no gaps and
that<00:01:07.770> brings<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.159> reasonably<00:01:08.760> close<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.060> us

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that brings it reasonably close to us

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.929 
that brings it reasonably close to us
and<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.200> impacts<00:01:10.530> on

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
and there would be some impacts on

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.100 
and there would be some impacts on
Nantucket<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> Cape<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> storm<00:01:12.960> were

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Nantucket in the Cape if the storm were

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
Nantucket in the Cape if the storm were
to<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.680> track<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.220> most<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
to take that track but most of the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
to take that track but most of the
computer<00:01:15.000> models<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> east<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
computer models are well to the east of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
computer models are well to the east of
that<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.360> biggest<00:01:18.689> impact<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> does

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that so the biggest impact if it does

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.330 
that so the biggest impact if it does
follow<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.159> projected<00:01:20.790> path<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.869> out

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
follow the projected path would be out

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
follow the projected path would be out
for<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> fishing<00:01:23.759> industry<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.990> course

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
for the fishing industry and of course

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
for the fishing industry and of course
the<00:01:25.350> surf<00:01:25.530> hitting<00:01:25.950> our<00:01:26.130> south<00:01:26.700> coast<00:01:27.200> what

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the surf hitting our south coast what

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
the surf hitting our south coast what
about<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> takes<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
about if it takes what what would it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
about if it takes what what would it
take<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> bigger<00:01:31.829> impact<00:01:31.920> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
take for it to have a bigger impact in

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.039 
take for it to have a bigger impact in
southern<00:01:33.030> New<00:01:33.180> England<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> would

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
southern New England and what it would

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
southern New England and what it would
have<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> take<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> low<00:01:35.640> road

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
have to do would be to take the low road

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.840 
have to do would be to take the low road
here<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.110> lower<00:01:37.799> end<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.640> the

that's<00:02:20.430> unlikely<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.180> what<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.450> need<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's unlikely but what we need to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.090 
that's unlikely but what we need to
watch<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.050> over<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.350> next<00:02:22.530> couple<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.920> days

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
watch is over the next couple of days

watch is over the next couple of days
does<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.850> storm<00:02:24.090> track<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> little<00:02:24.690> bit

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
does the storm track a little bit

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
does the storm track a little bit
farther<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.320> south<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.250> does<00:02:26.430> make<00:02:26.640> it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
farther to the south if it does make it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.120 
farther to the south if it does make it
down<00:02:26.940> here<00:02:26.970> east<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> Bahamas<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.950> has

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
down here east of the Bahamas and it has

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.770 
down here east of the Bahamas and it has
not<00:02:29.310> yet<00:02:29.520> begun<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.970> take<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.330> turn<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
not yet begun to take that turn to the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.530 
not yet begun to take that turn to the
north<00:02:30.990> then<00:02:31.200> there's<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.410> much<00:02:31.770> much<00:02:32.160> greater

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
north then there's a much much greater

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.640 
north then there's a much much greater
potential<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.960> storm<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.290> make<00:02:34.530> an

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
potential for the storm to make an

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
potential for the storm to make an
impact<00:02:34.980> here<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.370> southeastern<00:02:36.210> New<00:02:36.420> England

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
impact here in southeastern New England

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.730 
impact here in southeastern New England
so<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.080> what<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> be

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so that's what we are going to be

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740 
so that's what we are going to be
looking<00:02:37.860> at<00:02:38.070> closely<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.120> next<00:02:39.360> couple<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
looking at closely in the next couple of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.900 
looking at closely in the next couple of
days
