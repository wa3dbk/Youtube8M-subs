it to the desktop this time you this

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.280 
it to the desktop this time you this
time<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.740> actually<00:04:58.860> replace<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:01.080> time

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
time you actually replace it the time

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.450
