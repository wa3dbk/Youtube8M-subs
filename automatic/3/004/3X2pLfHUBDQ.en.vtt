 I am glad to see you. Hi. 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.200
 Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:17.320
 I have been doing this now since I was a child 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.790
 I've been very fond of it since I was in junior high school. 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:27.160
 The first time I heard from my father, I received it as a gift for the New Year Nintendo 64 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:32.920
 Now it was the best play some gels were transferred in the next generation 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.850
 Because I did not do my English well, the legend of Zelda loads a lot of English study 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.040
 There were a lot of memories that I played and I enjoyed the game very much. 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 Pies fall a lot since then, I think I had every series called Seas and 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.579
 The pair have got here just before we reserve the right, even that came out well doesyeoseo 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 Take four 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.880
 One of the companies that have been doing business in Japan 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.860
 4 Now I was finally presented to Now Bob as soon as you want to 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.860
 Let's look at one lot 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.930
 When is the Hello relationship is nice 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:14.660
 Today is the fourth day of the second day 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:20.660
 Yesterday I had a hard time breaking the first king already. 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.580
 I woke up four times and specially Huh Jun helped me from the middle of now 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.180
 You said you were coming 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.020
 If we can do more together than to do it alone, can we break it more easily? 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.070
 I think I can make it a little easier today. 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.070
 Let's start the game from now on. 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.550
 Zelda's legend has it down like Skyward Sword 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 I'm looking forward to it. 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.300
 Oh, I have a previous version of Absolute Bookstore Assistant 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.160
 Meanwhile , since the seed is melted, it may help a little. 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.340
