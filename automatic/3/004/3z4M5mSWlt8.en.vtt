he saw that there's no gas we have him
going<00:03:15.830> into<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> speed<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.120> he<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.660> not<00:03:18.020> mining

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
going into a speed and he is not mining

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.410 
going into a speed and he is not mining
a<00:03:18.650> lot<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.950> cases<00:03:19.130> less<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:19.670> Joan<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.300> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
a lot of cases less one Joan in the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
a lot of cases less one Joan in the
extractor<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.110> that's<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.650> now<00:03:21.740> that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
extractor but that's it for now that

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.580 
extractor but that's it for now that
will<00:03:22.160> allow<00:03:22.400> him<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.760> get<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> decent<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:24.140> tech

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
will allow him to get a decent of tech

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.290 
will allow him to get a decent of tech
timing<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.220> but<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:25.550> for<00:03:25.760> now<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:25.880> only

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
timing and but so for now it's only

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.270 
timing and but so for now it's only
speed<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.020> trying<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> get<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.740> control<00:03:28.100> over

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
speed and trying to get the control over

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.280 
speed and trying to get the control over
the<00:03:28.400> map<00:03:28.690> yeah<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:31.060> think<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.140> really

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
the map yeah I think that this is really

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.320 
the map yeah I think that this is really
interesting<00:03:33.470> he<00:03:34.010> could<00:03:34.220> definitely<00:03:34.490> try<00:03:34.820> for

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
interesting he could definitely try for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.390 
interesting he could definitely try for
roche<00:03:35.900> timing<00:03:36.290> here<00:03:36.470> which<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.160> already

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
roche timing here which is already

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.440 
roche timing here which is already
strong<00:03:37.580> against<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.910> Terran<00:03:38.209> player<00:03:38.270> who

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
strong against the Terran player who

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.449 
strong against the Terran player who
goes<00:03:38.600> for<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.080> normal<00:03:39.620> factory<00:03:39.980> timing<00:03:40.340> and

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
goes for a normal factory timing and

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.949 
goes for a normal factory timing and
goes<00:03:40.610> in<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.790> barracks<00:03:41.090> after<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.450> CC<00:03:41.780> purse

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
goes in the barracks after the CC purse

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.559 
goes in the barracks after the CC purse
but<00:03:42.370> right<00:03:43.370> now<00:03:43.520> bomber<00:03:43.850> is<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.390> adding

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
but right now bomber is just adding

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.270 
but right now bomber is just adding
barracks<00:03:44.989> he's<00:03:45.080> making<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.440> tight<00:03:45.680> wall<00:03:45.950> here

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
barracks he's making a tight wall here

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.560 
barracks he's making a tight wall here
with<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.610> purple<00:03:46.910> barracks<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.270> makes<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
with a purple barracks and makes the

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.390 
with a purple barracks and makes the
bunker<00:03:47.810> behind<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.230> he's<00:03:48.350> being<00:03:48.620> safe<00:03:48.860> he

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
bunker behind it so he's being safe he

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.530 
bunker behind it so he's being safe he
knows<00:03:49.580> he<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.850> put<00:03:50.000> units<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> high

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
knows he can put units on the high

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.000 
knows he can put units on the high
ground<00:03:50.570> against<00:03:51.020> a<00:03:51.080> roach<00:03:51.260> pushers<00:03:51.739> really

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
ground against a roach pushers really

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.040 
ground against a roach pushers really
push<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.370> well<00:03:52.550> he<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.269> four<00:03:53.660> barracks

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
push as well he will have four barracks

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.590 
push as well he will have four barracks
in<00:03:54.230> total<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.680> has<00:03:54.860> been<00:03:55.070> spotted<00:03:55.370> by<00:03:55.670> Congo

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
in total that has been spotted by Congo

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.850 
in total that has been spotted by Congo
I<00:03:56.630> would<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.019> be<00:03:57.170> surprised<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.650> see<00:03:57.709> a

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
I would not be surprised to see a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.880 
I would not be surprised to see a
painting<00:03:58.100> that's<00:03:58.400> fairly<00:03:58.700> soon<00:03:59.470> yeah<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.830> mean

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
painting that's fairly soon yeah I mean

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.890 
painting that's fairly soon yeah I mean
he<00:04:01.370> really<00:04:01.760> needs<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.150> make<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.330> choice<00:04:02.570> here<00:04:02.870> I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
he really needs to make a choice here I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.210 
he really needs to make a choice here I
mean<00:04:03.080> his<00:04:03.200> third<00:04:03.410> base<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:03.739> going<00:04:03.890> down<00:04:04.070> but

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
mean his third base is going down but

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.280 
mean his third base is going down but
it's<00:04:04.340> very<00:04:04.489> late<00:04:04.820> there's<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.239> second<00:04:05.570> gas<00:04:05.750> if

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it's very late there's the second gas if

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.050 
it's very late there's the second gas if
you<00:04:06.680> are<00:04:06.890> up<00:04:07.070> against<00:04:07.459> paul<00:04:07.610> well<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.910> know

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
you are up against paul well you know

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.940 
you are up against paul well you know
that<00:04:08.300> he<00:04:08.540> likes<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.080> aggressive<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.739> he's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
that he likes to be aggressive that he's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.620 
that he likes to be aggressive that he's
usually<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.340> player<00:04:10.670> who<00:04:10.940> tries<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.209> put<00:04:11.510> out<00:04:11.600> a

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
usually a player who tries to put out a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.720 
usually a player who tries to put out a
little<00:04:11.959> bit<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.230> Russia<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.040> what<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.640> would

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
little bit of Russia so what you would

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.210 
little bit of Russia so what you would
try<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.060> do<00:04:14.269> is<00:04:14.510> be<00:04:14.750> safe<00:04:15.110> against<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.830> he

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
try to do is be safe against this and he

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.380 
try to do is be safe against this and he
doesn't<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.669> get<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.910> painting<00:04:17.239> this

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
doesn't have to get the painting this

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.270 
doesn't have to get the painting this
immediately<00:04:18.079> because<00:04:18.500> he<00:04:18.620> sees<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.950> timing

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
immediately because he sees the timing

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.009 
immediately because he sees the timing
for<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.519> barracks<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.180> he<00:04:20.299> needs<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.720> get<00:04:20.840> it

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
for the barracks but he needs to get it

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.140 
for the barracks but he needs to get it
eventually<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.859> also<00:04:22.040> spread<00:04:22.550> his<00:04:22.669> creep<00:04:22.940> so

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
eventually and also spread his creep so

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.240 
eventually and also spread his creep so
as<00:04:23.330> soon<00:04:23.510> as<00:04:23.660> mom<00:04:23.840> walks<00:04:24.140> out<00:04:24.350> onto<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.740> map<00:04:24.919> he

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
as soon as mom walks out onto the map he

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.920 
as soon as mom walks out onto the map he
can't<00:04:25.490> defend<00:04:25.640> against<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.270> without<00:04:26.540> taking

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
can't defend against it without taking

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.670 
can't defend against it without taking
too<00:04:27.050> many<00:04:27.200> loss

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
too many loss

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.560 
too many loss
with<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> timing<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:28.850> spire<00:04:29.090> here<00:04:29.389> in<00:04:29.479> the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
with the timing of the spire here in the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.360 
with the timing of the spire here in the
extractors<00:04:30.110> going<00:04:30.500> down<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> layer<00:04:31.070> i<00:04:31.100> should

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
extractors going down a layer i should

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.439 
extractors going down a layer i should
say<00:04:31.490> i<00:04:31.520> think<00:04:31.610> we're<00:04:31.850> going<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.030> see<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.210> fast

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
say i think we're going to see a fast

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.879 
say i think we're going to see a fast
spire<00:04:32.750> there's<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.139> baneling<00:04:33.440> that's<00:04:33.620> just

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
spire there's the baneling that's just

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.520 
spire there's the baneling that's just
to<00:04:33.949> be<00:04:34.039> safe<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:34.810> could<00:04:35.810> also<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.199> muta

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
to be safe we could also see a muta

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.080 
to be safe we could also see a muta
baneling<00:04:36.949> timing<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.400> don't<00:04:37.550> think<00:04:37.820> that's<00:04:37.910> as

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
baneling timing I don't think that's as

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.909 
baneling timing I don't think that's as
likely<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.780> there<00:04:39.380> are<00:04:39.500> really<00:04:39.680> strong

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
likely but there are really strong

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.200

it<00:05:16.160> puts<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.610> under<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:16.880> scan<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.300> cancels<00:05:17.630> if

it puts it under the scan and cancels if

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.850 
it puts it under the scan and cancels if
it<00:05:17.870> goes<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.169> bailing<00:05:18.440> speed<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.710> think

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
it goes in the bailing speed I think

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.499 
it goes in the bailing speed I think
we're<00:05:18.979> gonna<00:05:19.130> see<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.370> time<00:05:19.610> oh<00:05:19.820> wow<00:05:20.180> that<00:05:20.479> is

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
we're gonna see that time oh wow that is

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.249 
we're gonna see that time oh wow that is
so<00:05:21.110> cool<00:05:22.330> looks<00:05:23.330> like<00:05:23.449> just<00:05:23.660> pure<00:05:23.810> speed<00:05:24.080> pain

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
so cool looks like just pure speed pain

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.760 
so cool looks like just pure speed pain
yeah<00:05:24.680> i<00:05:24.949> mean<00:05:25.699> if<00:05:26.060> you'd<00:05:26.449> show<00:05:26.810> if<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.530> show

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
yeah i mean if you'd show if you show

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.439 
yeah i mean if you'd show if you show
the<00:05:28.160> evolution<00:05:28.669> shame<00:05:28.820> as<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.090> first<00:05:29.270> thing

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
the evolution shame as the first thing

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.450 
the evolution shame as the first thing
that<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.720> Terran<00:05:30.259> play<00:05:30.500> will<00:05:30.770> assume<00:05:31.039> is<00:05:31.190> ok

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
that the Terran play will assume is ok

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.890 
that the Terran play will assume is ok
you<00:05:31.520> go<00:05:31.789> for<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.090> little<00:05:32.210> bit<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.449> a<00:05:32.479> later<00:05:32.659> time

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
you go for a little bit of a later time

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.270 
you go for a little bit of a later time
and<00:05:33.139> he's<00:05:33.229> thinking<00:05:33.500> great<00:05:33.770> teams<00:05:34.010> like<00:05:34.190> I

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
and he's thinking great teams like I

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.409 
and he's thinking great teams like I
already<00:05:34.370> have<00:05:34.610> my<00:05:34.639> upgrade<00:05:34.970> stern<00:05:35.150> I'm<00:05:35.300> an

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
already have my upgrade stern I'm an

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.270 
already have my upgrade stern I'm an
exactly<00:05:35.750> I'm<00:05:35.990> ahead<00:05:36.139> of<00:05:36.289> you<00:05:36.409> you<00:05:36.949> are<00:05:37.099> going

exactly I'm ahead of you you are going

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.490 
exactly I'm ahead of you you are going
for<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.699> macro<00:05:38.030> game<00:05:38.210> here<00:05:38.449> as<00:05:38.599> well<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.990> then

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
for a macro game here as well and then

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.680 
for a macro game here as well and then
he<00:05:39.830> just<00:05:40.039> casted<00:05:40.460> this<00:05:40.699> is<00:05:40.849> like<00:05:41.120> mind<00:05:41.449> games

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
he just casted this is like mind games

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.089 
he just casted this is like mind games
on<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.870> completely<00:05:42.260> different<00:05:42.380> level<00:05:42.650> since

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
on a completely different level since

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.589 
on a completely different level since
the<00:05:43.220> skin<00:05:43.430> drops<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.849> evolution<00:05:44.210> chambers

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
the skin drops the evolution chambers

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.700 
the skin drops the evolution chambers
and<00:05:44.750> then<00:05:44.840> immediately<00:05:45.050> when<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.440> scan<00:05:45.650> is

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
and then immediately when the scan is

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.670 
and then immediately when the scan is
gone<00:05:46.010> cancel<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:46.729> damn<00:05:47.360> goes<00:05:47.750> foot<00:05:48.110> blinks

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
gone cancel and damn goes foot blinks

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.159 
gone cancel and damn goes foot blinks
everywhere<00:05:49.130> bailing<00:05:49.789> speed<00:05:50.210> is<00:05:50.389> nearly<00:05:50.960> done

everywhere bailing speed is nearly done
there<00:05:51.590> is<00:05:51.770> nothing<00:05:52.159> wolf<00:05:52.639> so<00:05:53.120> we<00:05:53.360> don't<00:05:53.539> mind

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
there is nothing wolf so we don't mind

the first siege tank is now being

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.659 
the first siege tank is now being
produced<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:57.530> is<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:58.039> couldn't<00:05:58.490> be<00:05:58.550> more

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
produced and this is it couldn't be more

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.399 
produced and this is it couldn't be more
dangerous<00:05:58.820> yeah<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.270> mean<00:05:59.389> he<00:05:59.509> only<00:06:00.169> has<00:06:00.380> one

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
dangerous yeah I mean he only has one

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.279 
dangerous yeah I mean he only has one
bunker<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:01.570> he's<00:06:02.570> got<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.810> lot<00:06:03.050> of<00:06:03.110> his

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
bunker and he's got a lot of his

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.659 
bunker and he's got a lot of his
production<00:06:03.740> down<00:06:03.800> there<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.070> will<00:06:04.190> have<00:06:04.250> stem

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
production down there you will have stem

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.659 
production down there you will have stem
but<00:06:05.630> these<00:06:05.750> Marines<00:06:06.110> all<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:07.190> Marines<00:06:07.460> out

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669
