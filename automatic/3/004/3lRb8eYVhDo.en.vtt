it sports sparser it is the better so
we're<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> take<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.890> half<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.160> yarn

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
we're going to take that's half the yarn

we're going to take that's half the yarn
still<00:01:03.539> too<00:01:03.719> much

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.080 

then<00:01:07.180> take<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> quarter<00:01:07.870> of<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> yarn<00:01:08.730> that's<00:01:09.730> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
then take a quarter of the yarn that's a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.260 
then take a quarter of the yarn that's a
size<00:01:10.330> 10<00:01:10.660> so<00:01:10.870> I'm<00:01:10.930> going<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.230> go<00:01:11.350> quarter<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:13.090> it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
size 10 so I'm going to go quarter if it

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.840 
size 10 so I'm going to go quarter if it
was<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.630> was<00:01:13.840> smaller<00:01:14.200> tiny<00:01:14.950> smaller<00:01:15.310> sizes<00:01:15.610> I

was it was smaller tiny smaller sizes I

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.960 
was it was smaller tiny smaller sizes I
would<00:01:15.880> take<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.510> into<00:01:16.630> an<00:01:16.810> eighth<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.850> when

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
would take it into an eighth and when

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.630 
would take it into an eighth and when

you're going to able to see that pretty
pretty<00:03:09.940> easily<00:03:10.240> underneath<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:12.600> underneath

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
pretty easily underneath the underneath

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.190 
pretty easily underneath the underneath
the<00:03:14.459> fly<00:03:15.459> itself<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.480> i<00:03:16.510> already<00:03:16.810> did<00:03:16.989> this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the fly itself and i already did this

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.160 
the fly itself and i already did this
piece<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.280> actually<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> quarter<00:03:19.180> we

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
piece this is actually a quarter we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.729 
piece this is actually a quarter we
actually<00:03:20.470> use<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> quarter<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.580> this<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> what

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
actually use a quarter for this so what

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.410 
actually use a quarter for this so what
the<00:03:23.950> yoke<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.340> be<00:03:24.459> pretty<00:03:24.730> pronounced<00:03:25.270> in

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
the yoke to be pretty pronounced in

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.770 
the yoke to be pretty pronounced in
there<00:03:25.650> take<00:03:26.650> two<00:03:26.830> turns<00:03:27.100> over<00:03:27.340> that

like to push these guys down out of the
way<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.970> trim<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.300> short<00:05:02.720> where<00:05:03.410> your<00:05:03.530> other

don't<00:06:04.360> care<00:06:04.599> one<00:06:04.840> bit<00:06:06.210> but<00:06:07.210> as<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.419> can<00:06:07.509> see

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
don't care one bit but as you can see

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.040 
don't care one bit but as you can see

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
it's translucent you can see that you

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.499 
it's translucent you can see that you
can<00:06:11.199> see<00:06:11.409> the<00:06:11.639> flame<00:06:12.639> really<00:06:12.969> stands<00:06:13.270> out

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
can see the flame really stands out

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.860 
can see the flame really stands out
inside<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.409> pink<00:06:14.620> there<00:06:15.300> with<00:06:16.300> the<00:06:16.479> colors

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870

when<00:06:17.169> you<00:06:17.229> do<00:06:17.379> colors<00:06:17.800> I'm<00:06:18.639> just<00:06:18.969> just<00:06:19.360> do<00:06:19.539> a

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
when you do colors I'm just just do a

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.029 
when you do colors I'm just just do a
lighter<00:06:20.110> color<00:06:20.530> egg<00:06:21.569> like<00:06:22.569> pink<00:06:22.870> white<00:06:23.199> I'm<00:06:23.800> a

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
lighter color egg like pink white I'm a

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.580 
lighter color egg like pink white I'm a
light<00:06:24.250> shades<00:06:24.610> of<00:06:24.819> yellow<00:06:25.169> and<00:06:26.169> then<00:06:26.289> just<00:06:26.469> go

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
light shades of yellow and then just go

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.820 
light shades of yellow and then just go
with<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.800> deep<00:06:27.460> color<00:06:27.849> for<00:06:28.840> the<00:06:28.900> yolk<00:06:29.080> so<00:06:29.620> that's

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
with a deep color for the yolk so that's

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.100 
with a deep color for the yolk so that's
it<00:06:30.819> shines<00:06:31.120> through<00:06:31.740> your<00:06:32.740> egg<00:06:33.300> but<00:06:34.300> that's

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
it shines through your egg but that's

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.760 
it shines through your egg but that's
Jeff<00:06:35.439> blood<00:06:36.060> blood<00:06:37.060> dot
