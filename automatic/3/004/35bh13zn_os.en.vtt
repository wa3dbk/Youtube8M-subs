today<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.220> gonna<00:00:02.280> be<00:00:02.460> looking<00:00:02.580> at<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.879> tool

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
today we're gonna be looking at a tool

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.230 
today we're gonna be looking at a tool
called<00:00:03.389> x2<00:00:04.350> tool<00:00:04.910> basically<00:00:05.910> lets<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.120> do

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
called x2 tool basically lets you do

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.030 
called x2 tool basically lets you do
some<00:00:06.629> neat<00:00:07.020> things<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.560> mouse<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
some neat things with the mouse and

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.339 
some neat things with the mouse and
keyboard<00:00:08.849> but<00:00:09.330> today<00:00:09.750> we're<00:00:09.870> gonna<00:00:09.929> look<00:00:10.139> at

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
keyboard but today we're gonna look at

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.499 
keyboard but today we're gonna look at
getting<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.370> coordinates<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.360> mouse

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
getting the coordinates of your mouse

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.860 
getting the coordinates of your mouse
cursor<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.880> doing<00:00:14.880> some<00:00:15.030> fun<00:00:15.210> stuff<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.690> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
cursor and doing some fun stuff with it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.019 
cursor and doing some fun stuff with it
so<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.619> we're<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> use<00:00:17.130> x2<00:00:17.760> tool

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
so basically we're going to use x2 tool

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.640 
so basically we're going to use x2 tool
which<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.779> not<00:00:18.900> installed<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.529> your

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
which if it's not installed it's in your

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
which if it's not installed it's in your
repository<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.550> ahead<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.820> install<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
repository so go ahead and install it

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.740 
repository so go ahead and install it
never<00:00:22.020> use<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> command<00:00:22.680> get<00:00:23.660> Mouse<00:00:25.160> location

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
never use the command get Mouse location

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.290 
never use the command get Mouse location
in<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.980> hit<00:00:29.099> enter<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:30.090> get

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
in there and if I hit enter now we get

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.350 
in there and if I hit enter now we get
an<00:00:30.570> x<00:00:30.929> coordinate<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.740> y-coordinate<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
an x coordinate a y-coordinate and the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.530 
an x coordinate a y-coordinate and the
screen<00:00:33.630> run<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.460> run<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> same<00:00:36.149> command

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
screen run so if I run that same command

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
screen run so if I run that same command
but<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> move<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.200> cursor<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> left

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
but I move my cursor up and to the left

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
but I move my cursor up and to the left
you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> numbers<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> smaller<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you can see the numbers get smaller the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.020 
you can see the numbers get smaller the
X<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:42.090> left<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.460> your<00:00:44.460> Y<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
X is your left and right and your Y is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.700 
X is your left and right and your Y is
your<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.350> move<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.559> cursor

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
your up and down so if I move my cursor

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.660 
your up and down so if I move my cursor
all<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.450> left<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:50.340> run<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
all the way to the left and I run that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
all the way to the left and I run that
command<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.270> X<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.809> 0<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.190> move<00:00:53.460> my

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
command you can see X is 0 if I move my

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
command you can see X is 0 if I move my
cursor<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> top<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cursor all the way to the top of the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
cursor all the way to the top of the
screen<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> run<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> command<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.670> see

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
screen and run that command you can see

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
screen and run that command you can see
Y<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.120> 0<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> screen<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Y is 0 and screen is it's just if you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
Y is 0 and screen is it's just if you
have<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.280> than<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.520> screen<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.149> figure

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have more than one screen you can figure

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.799 
have more than one screen you can figure
out<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.809> screen<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.350> cursor<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.809> but

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
out what screen your cursor is on but

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
out what screen your cursor is on but
we're<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.710> command<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.570> I'm

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we're gonna take that command and I'm

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.620 
we're gonna take that command and I'm
gonna<00:01:06.720> create<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> script<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.740> call<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> vim

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
gonna create a script will call it vim

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.760 
gonna create a script will call it vim
my<00:01:09.630> mouse<00:01:09.869> dot<00:01:10.530> SH<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.439> are<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
my mouse dot SH and we are going to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
my mouse dot SH and we are going to
create<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> bash<00:01:14.220> scripts<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.850> bin<00:01:15.180> bash<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
create a bash scripts so bin bash at the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
create a bash scripts so bin bash at the
top<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.330> we're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> create<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
top here and we're going to create a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.910 
top here and we're going to create a
while<00:01:19.439> loop<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.460> say<00:01:20.759> while<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
while loop so say while one so this is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
while loop so say while one so this is
wild<00:01:26.250> truth<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.420> basically<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.869> gonna

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
wild truth so this basically it's gonna

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
wild truth so this basically it's gonna
loop<00:01:28.259> until<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.920> kill<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> command<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.990> then

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
loop until we kill the command and then

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
loop until we kill the command and then
we'll<00:01:31.200> put<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> done<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> do

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
we'll put our do and done I like to do

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
we'll put our do and done I like to do
that<00:01:32.909> before<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.240> forget<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.960> we'll<00:01:34.320> add<00:01:34.500> our

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that before I forget and we'll add our

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:44.719 
that before I forget and we'll add our
command<00:01:35.659> do<00:01:36.659> tool<00:01:39.710> get<00:01:40.710> Mouse<00:01:41.540> location<00:01:43.729> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
command do tool get Mouse location we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
command do tool get Mouse location we
will<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.060> save<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.780> script<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.740> change

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
will now save that script we will change

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.719 
will now save that script we will change
the<00:01:47.759> mode<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.390> make<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.320> execute<00:01:49.860> also<00:01:50.130> plus<00:01:50.399> X

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the mode to make it execute also plus X

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.069 
the mode to make it execute also plus X
and<00:01:51.119> we'll<00:01:51.450> say<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:52.649> mouse<00:01:53.210> dot<00:01:54.210> SH<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.049> we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and we'll say my mouse dot SH and we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.340 
and we'll say my mouse dot SH and we
will<00:01:55.799> run<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.229> it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
will run that and you can see it's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
will run that and you can see it's
looping<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.240> coordinates

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
looping and you can see the coordinates

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.530 
looping and you can see the coordinates
changing<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> move<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.700> cursor<00:02:02.969> around

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
changing as I move my cursor around

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
changing as I move my cursor around

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
go back into my script here and what I'm

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
go back into my script here and what I'm
going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> say

going to do is I'm going to say
I'm<00:02:13.349> gonna<00:02:13.530> take<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.040> pipe<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.430> into

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
I'm gonna take that and pipe it into

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.559 
I'm gonna take that and pipe it into
said<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:17.340> we're<00:02:17.459> gonna<00:02:17.550> use<00:02:17.730> said<00:02:18.000> substitute

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
said and we're gonna use said substitute

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.820 
said and we're gonna use said substitute
here<00:02:18.780> I'm<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:18.930> gonna<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.200> into<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.440> details

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
here I'm not gonna go into the details

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.490 
here I'm not gonna go into the details
too<00:02:20.099> much<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.959> say<00:02:22.170> said

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
too much but we're going to say said

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
too much but we're going to say said
substitute<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.690> inside<00:02:24.690> single<00:02:25.019> quotes

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
substitute and inside single quotes

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
substitute and inside single quotes
we're<00:02:26.280> substituting<00:02:26.580> basically<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.390> remove

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
we're substituting basically to remove

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.949 
we're substituting basically to remove
the<00:02:27.959> X<00:02:28.260> call<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.190> y<00:02:29.340> callin<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.390> screen<00:02:30.720> :

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the X call on the y callin the screen :

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.680 
the X call on the y callin the screen :
and<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> screen<00:02:31.769> number<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.599> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and the screen number so this is the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.059 
and the screen number so this is the
command<00:02:34.019> right<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:35.420> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.750> need<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.410> will

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
command right here if you need it I will

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.670 
command right here if you need it I will
put<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> link<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.450> script<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.230> final

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
put a link to this script the final

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.080 
put a link to this script the final
script<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> description<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.000> can

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
script in the description so you can

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
script in the description so you can
download<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.690> look<00:02:42.840> at<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:45.230> save<00:02:46.230> that

download and look at it and save that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.830 
download and look at it and save that
we'll<00:02:47.040> run<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> again<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.060> time<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.690> get

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
we'll run it again and this time we get

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
we'll run it again and this time we get
the<00:02:49.019> same<00:02:49.230> thing<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.519> number

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the same thing but with just the number

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.259 
the same thing but with just the number
output<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.599> don't<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> X<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.549> Y<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
output we don't have the X the Y or the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.699 
output we don't have the X the Y or the
screen<00:02:54.599> we<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.230> coordinates

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
screen we just have the coordinates

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.610 
screen we just have the coordinates
separated<00:02:56.190> by<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> comma<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.880> space<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> now

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
separated by a comma in a space so now

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.589 
separated by a comma in a space so now
let's<00:02:59.459> do<00:02:59.640> something<00:02:59.910> useful<00:03:00.239> with<00:03:00.569> that

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
let's do something useful with that

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.220 
let's do something useful with that
we'll<00:03:01.079> go<00:03:01.200> ctrl<00:03:01.680> C<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.040> kill<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:03.049> we'll<00:03:04.049> go

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
we'll go ctrl C to kill that we'll go

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.199 
we'll go ctrl C to kill that we'll go
back<00:03:04.410> into<00:03:04.620> our<00:03:04.709> script<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.000> what<00:03:06.120> we're

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
back into our script here and what we're

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.220 
back into our script here and what we're
going<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.540> we're<00:03:06.629> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.780> turn<00:03:07.019> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
going to do is we're going to turn that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.559 
going to do is we're going to turn that
output<00:03:07.709> into<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> variable<00:03:08.280> I'll<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.360> make<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
output into a variable I'll just make a

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.050 
output into a variable I'll just make a
variable<00:03:09.989> called<00:03:10.230> M<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:11.010> Mouse<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.910> we're

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
variable called M for Mouse and we're

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.970 
variable called M for Mouse and we're
going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.239> put<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.450> into<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.260> little

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
going to put that into the little

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.520 
going to put that into the little
symbols<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.000> once<00:03:15.840> again<00:03:16.079> can<00:03:16.290> never

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
symbols that I once again can never

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.280 
symbols that I once again can never
remember<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.889> name<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.569> they<00:03:18.569> are<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
remember the name of they are on the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.500 
remember the name of they are on the
same<00:03:19.500> key<00:03:19.859> as<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.069> till<00:03:20.310> Daile<00:03:20.549> which<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.269> on

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
same key as the till Daile which is on

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.539 
same key as the till Daile which is on
the<00:03:21.750> top<00:03:21.930> row<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.769> number<00:03:23.040> row<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.459> your

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
the top row the number row of your

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.420 
the top row the number row of your
keyboard<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.359> next<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> one<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:26.220> looks

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
keyboard right next to the one it looks

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.940 
keyboard right next to the one it looks
like<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.579> single<00:03:26.850> quote<00:03:27.090> anyway<00:03:27.829> put<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
like a single quote anyway put the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.970 
like a single quote anyway put the
command<00:03:29.280> within<00:03:29.489> those<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.989> variable

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
command within those and so the variable

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.680 
command within those and so the variable
will<00:03:32.099> become<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> output<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.329> command

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
will become the output of that command

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.990 
will become the output of that command
and<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:35.040> we'll<00:03:35.160> create<00:03:35.370> an<00:03:35.549> if-then

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and then we'll create an if-then

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.890 
and then we'll create an if-then
statement<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.569> we'll<00:03:36.690> say<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.900> in

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
statement and we'll say if and in

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.140 
statement and we'll say if and in
parentheses<00:03:40.410> we'll<00:03:40.560> say<00:03:40.799> M<00:03:41.040> equals<00:03:43.069> 0<00:03:44.150> comma

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
parentheses we'll say M equals 0 comma

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.740 
parentheses we'll say M equals 0 comma

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
put whatever command we want in here

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.830 
put whatever command we want in here
basically<00:04:01.019> we're<00:04:01.410> saying<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.950> if<00:04:02.510> my<00:04:03.510> mouse

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
basically we're saying is if my mouse

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.949 
basically we're saying is if my mouse
cursor<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.769> at<00:04:05.190> 0<00:04:05.519> 0<00:04:05.579> which<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.269> top<00:04:06.599> left

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
cursor is at 0 0 which is the top left

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.259 
cursor is at 0 0 which is the top left
of<00:04:07.109> my<00:04:07.169> screen<00:04:07.260> then<00:04:08.190> run<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.579> command<00:04:08.819> and

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
of my screen then run this command and

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.680 
of my screen then run this command and
we'll<00:04:09.599> just<00:04:09.780> say<00:04:09.959> echo<00:04:11.180> top<00:04:12.650> left

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.550 

so<00:04:18.209> we'll<00:04:19.209> run<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.510> command<00:04:19.810> now<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.019> can<00:04:20.410> see

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
so we'll run the command now you can see

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.110 
so we'll run the command now you can see
nothing's<00:04:20.860> happening<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.310> move<00:04:21.550> my<00:04:21.700> cursor<00:04:21.730> up

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
nothing's happening I move my cursor up

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.210 
nothing's happening I move my cursor up
to<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.330> top<00:04:22.540> left<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.230> it<00:04:23.740> starts<00:04:24.040> printing

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
to the top left and it starts printing

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.580 
to the top left and it starts printing
the<00:04:24.430> top<00:04:24.700> left<00:04:25.030> now<00:04:26.020> what's<00:04:26.170> great<00:04:26.320> about<00:04:26.350> this

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the top left now what's great about this

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.870 
the top left now what's great about this
is<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.250> create<00:04:27.550> your<00:04:27.610> own<00:04:27.670> little

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
is that you can create your own little

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.270 
is that you can create your own little
mouse<00:04:28.120> gestures<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.930> way<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.770> instead<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
mouse gestures in a way that instead of

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.770 
mouse gestures in a way that instead of
just<00:04:30.370> echo<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.750> input<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:33.780> application

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
just echo you can input a application

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.090 
just echo you can input a application
name<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.140> there<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.500> it'll<00:04:35.620> start<00:04:35.950> up<00:04:36.040> that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
name in there and it'll start up that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.610 
name in there and it'll start up that
application<00:04:36.780> when<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.810> go<00:04:38.140> up<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.440> top

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
application when you go up to the top

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.610 
application when you go up to the top
screen<00:04:39.570> top<00:04:40.570> left<00:04:40.870> corner<00:04:41.140> of<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.260> screen<00:04:41.380> so
