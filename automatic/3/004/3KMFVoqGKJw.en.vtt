soap on it and then rub it around and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.250 
soap on it and then rub it around and
then<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.030> clean<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:25.510> also<00:02:25.660> very<00:02:25.960> cost

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
then it's clean it's also very cost

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.840 
then it's clean it's also very cost
effective<00:02:26.740> because<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.700> keep

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
