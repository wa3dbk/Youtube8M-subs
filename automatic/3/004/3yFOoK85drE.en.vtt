00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello everyone I'm with a stash today 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.890
 I come to show and teach a little more 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.330
 the information again the already ex boom 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:17.259
 but I 9940 very well this new cd 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:23.900
 1099 40 has a power of 3 thousand 200 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:26.930
 watts rms equivalent to 35 thousand watts pmp 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.460
 what stands out again the james 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 bond is that it is much bigger 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.079
 the speakers are incredibly large 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.329
 and other than that the speakers 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.269
 superiors who have the means and 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.540
 twitters can be separated from the 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.540
 subwoofers 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.060
 the inclination of the speakers is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.700
 quite acceptable almost in a way 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.330
 line array 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.430
 in the unit that practically 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:04.199
 apparently it's like a lathe to table 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 villa and it has all like two albums the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 I do not really know the functions very well 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.160
 who can play but practically 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.340
 this having cross fader can 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.940
 control almost two songs or two 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 audio sources for example 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.860
 can place a usb and another usb in 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.570
 play different songs and 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.850
 make them mix with the cross to see 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.980
 at the bottom we see some buttons 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 whites are possibly those 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.159
 Effects buttons manuals 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 and also has the big box pencil that is 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.710
 the one that applies effects 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.630
 predetermined within the system very 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.050
 well the truth regarding the functions 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 I do not know very well but we see with the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.210
 how many characteristics that already 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.370
 less are already known for example that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.979
 has a tray of a cds the truth 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.170
 that is already normal in the equipment of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.619
 new generation generally and to all 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.140
 they come with that is the number of slots 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.480
 of disk that already only comes with one 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.000
 usb capacity 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.210
 the novelty that includes this new the ex 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.210
 boom is that it has bluetooth but also 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.310
 additional to that has control of has 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.260
 nfc lnfs synchronization is the same 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.300
 that uses sony that one touch calls 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.680
 which you bring to your device 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.320
 mobile to the system and the system starts 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.500
 to work with him with the cell phone in 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.410
 this case to the haul when approaching the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.410
 mobile device to the former boom 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.100
 automatically in the cell will appear 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.410
 the application of the bluetooth remote 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 because you can control we had already 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.340
 explained earlier in a previous video with 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.130
 the cde 1,095 30 that he serves to search 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.680
 songs and control the system by 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.850
 medium of the cell the lighting is 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.400
 very well done 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.550
 It seems to me that in this case he does 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.820
 is implementing a new lighting 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.640
 it's a new one it seems to me that's not how 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.370
 the multicolored but in this case the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.910
 subwoofers are internally illuminated 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.990
 red and have the part 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.910
 external a white flash light which 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.340
 because there is also a little more 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.750
 parties and then the truth to a touch very 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.090
 very good good this one from the iecs book is going to 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.040
 be pretty clear, it's going to be a lot 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.950
 lighter than the samsung inscription min 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.739
 67 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.660
 in colombia the price is almost 3 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.080
 millions of pesos 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.610
 but the truth is that it is quite expensive as 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.270
 for a sound equipment although despite 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.850
 of so many so many qualities that 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.480
 has and so much power because there are people 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.000
 that maybe if you buy it but it seems to be 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.950
 It seems that just like I got the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.320
 sony 67 and the sun and 65 the and he's also 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 thinking about taking a low-cost model 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.489
 that could be possibly could not be 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.590
 make less power would have less 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.740
 qualities and it could be much more 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.599
 economical than the 99 m I explained 40 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.330
 be on sale in the market from 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.639
 November although you can see by 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.110
 these weeks in some stores 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.000
 some warehouses already report that the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.630
 they have exhibited 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.370
 but officially the sale of 15 and 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.820
 it does not come anywhere in the world practically 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 throughout Latin America where there were Xbox 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.130
 there will be selling this magician is yes 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.590
 they want to know more information still in 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.890
 my facebook page or follow me 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.840
 YouTube account to know more 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.290
 information later 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.020
 bring a new video trying this new 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.629
 he james cook 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.240
 to see if it meets the expectations that 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:12.120
 one hopes good thank you very much for watching 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.120
 the video see you next time 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.819
 once 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.530
 do not
