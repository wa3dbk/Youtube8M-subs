off and it went in pretty much the same

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
off and it went in pretty much the same
kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.979> via<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.670> concede<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> also<00:01:30.570> i

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
too much there as you can see because a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.270 
too much there as you can see because a
better<00:02:46.230> check<00:02:46.530> picks<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.829> up<00:02:46.889> pretty<00:02:47.069> easily

with<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.820> pie<00:05:09.000> we<00:05:09.600> go<00:05:09.720> inside<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.080> box<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.470> we

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
with the pie we go inside the box and we

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.980 
with the pie we go inside the box and we
make<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:11.100> 2-1<00:05:11.790> then<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:12.090> 13th<00:05:12.510> minute<00:05:12.570> yes<00:05:12.900> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
make it 2-1 then the 13th minute yes the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.690 
make it 2-1 then the 13th minute yes the
ball<00:05:13.140> with<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.410> bow<00:05:13.590> bow<00:05:13.740> tries<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.160> reject<00:05:14.550> some

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
ball with a bow bow tries to reject some

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.000 
ball with a bow bow tries to reject some
Martinez<00:05:15.210> but<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.870> think<00:05:16.440> we<00:05:16.560> just<00:05:16.590> cleared

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
Martinez but I think we just cleared

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.620 
Martinez but I think we just cleared
away<00:05:17.130> so<00:05:17.250> he<00:05:17.460> picks<00:05:17.670> up<00:05:17.730> a<00:05:17.850> corner<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.300> guess

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
away so he picks up a corner and guess

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.480 
away so he picks up a corner and guess
what<00:05:18.870> he<00:05:19.050> once<00:05:19.290> again<00:05:19.620> gets<00:05:19.830> his<00:05:19.950> head<00:05:20.100> onto<00:05:20.250> it

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
what he once again gets his head onto it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.610 
what he once again gets his head onto it
and<00:05:20.640> makes<00:05:20.820> it<00:05:20.970> 22<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.630> get<00:05:22.050> him<00:05:22.110> back<00:05:22.350> into<00:05:22.530> the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
and makes it 22 to get him back into the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020 
and makes it 22 to get him back into the
game<00:05:22.890> but<00:05:22.950> then<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.220> few<00:05:23.430> minutes<00:05:23.640> later<00:05:23.880> we

Rica a little bit lucky pulls off a

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.320 
Rica a little bit lucky pulls off a
tackle<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.310> first<00:05:35.610> wanted<00:05:35.940> would<00:05:36.090> have<00:05:36.180> been<00:05:36.300> a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
tackle I first wanted would have been a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.700 
tackle I first wanted would have been a
penalty<00:05:36.540> or<00:05:36.870> could<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.110> been<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.290> penalty<00:05:37.470> but

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
penalty or could have been a penalty but

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.860 
penalty or could have been a penalty but
it's<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.610> think<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:39.120> said<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.390> fan<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:39.570> hit<00:05:39.780> the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
it's I think it said the fan I hit the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.540 
it's I think it said the fan I hit the
ball<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.200> properly<00:05:40.560> but<00:05:40.860> um<00:05:40.980> anyway<00:05:41.310> just

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
ball that properly but um anyway just

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.770 
ball that properly but um anyway just
before<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:41.970> time<00:05:42.120> once<00:05:42.360> again<00:05:42.479> but<00:05:42.750> I

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
before of time once again but I

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.659 
before of time once again but I
refundable<00:05:43.020> we<00:05:43.350> go<00:05:43.530> for<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.860> shot<00:05:44.100> we<00:05:44.250> got<00:05:44.280> past

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
refundable we go for a shot we got past

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.000 
refundable we go for a shot we got past
two<00:05:44.850> defenders<00:05:45.060> so<00:05:45.510> if<00:05:45.720> we<00:05:46.290> score<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.710> one<00:05:46.890> we

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
two defenders so if we score that one we

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.650 
two defenders so if we score that one we
we<00:05:47.280> would<00:05:47.430> have<00:05:47.520> completed<00:05:47.880> another<00:05:48.300> chance

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
we would have completed another chance

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.360 
we would have completed another chance
very<00:05:48.990> unlucky<00:05:49.320> there<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:49.800> then<00:05:49.919> from<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
very unlucky there but then from the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.280 
very unlucky there but then from the
counterattack<00:05:50.760> in<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.180> 45th<00:05:51.660> minute<00:05:51.810> he<00:05:52.080> goes

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
counterattack in the 45th minute he goes

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.380 
counterattack in the 45th minute he goes
through<00:05:52.500> with<00:05:52.650> Jackson<00:05:52.979> Martinez<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.910> makes

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
through with Jackson Martinez it makes

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.540 
through with Jackson Martinez it makes
it<00:05:54.540> 3-3<00:05:55.140> pretty<00:05:55.380> much<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.590> third<00:05:55.919> chance<00:05:56.130> of<00:05:56.400> the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
it 3-3 pretty much a third chance of the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.040 
it 3-3 pretty much a third chance of the
game<00:05:56.700> if<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:56.970> count<00:05:57.180> those<00:05:57.360> those<00:05:57.840> two

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
game if you count those those two

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.900 
game if you count those those two
headers<00:05:58.290> as<00:05:58.530> well<00:05:58.680> then<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:59.010> 61st<00:05:59.520> minute<00:05:59.610> in

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
headers as well then the 61st minute in

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.400 
headers as well then the 61st minute in
the<00:06:00.030> second<00:06:00.330> off<00:06:00.450> he<00:06:00.570> gets<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.900> ball<00:06:00.930> but<00:06:01.169> God

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
the second off he gets the ball but God

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.630 
the second off he gets the ball but God
rather<00:06:01.620> when<00:06:01.860> he's<00:06:01.950> caused<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.160> pretty<00:06:02.460> nice

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
rather when he's caused a pretty nice

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.730 
rather when he's caused a pretty nice
goal<00:06:02.910> there<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.510> make<00:06:03.750> it<00:06:03.810> 4-3<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.500> actually

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
goal there to make it 4-3 and actually

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.590 
goal there to make it 4-3 and actually
given<00:06:05.040> maliit<00:06:05.310> and<00:06:05.550> yeah<00:06:06.030> at<00:06:06.120> that<00:06:06.180> point<00:06:06.300> I

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
given maliit and yeah at that point I

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.060 
given maliit and yeah at that point I
pretty<00:06:06.810> much<00:06:06.900> had<00:06:07.140> enough<00:06:07.350> of<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.560> because<00:06:07.860> I

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
pretty much had enough of it because I

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.010 
pretty much had enough of it because I
just<00:06:08.729> want<00:06:08.880> to<00:06:08.970> get<00:06:09.090> back<00:06:09.270> into<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.660> game<00:06:09.810> and

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
just want to get back into the game and

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.230 
just want to get back into the game and
we<00:06:10.410> also<00:06:10.860> score<00:06:11.220> a<00:06:11.250> header<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.550> not<00:06:11.820> an<00:06:11.940> Isis

we also score a header that not an Isis
gold<00:06:12.450> oh<00:06:12.570> but<00:06:12.810> we<00:06:13.050> do<00:06:13.200> get<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.410> go<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:14.220> then<00:06:14.430> you

gold oh but we do get a go and then you

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.190 
gold oh but we do get a go and then you
can<00:06:14.820> believe<00:06:14.970> it<00:06:15.090> in<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.390> 82nd<00:06:15.960> minute<00:06:15.990> he

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
can believe it in the 82nd minute he

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.080 
can believe it in the 82nd minute he
scores<00:06:16.560> from<00:06:16.710> another<00:06:17.280> header<00:06:17.520> once<00:06:17.820> again

with<00:06:18.210> Jackson<00:06:18.540> Martinez<00:06:18.840> to<00:06:19.080> it<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.350> complete

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
with Jackson Martinez to it to complete

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.469 
with Jackson Martinez to it to complete
this<00:06:19.860> hedrick<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.880> is<00:06:21.000> pretty<00:06:21.120> much<00:06:21.300> how

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
this hedrick so that is pretty much how

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.820 
this hedrick so that is pretty much how
the<00:06:21.510> game<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.050> take<00:06:22.229> the<00:06:22.350> stats<00:06:22.620> where<00:06:22.770> I

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
the game and I take the stats where I

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.190 
the game and I take the stats where I
think<00:06:23.190> pretty<00:06:23.490> even<00:06:23.910> but<00:06:24.570> I<00:06:24.600> me<00:06:24.840> unfortunately

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
think pretty even but I me unfortunately

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.020
