00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.640
 o o 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.530
 e 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.389
 Oh 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.389
 hum hum hum 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.439
 and greet everyone this is besanÃ§on f 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.220
 how are you so we find ourselves for 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.090
 a new video how to protect his 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.450
 coffers in pvp faction cottage I believe that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.410
 just broke the roof so here's me to 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.079
 every time I make a base 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.500
 now it's a dear friend who has me 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:47.899
 learned that it's called hassan 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.429
 so I show you that know that 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.710
 now I use this technique to 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.140
 every time so imagine that this is 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.600
 your base in worse guen you could be 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.179
 much bigger to your needs 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.129
 obsidian and that's just this part 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.679
 it will make your chests room 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.830
 here we do not see with water but there is 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.470
 well two double hulls on each side 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.080
 to show you welcome to remove the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.830
 sfio I think it is to take in 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.090
 bucket of water it's all the time empty I 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.740
 will delete all sources 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.990
 others how much do you show it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.370
 it will have to be filled with water everywhere 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.370
 turn by turn and it removes 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.470
 saved obscure so here is in fact you 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.680
 do a bac like that for everything in 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.650
 obsidian we have protected ourselves well and 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.369
 so you have four jobs so 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.229
 above 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.030
 if you have a bigger base I 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.900
 advise you of the man doing a there 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.009
 were only 3 to Dual shell cov 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.259
 still a double body so three lines 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.460
 three places three lines third finally 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 you make a square base where you 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.580
 try to do that or for the there you 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.890
 will require a lot of oxygen 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.989
 me as I told you now 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.080
 I use that skeptical account there this is 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.560
 really well protected because of a 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 already if they manage to break through 6 eric's 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.070
 that side they 're going to break so that's okay 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.340
 go all the jobs and suddenly the bodies 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.930
 are already going to be well protected customers and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
 already they have to break through this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.239
 layer of small diene and blow it will be 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.310
 much better and 6.6 at risk by that they 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.940
 explode they fall on half 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.470
 slab and that if it's going to happen to us 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.019
 farting is deprived of water everywhere 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.510
 is going to be worse than anything else so 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.200
 here I am using all the time all 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.340
 the time also technical 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.750
 so if you have that lower you put 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.690
 a like says that the mans in the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.239
 comments and maybe I will do it again 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.140
 videos on the pvp faction says man 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.599
 in the comments if you want 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.540
 other videos on the pvp bill go 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.750
 I tell you next time and hi 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.750
 everybody 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.280
 the punks and yes because in part are 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:43.349
 enough to two one to have to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.349
 infinity and
