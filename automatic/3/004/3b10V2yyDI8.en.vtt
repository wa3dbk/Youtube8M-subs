 it's here 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.680
 he's making 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.520
 how can you define 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.280
 is what here if I go back to do df works specifically with the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.880

 here and power does strength 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.710

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.889
 physics are also time 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.280
 although they arrived 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.259
 it's impossible 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.349
 after being shot in this way of law 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.299
 also by the issue of socialization

 sky 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.639
 and go ahead otherwise if it were not retired 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.719
 physical activity 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.209
 at any age it was not decided Sunday and Tuesday 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.299
 this specialty terminology 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.479
 because life is 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.009
 sleeping lion 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.359
 it's another time of maturity

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.559
 the work 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.090
 because if you abuse the port a wallet of a bed 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.400
 naturally it will atrophy 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.490
 and death itself 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.639
 all
