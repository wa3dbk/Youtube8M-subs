00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.639

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in the Venice Biennial and she felt

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
in the Venice Biennial and she felt
extremely<00:00:45.030> uncomfortable<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.899> idea<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
extremely uncomfortable at this idea you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
extremely uncomfortable at this idea you
have<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> understand<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> Spain<00:00:48.059> since<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
have to understand that Spain since the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
have to understand that Spain since the
Civil<00:00:48.870> War<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.440> probably<00:00:49.829> even<00:00:49.980> before<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
Civil War and probably even before that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.290 
Civil War and probably even before that
was<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> country<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:53.000> divided<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> his

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
was a country very much divided in his

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
was a country very much divided in his
identity<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:54.930> particularly<00:00:55.260> after<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
identity but particularly after the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.260 
identity but particularly after the
Civil<00:00:55.710> War<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.789> very<00:00:57.120> much

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
Civil War and so it's very much

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
Civil War and so it's very much
ingrained<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> culture<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.949> Spain<00:00:59.340> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
ingrained in the culture of Spain to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
ingrained in the culture of Spain to
feel<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.480> uncomfortable<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:01.230> anybody

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
feel very uncomfortable when anybody

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
feel very uncomfortable when anybody
tries<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> say<00:01:02.250> Spain<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> represent

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
tries to say Spain and you represent

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
tries to say Spain and you represent
Spain<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.220> first<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
Spain so the first thing is is that that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
Spain so the first thing is is that that
that<00:01:06.510> made<00:01:06.720> her<00:01:06.840> feel<00:01:06.960> incredibly

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that made her feel incredibly

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
that made her feel incredibly
uncomfortable<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.070> second<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.760> also

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
uncomfortable but second it was also

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
uncomfortable but second it was also
just<00:01:09.299> simply<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:09.990> aesthetic<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.590> artistic

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
just simply an aesthetic and artistic

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
just simply an aesthetic and artistic
reflection<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.090> artist<00:01:12.270> she<00:01:12.570> felt

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
reflection that as an artist she felt

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
reflection that as an artist she felt
very<00:01:13.200> uncomfortable<00:01:13.409> having<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.159> represent<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
very uncomfortable having to represent a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450 
very uncomfortable having to represent a
whole<00:01:14.790> artistic<00:01:15.299> community<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
whole artistic community so for the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
whole artistic community so for the
people<00:01:17.610> who<00:01:17.820> don't<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> surroundings

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
people who don't know the surroundings

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.530 
people who don't know the surroundings
the<00:01:19.470> Spanish<00:01:19.950> pavilion<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> first

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the Spanish pavilion is really the first

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
the Spanish pavilion is really the first
one<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> left<00:01:22.259> side<00:01:22.650> when<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> enter<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
I will try to turn that into the subject

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.760 
I will try to turn that into the subject
of<00:01:39.759> my<00:01:39.939> work<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.899> title<00:01:41.109> very<00:01:41.380> much<00:01:41.530> came

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
of my work so the title very much came

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.740 
of my work so the title very much came
from<00:01:41.920> them<00:01:42.100> but<00:01:42.759> one<00:01:43.060> also<00:01:43.179> has<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.450> remember

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
from them but one also has to remember

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.630 
from them but one also has to remember
that<00:01:43.960> actually<00:01:44.469> dota<00:01:44.679> has<00:01:44.829> been<00:01:45.009> working<00:01:45.280> on

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
that actually dota has been working on

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.779 
that actually dota has been working on
the<00:01:46.060> idea<00:01:46.209> of<00:01:46.509> marginality<00:01:47.350> as<00:01:48.310> an<00:01:48.490> artistic

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
the idea of marginality as an artistic

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.620 
the idea of marginality as an artistic
device<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> few<00:01:51.340> years<00:01:51.610> now<00:01:51.700> she's<00:01:52.479> been

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
device for a few years now she's been

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.419 
device for a few years now she's been
very<00:01:52.750> interested<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.500> strategies<00:01:54.310> of

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
very interested in strategies of

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.569 
very interested in strategies of
counterculture<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.590> historically<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.950> also

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
counterculture and historically and also

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.849 
counterculture and historically and also
contemporarily<00:01:58.359> so<00:01:58.959> somehow<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.319> two<00:01:59.560> things

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
contemporarily so somehow the two things

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.279 
contemporarily so somehow the two things
really<00:02:00.100> fit<00:02:00.429> and<00:02:00.700> that's<00:02:00.909> when<00:02:01.209> in<00:02:02.110> the

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
really fit and that's when in the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.569 
really fit and that's when in the
discussion<00:02:02.739> with<00:02:02.860> her<00:02:03.039> she<00:02:03.220> really<00:02:03.369> thought

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
discussion with her she really thought

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.190 
discussion with her she really thought
okay<00:02:03.939> well<00:02:04.209> you<00:02:04.360> know<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.509> can<00:02:04.689> make<00:02:04.810> these<00:02:04.989> two

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
okay well you know I can make these two

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.809 
okay well you know I can make these two
things<00:02:05.380> come<00:02:05.560> together<00:02:05.739> and<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.489> the<00:02:06.610> whole

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
things come together and so the whole

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.330 
things come together and so the whole
project<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.630> very<00:02:07.929> much<00:02:08.079> about<00:02:08.410> studying

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
project is very much about studying

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.089 
project is very much about studying
present<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.119> today<00:02:10.450> various<00:02:11.200> aspects<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.860> what

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
present in today various aspects of what

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.150 
present in today various aspects of what
it<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.549> be<00:02:12.579> marginal<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> how<00:02:13.690> artists<00:02:14.530> use

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
it is to be marginal and how artists use

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.089 
it is to be marginal and how artists use
marginality<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.510> protect<00:02:16.989> themselves<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
marginality to protect themselves to

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.789 
marginality to protect themselves to
give<00:02:18.280> themselves<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.819> space<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.239> freedom<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:20.470> in

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
give themselves a space of freedom in in

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.100 
give themselves a space of freedom in in
their<00:02:20.950> practice<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.579> their<00:02:21.700> production<00:02:22.209> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
their practice in their production the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.750 
their practice in their production the
exhibition<00:02:23.319> has<00:02:23.709> some<00:02:23.890> historical<00:02:24.400> members

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
exhibition has some historical members

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.319 
exhibition has some historical members
so<00:02:24.879> actually<00:02:25.209> includes<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.980> swiss<00:02:27.329> figure

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
so actually includes the swiss figure

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.330 
so actually includes the swiss figure
very<00:02:28.629> important<00:02:29.140> Robert<00:02:29.410> Wilson<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.160> his

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
very important Robert Wilson and his

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.100 
very important Robert Wilson and his
micro<00:02:30.760> scripts<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.360> know<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.690> way<00:02:31.840> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
micro scripts you know the way of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.500 
micro scripts you know the way of
writing<00:02:32.470> very<00:02:32.920> very<00:02:33.160> small<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.299> can't

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
writing very very small that you can't

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.879 
writing very very small that you can't
really<00:02:34.690> read<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.139> and<00:02:35.350> actually<00:02:35.500> he<00:02:35.769> would

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
really read it and actually he would

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.800 
really read it and actually he would
feel<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.340> way<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.760> he<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.209> entire

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
feel that way that he would have entire

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.090 
feel that way that he would have entire
freedom<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:38.470> people<00:02:38.739> would<00:02:38.829> not<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:38.980> able

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
freedom because people would not be able

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.259 
freedom because people would not be able
to<00:02:39.220> actually<00:02:39.370> read<00:02:39.670> what<00:02:39.910> he<00:02:40.000> had<00:02:40.120> written

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
to actually read what he had written

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.610 
to actually read what he had written
it's<00:02:40.900> difficult<00:02:41.680> yes<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.900> other<00:02:44.079> historical

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it's difficult yes to other historical

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's difficult yes to other historical
figures<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:45.069> James<00:02:45.370> Joyce<00:02:45.459> who<00:02:46.299> used

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
figures like James Joyce who used

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.069 
figures like James Joyce who used
nonsense<00:02:47.500> language<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.220> order<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.579> be<00:02:48.700> able<00:02:48.790> to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
nonsense language in order to be able to

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.309 
nonsense language in order to be able to
misguide<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.680> reader<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.750> somehow<00:02:52.750> explode

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
misguide the reader and somehow explode

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.910 
misguide the reader and somehow explode
the<00:02:53.470> expectations<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.579> reader<00:02:54.870> two

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the expectations of the reader two

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.990 
the expectations of the reader two
historical<00:02:56.920> figures<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.220> Intel<00:02:57.549> available

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
historical figures like Intel available

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.759 
historical figures like Intel available
so<00:02:58.120> they're<00:02:58.269> like<00:02:58.480> these<00:02:58.660> kind<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.930> literary

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
so they're like these kind of literary

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.920 
so they're like these kind of literary
historical<00:03:00.340> figures<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.000> their<00:03:01.180> symbol

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
historical figures but their symbol

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.080 
historical figures but their symbol
other<00:03:02.139> figures<00:03:02.620> they're<00:03:02.769> also<00:03:02.919> in<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.579> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
other figures they're also in this in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.839 
other figures they're also in this in
this<00:03:04.269> project<00:03:04.450> because<00:03:05.280> once<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.519> process

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
this project because once the process

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.819 
this project because once the process
was<00:03:07.000> decided<00:03:07.510> once<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> subject<00:03:08.169> was<00:03:08.260> decided

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
was decided once the subject was decided

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.250 
was decided once the subject was decided
not<00:03:09.040> very<00:03:10.030> much<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.359> that<00:03:10.510> she<00:03:10.599> would<00:03:10.720> make<00:03:10.900> one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
not very much so that she would make one

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.559 
not very much so that she would make one
single<00:03:11.560> work<00:03:11.709> which<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.700> an<00:03:12.970> extended

within this thinking group other

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.250 
within this thinking group other
invitations<00:04:06.670> have<00:04:06.849> snowboards<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.720> as<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
invitations have snowboards and as a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.559 
invitations have snowboards and as a
result<00:04:08.680> 70<00:04:09.579> people<00:04:09.849> were<00:04:09.940> invited

so these 70 people move the majority of
them<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.319> would<00:04:14.470> say<00:04:14.500> almost<00:04:14.739> 100%<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.489> them

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
them I would say almost 100% of them

and<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:43.850> something<00:04:44.060> which<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.210> quite

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
and this is something which is quite

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.520 
and this is something which is quite
characteristic<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:45.170> daughter's<00:04:45.380> work

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
characteristic and daughter's work

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.110 
characteristic and daughter's work
you're<00:04:45.710> never<00:04:45.830> quite<00:04:46.040> sure<00:04:46.070> whether<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.970> is

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
you're never quite sure whether this is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.640 
you're never quite sure whether this is
something<00:04:47.210> which<00:04:47.510> has<00:04:47.540> been<00:04:47.630> improvised<00:04:48.260> or

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
something which has been improvised or

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.920 
something which has been improvised or
which<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:50.000> know<00:04:50.120> totally<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.690> kind<00:04:50.870> of

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
which is you know totally it kind of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.960 
which is you know totally it kind of
scripted<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.710> precise<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.490> think<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:52.820> is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
scripted and precise and I think this is

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.560 
scripted and precise and I think this is
what<00:04:53.390> makes<00:04:53.570> very<00:04:54.050> often<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.980> work<00:04:55.460> very

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
what makes very often I work very

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.640 
what makes very often I work very
interesting<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.690> dynamic<00:04:56.810> because<00:04:57.350> she's

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
interesting and dynamic because she's

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.440 
interesting and dynamic because she's
very<00:04:57.860> clear<00:04:58.190> about<00:04:58.370> her<00:04:58.520> ideas<00:04:58.670> very<00:04:59.090> precise

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
very clear about her ideas very precise

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.850 
very clear about her ideas very precise
in<00:04:59.480> her<00:04:59.660> structure<00:05:00.110> but<00:05:00.230> she<00:05:00.380> allows<00:05:00.650> an

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
in her structure but she allows an

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.470 
in her structure but she allows an
incredible<00:05:01.250> amount<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.580> space<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.300> freedom

incredible amount of space and freedom

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.260 
incredible amount of space and freedom
for<00:05:03.170> improvisation<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.160> for<00:05:04.580> other<00:05:04.760> sort<00:05:05.210> of
