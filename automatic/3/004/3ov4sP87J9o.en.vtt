prefer not to have any jumping but this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.509 
prefer not to have any jumping but this
damn<00:02:08.700> thing<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.000> ok<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:09.840> aggressive

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.600 

and<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:13.670> comes<00:02:13.909> with<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> nice<00:02:15.280> kite<00:02:16.280> egg<00:02:16.459> sheet

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
and it comes with a nice kite egg sheet

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:28.449 
and it comes with a nice kite egg sheet
with<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> black<00:02:20.180> ball<00:02:21.079> chain<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.650> tried<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
with a black ball chain so I tried to

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.710 
with a black ball chain so I tried to
put<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> knife<00:02:29.000> into<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:30.170> sheet<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
put a knife into the sheet and I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.680 
put a knife into the sheet and I
couldn't<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.340> thought<00:02:37.730> maybe<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.329> fit<00:02:38.540> is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
couldn't so I thought maybe the fit is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.399 
couldn't so I thought maybe the fit is
too<00:02:38.870> tight

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
too tight

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.910 
too tight
this<00:02:40.129> can<00:02:40.310> happen<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.700> course<00:02:41.409> then<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:42.439> pushed

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
this can happen of course then I pushed

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.990 
this can happen of course then I pushed
on<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.579> handle<00:02:43.939> slabs<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:46.190> could<00:02:46.459> actually

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
on the handle slabs and I could actually

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.660 
on the handle slabs and I could actually
put<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.049> bit<00:02:48.319> more<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:48.890> still<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.340> far

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
put it in a bit more but still not far

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.259 
put it in a bit more but still not far
enough<00:02:49.849> I<00:02:50.409> even<00:02:51.409> checked<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.010> Internet<00:02:52.609> the

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
enough I even checked the Internet the

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.360 
enough I even checked the Internet the
YouTube<00:02:53.659> videos<00:02:54.049> on<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.349> internet<00:02:54.590> again<00:02:55.129> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
YouTube videos on the internet again to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.399 
YouTube videos on the internet again to
see<00:02:55.579> how<00:02:55.819> far<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.269> knife<00:02:56.420> actually<00:02:56.720> has<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.260> go

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
see how far the knife actually has to go

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.270 
see how far the knife actually has to go
inside<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.340> Kydex<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.530> noticed<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.129> it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
inside the Kydex and I noticed that it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.539 
inside the Kydex and I noticed that it
has<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:01.730> any<00:03:02.440> further<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.680> bit<00:03:03.799> further

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
has to go any further a bit further

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.420 
has to go any further a bit further
inside<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.879> is<00:03:08.000> now<00:03:08.120> good<00:03:08.329> retention<00:03:09.430> but

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
inside so this is now good retention but

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.309 
inside so this is now good retention but
I<00:03:11.379> thought<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:12.409> check<00:03:12.829> first<00:03:13.069> what's<00:03:13.430> wrong

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
I thought I check first what's wrong

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.300 
I thought I check first what's wrong
before<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.349> force<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.069> knife<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:17.919> so<00:03:18.919> I<00:03:18.949> checked

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
before I force a knife in so I checked

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.300 
before I force a knife in so I checked
the<00:03:21.069> opening<00:03:22.069> in<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> Kydex<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:25.099> looked

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the opening in the Kydex but that looked

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.580 
the opening in the Kydex but that looked
all<00:03:25.519> okay<00:03:25.879> so<00:03:27.849> there<00:03:28.849> must<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.470> lot<00:03:30.470> of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
all okay so there must be a lot of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.839 
all okay so there must be a lot of
reason<00:03:30.949> why<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.639> won't<00:03:31.879> fit<00:03:33.400> then<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.549> checked

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
reason why it won't fit then I checked

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.680 
reason why it won't fit then I checked
the<00:03:34.970> handle<00:03:35.810> slaps<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:36.910> noticed<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.150> saw<00:03:38.449> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
the handle slaps and I noticed I saw a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.550 
the handle slaps and I noticed I saw a
little<00:03:38.989> gap<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.590> between<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.989> blank<00:03:41.989> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
little gap in between the blank the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.000 
little gap in between the blank the
blade<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.609> handle<00:03:43.639> slaps<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.889> don't<00:03:45.889> know

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
blade and the handle slaps I don't know

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.539 
blade and the handle slaps I don't know
if<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.310> camera<00:03:46.639> will<00:03:47.030> pick<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.389> up<00:03:48.549> but

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
if the camera will pick it up but

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.650 
if the camera will pick it up but
there's<00:03:49.819> a<00:03:49.910> small<00:03:50.359> gap<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:52.160> actually<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:53.480> can

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
there's a small gap and actually you can

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.740 
there's a small gap and actually you can
hear<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:56.199> this<00:03:57.199> is<00:03:57.379> me<00:03:57.500> pushing<00:03:58.389> not<00:03:59.389> too<00:03:59.540> hard

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
hear it this is me pushing not too hard

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.690 
hear it this is me pushing not too hard
just<00:04:00.079> pushing<00:04:00.829> on<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.760> handle<00:04:02.090> slaps

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.550 

that's<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.420> noise<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.750> makes<00:04:07.780> because<00:04:08.230> it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
that's the noise it makes because it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.780 
that's the noise it makes because it
it's<00:04:09.550> not<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> tight<00:04:10.420> fit<00:04:11.580> well<00:04:12.580> if<00:04:12.670> this

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
it's not not a tight fit well if this

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.240 
it's not not a tight fit well if this
was<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.030> 20<00:04:13.510> euro<00:04:13.750> knife<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.319> would<00:04:14.500> probably<00:04:14.709> put

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
was a 20 euro knife I would probably put

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.069 
was a 20 euro knife I would probably put
some<00:04:15.520> strong<00:04:16.030> glue<00:04:16.209> drape<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.200> in-between<00:04:19.079> put

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
some strong glue drape it in-between put

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.100 
some strong glue drape it in-between put
it<00:04:20.200> in<00:04:20.350> some<00:04:21.040> sort<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.489> clamp<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:22.180> leave<00:04:22.960> it

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
it in some sort of a clamp and leave it

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.800 
it in some sort of a clamp and leave it
there<00:04:23.140> for<00:04:23.320> one<00:04:23.650> day<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.160> we'll<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.460> fixed<00:04:24.910> but

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
there for one day and we'll be fixed but

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.680 
there for one day and we'll be fixed but
this<00:04:26.050> being<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.440> 46<00:04:27.010> year<00:04:27.190> old<00:04:27.220> knife<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.850> think

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
this being a 46 year old knife I think

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
this being a 46 year old knife I think
it's<00:04:28.840> too<00:04:28.960> expensive<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.530> have<00:04:29.860> these<00:04:30.160> kinds

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's too expensive to have these kinds

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.760 
it's too expensive to have these kinds
of<00:04:30.580> this<00:04:31.060> kind<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.360> mistake<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:34.410> as<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.530> said<00:04:35.590> I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
of this kind of mistake and as I said I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.550 
of this kind of mistake and as I said I
have<00:04:36.669> reviewed<00:04:37.150> auto-backup<00:04:37.570> +<00:04:37.960> knives<00:04:38.230> and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
have reviewed auto-backup + knives and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.409 
have reviewed auto-backup + knives and
I've<00:04:38.680> never<00:04:38.980> seen<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.820> on<00:04:40.240> any<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.720> them<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.169> I

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419

because<00:05:18.280> actually<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.700> lost<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.419> bit<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.110> my

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
because actually I lost a bit of my

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.340 
because actually I lost a bit of my
confidence<00:05:20.979> in<00:05:21.250> this<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:22.360> wider<00:05:22.600> handle

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
confidence in this the wider handle

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.219 
confidence in this the wider handle
slabs<00:05:23.620> are<00:05:24.400> secured<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.410> blade

slabs are secured to the to the blade

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.010 
slabs are secured to the to the blade
now<00:05:29.229> I<00:05:29.470> think<00:05:29.919> even<00:05:30.310> if<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:30.610> if<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.880> get<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.390> good

now I think even if you if I get a good

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.440 
now I think even if you if I get a good
one<00:05:32.200> at<00:05:32.950> first<00:05:33.280> in<00:05:33.790> time<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:35.620> same<00:05:35.860> problem

will happend so I'm going to choose

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:48.840 
will happend so I'm going to choose

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
something else ok this was again the

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.710 
something else ok this was again the
sound<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.419> the<00:05:49.570> handle<00:05:49.840> slabs<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:52.300> it's<00:05:52.450> a<00:05:52.510> pity

sound of the handle slabs so it's a pity

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.810 
sound of the handle slabs so it's a pity
