00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.050 
know take the sorry about that you could
just<00:03:08.650> take<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.980> instead<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.640> adding<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> little

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
just take a instead of adding a little

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300 
just take a instead of adding a little
stone<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.750> take<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.440> gunpowder<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.190> put

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
stone you can take the gunpowder and put

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.360 
stone you can take the gunpowder and put
that<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.549> there<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.440> next<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.130> need<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that in there but next we need a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.680 
that in there but next we need a
fermented<00:03:15.850> spider<00:03:15.940> eyes<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.390> we're<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.630> to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
fermented spider eyes so we're going to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.320 
fermented spider eyes so we're going to
take<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.049> sugar<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:18.070> brown<00:03:18.220> mushroom<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
take the sugar the brown mushroom and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.360 
take the sugar the brown mushroom and
the<00:03:20.140> spider<00:03:20.410> eye<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.890> we're<00:03:21.070> going<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> make<00:03:21.340> a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the spider eye and we're going to make a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.770 
the spider eye and we're going to make a
fermented<00:03:21.910> spot<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.360> here

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
fermented spot right here

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.880 
fermented spot right here
and<00:03:23.700> with<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.870> see<00:03:26.170> we<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.290> functional

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and with that we see we have functional

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.210 
and with that we see we have functional
poison<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.459> with<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.030> glowstone<00:03:28.650> gives<00:03:29.650> 22

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
poison to with the glowstone gives 22

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.630 
poison to with the glowstone gives 22
seconds<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.470> poison<00:03:32.470> I'm<00:03:33.070> pretty<00:03:33.280> sure<00:03:33.459> it's<00:03:33.580> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
seconds of poison I'm pretty sure it's a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.630 
seconds of poison I'm pretty sure it's a
stronger<00:03:33.850> poison<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.950> have<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.100> fermented

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
stronger poison we have a fermented

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.729 
stronger poison we have a fermented
spider<00:03:36.760> right<00:03:37.120> here<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.040> will<00:03:39.130> give<00:03:39.310> us

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
spider right here and that will give us

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.449 
spider right here and that will give us
the<00:03:41.739> potion<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.160> humming<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:44.070> which<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.280> then
