on this one let's concentrate on this

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.800 
on this one let's concentrate on this
end<00:02:52.830> first<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:53.400> we've<00:02:53.550> got<00:02:53.730> 2<00:02:54.030> USB<00:02:54.300> power

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
end first of all we've got 2 USB power

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.199 
end first of all we've got 2 USB power
sockets<00:02:55.230> we've<00:02:55.769> got<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> set<00:02:56.250> button<00:02:56.489> we've

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
sockets we've got a set button we've

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.180 
sockets we've got a set button we've
also<00:02:57.360> got<00:02:57.720> some<00:02:57.750> telephone<00:02:58.350> sockets<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:59.010> well

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
also got some telephone sockets as well

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.640 
also got some telephone sockets as well
and<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.970> two<00:03:00.180> outs<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.319> can<00:03:01.440> plug<00:03:01.620> your

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
and in and two outs so you can plug your

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.160 
and in and two outs so you can plug your
main<00:03:02.280> telephone<00:03:02.640> line<00:03:03.000> into<00:03:03.300> here<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.690> then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
main telephone line into here and then

main telephone line into here and then
to<00:03:04.530> telecom<00:03:05.100> devices<00:03:05.610> coming<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.209> there

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
to telecom devices coming out and there

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.870 
to telecom devices coming out and there
be<00:03:06.630> search<00:03:06.930> protected<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:07.680> well<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.730> then

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
be search protected as well and then

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.790 
be search protected as well and then
moving<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.569> source<00:03:09.810> central<00:03:10.319> section

this is really nice we've got a master

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.940 
this is really nice we've got a master
socket<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.670> then<00:03:15.300> five<00:03:15.780> slave<00:03:16.260> sockets<00:03:16.769> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
socket and then five slave sockets and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340 
socket and then five slave sockets and
these<00:03:17.040> are<00:03:17.190> all<00:03:17.370> surge<00:03:17.700> protected<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.660> what

these are all surge protected and what

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.860 
these are all surge protected and what
this<00:03:19.530> device<00:03:19.680> does<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.310> detects<00:03:20.820> when<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
master device is turned off so you turn

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.449 
master device is turned off so you turn
off<00:03:24.329> whatever<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> connected<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.350> here<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:25.950> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
off whatever is connected to here and it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.009 
off whatever is connected to here and it
cuts<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> powers<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.360> all<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.600> these<00:03:27.720> devices

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
cuts the powers of all of these devices

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.259 
cuts the powers of all of these devices
as<00:03:28.380> well<00:03:28.560> absolutely<00:03:29.459> fantastic

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
as well absolutely fantastic

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.520

Nazz<00:03:35.070> device<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.780> turn<00:03:37.019> your

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
Nazz device and then you turn your

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.560 
Nazz device and then you turn your
computer<00:03:37.230> off<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:38.340> saves<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.790> some<00:03:38.910> energy<00:03:39.360> in

computer off it saves you some energy in
terms<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.049> all<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.410> these<00:03:40.560> devices<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:41.250> well

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
terms of all of these devices as well

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.729 
terms of all of these devices as well
and<00:03:41.880> then<00:03:42.359> on<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.570> end<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:43.049> we've<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.620> an

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
and then on the end here we've got an

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.650 
and then on the end here we've got an
additional<00:03:44.190> two<00:03:44.340> sockets<00:03:44.640> these<00:03:45.450> are

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
additional two sockets these are

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.690 
additional two sockets these are
standard<00:03:46.140> sockets<00:03:46.620> they're<00:03:46.799> always<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
standard sockets they're always on and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.000 
standard sockets they're always on and
it<00:03:48.630> means<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.989> can<00:03:49.109> plug<00:03:49.320> in<00:03:49.470> things<00:03:49.739> like<00:03:49.859> a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
it means you can plug in things like a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.979 
it means you can plug in things like a
television<00:03:50.519> or<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> set-top<00:03:51.390> box<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.930> you

these<00:03:54.269> two<00:03:54.600> top<00:03:54.840> sockets<00:03:55.260> we've<00:03:55.799> also<00:03:55.920> got

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
these two top sockets we've also got

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.979 
these two top sockets we've also got
some<00:03:56.220> LED<00:03:56.730> lights<00:03:56.760> here<00:03:57.090> as<00:03:57.329> well<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.720> power
