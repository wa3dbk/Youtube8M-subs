00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.680
 world papers which you modify for 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 so to be able to put several skins of root 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 put about referring to ironman and for 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.880

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 theme as you already know the download link 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.070
 I will leave them in the description of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 video as it is good habit no more 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.989
 let's start now once we have 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.289
 downloaded the file in radio point what 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 have if we want on the desktop 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.860
 we will start to click with secondary on 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 the file in radio point we will give in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.699
 extract here which will leave you a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.859
 folder with the files that we will occupy 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.899
 which when we open it we see all the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.540
 folders that contain the files that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 I had previously commented 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.950
 Well the first to occupy will be the subject 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.870
 from ironman which we will see two files 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 inside the folder and we select them 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.540
 we give secondary and copy now let's 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 go to our local disk ce let's go to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 the windows folder 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.820
 we will look for the folder called re source 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.600
 when we enter we will see the folder of the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.240
 issues and we enter it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.060
 and there we will paste the subject in a space in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.280
 White 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.899
 and we will give permission to complete the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 transfer of files and 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.790
 we wait a bit in what it ends 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.140
 already once the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.120
 transfer we will see that they have already been 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.520
 and we will apply it not before 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.470
 tell them that I have football activated 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.940
 that I'll still leave them with the subject 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.490
 to apply it once 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.740
 installed theme and also ironman 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.170
 they know how to apply a theme now as 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.970
 you will notice in the menu of topics we are going to go to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.860
 the section of topics installed in the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 which will be the theme that we just 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.300
 to put in our system and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.220
 we just clicked it so that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.740
 is applied in our system 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.750
 well now as we noticed is the theme 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.000
 applied and when going checking we'll see that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.010
 has different wallpapers 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 very eye-catching as the interface 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.820
 the colors go well according to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.800
 theme also shows us a great 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.810
 variety of visual options such as 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.200
 are the wallpapers within the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 folders as we will see in a moment 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.680
 likewise the part of the start menu with 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 funds also like in the color 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.580
 of the typography changes it to a blue and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.350
 to go see more things checando 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 make this ironman theme a good 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 theme in its kind as well as going 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 moving some window that we have in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.020
 background we will notice that it has 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.510
 a good view inside the window that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.310
 we are now seeing the next thing that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.380
 I will do is put the wallpapers that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 I will also leave you in file in point 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.120
 rare to change the view to 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.300
 desk as you know we only mark 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.620
 the images and we will give secondary 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.600
 we will choose the option of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.630
 set as wallpaper for 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.370
 so the changes are applied now 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.110
 and only I show you both the bar 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.090
 rocks already placed as well as 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.370
 skins of rain meter on the desk and 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.940
 also the player in allusion 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.940
 Hombre de Hierro 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 as you will see this is the rock bar 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.460
 already with the modified bar to a style 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.560
 of ironman as you will see 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.540
 inside the text I put the logo of 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.280
 ironman as in the part of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.230
 down will be the image of the avengers 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.240
 and also the icons that have been 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.520
 created with reference to the subject have the 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.410
 reflection in the bottom part I hope that 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.410
 in the same way this one is to your liking 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.250
 now as you will see rain meter is already 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.250
 installed with several skins allusive to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.110
 ironman as I also commented 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.970
 that these are some of those that I will put 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.950
 obviously they contain many more skins 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.830
 to customize the desktop to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.990
 our taste now within the skins 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.170
 As we will see, they have several options 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.180
 in color so that you can put the skin of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.150
 our liking in some color either in 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.100
 green red or blue as 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.950
 let's create our screen of 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.080
 Desktop according to our taste 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.120
 that's what I left the wallpapers for 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.180
 so the skins of rain are more visible 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.010
 put in as well as we will see there is a skin 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.840
 which we will edit to make it so 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.720
 fully functional to our 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.400
 system as we will see later on 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.140
 I remember that in my channel will be the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.120
 tutorial videos to be able to 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.460
 download and install the rocker bar 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.590
 dock likewise also king stick in his 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.450
 portable version or installation and how 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.130
 make our own skins just like 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.050
 that the installation and skins of 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.740
 reproductive system as we will see in about 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.740
 more moments 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.400
 now as we will see in this skin of rain 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.379
 meter shows us our system in 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.449
 shortcuts which we will have 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.639
 to modify in the text to be 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.500
 functional for this we are going to give 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.719
 secondary on the skin and we will puncture 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.520
 where it says edit skin so that 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.409
 open us the notebook where we will see 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.439
 all the features with which 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.240
 count the skin for this we will look for the 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.460
 option of buttons in which below 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.319
 every information we will see the routes in 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.389
 which we will put the route of our 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.550
 things for example as we see already had 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.979
 a modified one which is misspelled 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.990
 and therefore it will not work but if 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.360
 we change the route of the documents of 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.000
 the one that comes from ce user iron-man 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.740
 documents in which we will replace the 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.900
 part of ironman to our name 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.849
 or as we have it in my case of migueli 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.860
 we will close the document which 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.740
 will ask us if we want to save the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.690
 changes and we will give that if soon what 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.669
 what we do will be to refresh the skin or if 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.529
 we want all the skins we have in 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.689
 the desk following the same steps 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.639
 of secondary on the skin by choosing 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.710
 cool skin or we go to the option of 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.360
 root and we will give in to refresh everything and 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.860
 ready now our access to the 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.900
 documents is working 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.669
 now I will only go to put the 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.650
 reproductive system that shows us the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.409
 ironman face with a very interface 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.509
 simple to occupy as I mentioned 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.520
 previously the download link will be 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.169
 in the description of the video and like 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.229
 I continue to check my channel there 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.780
 will be more tutorials more good this has 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.240
