00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
you're pretty much zigs if you is just

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.059 
you're pretty much zigs if you is just
physical<00:01:19.490> damage<00:01:19.819> with<00:01:19.939> no<00:01:20.060> spells<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:21.859> had

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
physical damage with no spells so we had

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.730 
physical damage with no spells so we had
them<00:01:22.280> visualize<00:01:23.149> every<00:01:23.689> unit<00:01:24.170> on<00:01:24.319> the<00:01:24.560> map

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
them visualize every unit on the map

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.639 
them visualize every unit on the map
every<00:01:25.280> creep<00:01:25.579> every<00:01:25.999> hero<00:01:26.359> every<00:01:26.929> tower<00:01:27.259> as<00:01:27.619> a

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
every creep every hero every tower as a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.270 
every creep every hero every tower as a
turret<00:01:28.100> or<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.670> parent<00:01:29.179> redundant<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.280> we

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
turret or the parent redundant so we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.550 
turret or the parent redundant so we
feel<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:31.549> that's<00:01:31.759> increased<00:01:32.299> his<00:01:32.659> play<00:01:33.020> his

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
feel like that's increased his play his

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.899 
feel like that's increased his play his
level<00:01:33.859> of<00:01:33.920> play<00:01:34.100> because<00:01:34.399> all<00:01:34.609> he<00:01:34.759> thinks

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
level of play because all he thinks

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.459 
level of play because all he thinks
about<00:01:35.090> right<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:35.509> is<00:01:35.659> just<00:01:35.840> killing<00:01:36.139> turrets

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
about right now is just killing turrets

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.559 
about right now is just killing turrets
if<00:01:36.590> there's<00:01:36.740> ten<00:01:36.950> ten<00:01:37.670> creeps<00:01:38.240> on<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.420> map

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
if there's ten ten creeps on the map

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.629 
if there's ten ten creeps on the map
that's<00:01:38.719> ten<00:01:38.990> turrets<00:01:39.319> from<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.619> kill<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.219> he's

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
that's ten turrets from the kill so he's

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.660 
that's ten turrets from the kill so he's
got<00:01:40.819> a<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.030> easy<00:01:41.299> answer<00:01:41.869> now<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.770> how<00:01:43.609> do

got a really easy answer now so how do
you<00:01:43.850> weigh<00:01:44.299> in<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.899> dragon<00:01:45.499> vs.<00:01:45.979> taking

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
you weigh in the dragon vs. taking

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.699 
you weigh in the dragon vs. taking
turrets<00:01:47.299> because<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:47.959> guys<00:01:48.139> went<00:01:48.439> for<00:01:48.560> two

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
turrets because you guys went for two

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.919 
turrets because you guys went for two
turrets<00:01:48.950> top<00:01:49.280> give<00:01:49.909> up<00:01:50.119> one<00:01:50.450> bottom<00:01:50.780> turret

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
turrets top give up one bottom turret

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.169 
turrets top give up one bottom turret
and<00:01:51.109> one<00:01:51.289> dragon<00:01:51.829> would<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.579> take<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.850> every

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
and one dragon would you take that every

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.489 
and one dragon would you take that every
day<00:01:53.329> we'd<00:01:53.630> probably<00:01:53.810> take<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.170> every<00:01:54.350> time

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
day we'd probably take that every time

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.889 
day we'd probably take that every time
like<00:01:54.649> even<00:01:54.920> if<00:01:55.069> dragon<00:01:55.520> gave<00:01:55.729> more<00:01:56.600> golden

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
like even if dragon gave more golden

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.480 
like even if dragon gave more golden
does<00:01:57.139> now<00:01:57.319> we<00:01:57.649> would<00:01:57.829> still<00:01:58.159> think<00:01:58.310> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
does now we would still think the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.919 
does now we would still think the
additional<00:01:58.880> map<00:01:58.999> pressure<00:01:59.209> is<00:01:59.509> just<00:01:59.779> huge

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
additional map pressure is just huge

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.660 
additional map pressure is just huge
like<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.319> lets<00:02:00.499> us<00:02:00.709> be<00:02:01.100> able<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.340> make<00:02:01.459> plays

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
like it lets us be able to make plays

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.209 
like it lets us be able to make plays
and<00:02:01.969> that's<00:02:02.149> really<00:02:02.420> what<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:02.719> wanted<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.020> do

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
and that's really what we wanted to do

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.289 
and that's really what we wanted to do
alright<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:04.340> then<00:02:04.459> actually<00:02:04.789> let's<00:02:05.029> get<00:02:05.179> into

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
alright so then actually let's get into

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.459 
alright so then actually let's get into
some<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.810> plays<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.109> guys<00:02:06.229> made

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
some of the plays you guys made

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.800 
some of the plays you guys made
throughout<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.950> game<00:02:07.100> mid<00:02:07.759> lane<00:02:08.030> about<00:02:08.509> 20

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
throughout the game mid lane about 20

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.449 
throughout the game mid lane about 20
minutes<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.410> guys<00:02:09.560> took<00:02:09.830> mid<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.250> hitter

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
minutes in you guys took mid and hitter

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.800 
minutes in you guys took mid and hitter
and<00:02:10.550> took<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> big<00:02:10.849> team<00:02:11.060> fight<00:02:11.240> off<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.630> we

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and took a big team fight off of that we

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.390 
and took a big team fight off of that we
have<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.959> replay<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> he's<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> walk

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
have a replay of that he's going to walk

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160 
have a replay of that he's going to walk
us<00:02:13.580> through<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:13.819> happened<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.450> pretty<00:02:14.990> big

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
us through what happened in a pretty big

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.680 
us through what happened in a pretty big
game<00:02:15.380> changing<00:02:15.800> fight<00:02:15.980> here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
game changing fight here

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.830 
game changing fight here
uh<00:02:19.030> there's<00:02:20.030> nothing<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.450> we're<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:20.630> see

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
uh there's nothing here we're just see

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840 
uh there's nothing here we're just see
gene<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.170> know<00:02:21.320> we're<00:02:21.500> ahead<00:02:21.590> right<00:02:21.950> now<00:02:21.980> by<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
gene we know we're ahead right now by a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.520 
gene we know we're ahead right now by a
considerable<00:02:23.690> amount<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:24.080> knew<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:24.350> had<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
considerable amount we knew they had to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.020 
considerable amount we knew they had to
engage<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.250> Layla<00:02:25.520> was<00:02:25.610> coming<00:02:25.820> from<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
engage and Layla was coming from the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.570 
engage and Layla was coming from the
back<00:02:26.180> as<00:02:27.140> soon<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.680> they<00:02:27.800> stacked<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.430> me

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
back as soon as they stacked up on me

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
back as soon as they stacked up on me
here<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.090> knew<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> game<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.810> over<00:02:29.990> because<00:02:30.260> we

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
here I knew the game was over because we

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.080 
here I knew the game was over because we
got<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> full<00:02:30.920> minefield<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.610> three-man

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
got a full minefield in the three-man

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.810 
got a full minefield in the three-man
jinx<00:02:32.390> rocket<00:02:32.780> as<00:02:33.080> soon<00:02:33.350> as<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.620> hit<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
jinx rocket as soon as that hit like the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.100 
jinx rocket as soon as that hit like the
problem<00:02:35.240> with<00:02:35.330> their<00:02:35.450> comp<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.840> they<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.020> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
problem with their comp is they have to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.170 
problem with their comp is they have to
stack<00:02:36.380> up<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.040> us<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.460> as<00:02:37.880> long<00:02:38.030> as

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
stack up on top of us and as long as

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.580 
stack up on top of us and as long as
they're<00:02:38.330> not<00:02:38.360> ahead<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:38.960> fine<00:02:39.050> or<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.470> long

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
they're not ahead that's fine or as long

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.590 
they're not ahead that's fine or as long
as<00:02:39.710> they're<00:02:39.800> not<00:02:39.860> split<00:02:40.160> pushing<00:02:40.370> us<00:02:40.600> that's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
as they're not split pushing us that's

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.270 
as they're not split pushing us that's
fine<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.020> as<00:02:42.110> soon<00:02:42.260> as<00:02:42.350> they<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.070> stack

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
fine but as soon as they have to stack

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
fine but as soon as they have to stack
up<00:02:43.490> they<00:02:43.790> eat<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.240> our<00:02:44.510> Alwyn<00:02:44.930> they<00:02:45.050> just

up they eat all of our Alwyn they just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.560 
up they eat all of our Alwyn they just
exploded<00:02:45.590> into<00:02:45.860> pieces<00:02:46.240> so<00:02:47.240> I<00:02:47.270> just<00:02:47.360> want<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
pushing as long as they have to stack up

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.160 
pushing as long as they have to stack up
how<00:02:51.740> did<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:51.950> guys<00:02:52.180> draw<00:02:53.180> EG<00:02:53.660> than<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.990> just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
how did you guys draw EG than in just

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.990 
how did you guys draw EG than in just
stacking<00:02:54.380> up<00:02:54.560> against<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:54.950> guys<00:02:55.100> uh<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
stacking up against you guys uh the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 
stacking up against you guys uh the
early<00:02:56.240> church<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.660> helped<00:02:56.960> because<00:02:57.110> they

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
early church really helped because they

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.170 
early church really helped because they
helped<00:02:58.250> us<00:02:58.310> establish<00:02:58.490> a<00:02:58.880> lot<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.060> that

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
helped us establish a lot of that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.970 
helped us establish a lot of that
pressure<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.720> we<00:03:00.200> were<00:03:00.290> able<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.500> get<00:03:00.620> really

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
pressure and we were able to get really

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
pressure and we were able to get really
good<00:03:01.070> deep<00:03:01.280> Ward<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.700> we're<00:03:01.820> able<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.120> see<00:03:02.270> like

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
good deep Ward so we're able to see like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.060 
good deep Ward so we're able to see like
all<00:03:02.600> their<00:03:02.780> potential<00:03:03.350> gank<00:03:03.530> routes<00:03:03.770> and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
all their potential gank routes and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.830 
all their potential gank routes and
because<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.180> were<00:03:05.330> able<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.690> just

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
because of that we were able to just

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.540 
because of that we were able to just
choose<00:03:06.440> which<00:03:06.650> objectively<00:03:07.070> wanted<00:03:07.400> like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
choose which objectively wanted like

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.490 
choose which objectively wanted like
which<00:03:07.700> dragon<00:03:07.970> which<00:03:08.210> turn<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.840> all<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.350> that

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
which dragon which turn and all of that

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.290 
which dragon which turn and all of that
and<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.800> able<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.070> just<00:03:10.160> take<00:03:10.370> very<00:03:11.000> clean

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
and be able to just take very clean

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.000 
and be able to just take very clean
fights<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.410> ended<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.830> game<00:03:12.980> with

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
fights like if we ended the game with

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.430 
fights like if we ended the game with
zero<00:03:13.370> kills<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.850> would<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.060> been<00:03:14.150> fine<00:03:14.300> but<00:03:14.780> we

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
zero kills I would have been fine but we

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.780 
zero kills I would have been fine but we
knew<00:03:15.560> they<00:03:15.710> eventually<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.250> force<00:03:16.520> on<00:03:16.640> in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
knew they eventually at the force on in

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.250 
knew they eventually at the force on in
on<00:03:16.910> us<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.270> long<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.600> played<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.960> out<00:03:18.050> well

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
on us as long as we played it out well

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.410 
on us as long as we played it out well
we'd<00:03:18.710> be<00:03:18.830> able<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.070> win<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> game<00:03:19.280> was<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.360> a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
we'd be able to win the game was that a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420 
we'd be able to win the game was that a
factor<00:03:20.960> in<00:03:21.170> your<00:03:21.530> zigs<00:03:21.920> bill<00:03:22.100> because<00:03:22.370> you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
factor in your zigs bill because you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.949 
factor in your zigs bill because you
didn't<00:03:22.580> go<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.970> defensive<00:03:23.270> item<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
didn't go with a defensive item and you

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.090 
didn't go with a defensive item and you
knew<00:03:24.110> like<00:03:24.320> if<00:03:24.500> they<00:03:24.650> were<00:03:24.680> all<00:03:24.890> going<00:03:25.040> to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
knew like if they were all going to

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.680 
knew like if they were all going to
collapse<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.610> then<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.150> guys<00:03:26.360> would<00:03:26.540> get

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
collapse on you then you guys would get

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.810 
collapse on you then you guys would get
AoE<00:03:26.959> damage<00:03:27.050> off<00:03:27.500> or<00:03:27.709> was<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:27.920> like<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.489> lane

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
AoE damage off or was that like a lane

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.150 
AoE damage off or was that like a lane

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
build that you were I think that zigs
