00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.190
 small points of difference 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.890
 the absence of the current art tropez stable 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.309
 ranking leader has sharpened the appetite 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 competitors they are 76 engaged in 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.409

 as usual we try to improve 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.369
 the welcome of the riders 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.259
 so this year we have a lot more 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.530
 boxing that last year's career 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.810
 redone like every year 3rd year so 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.710
 it's starting to get easier we're going 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 to say we are 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.030
 makes a weekend of more contests not 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.360

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.900
 track assembly composed of 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.400

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.540
 been helped at the paddock of things that do not 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.480
 do not usually do 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.400
 at the turn of the aisles the public will have been able 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.760

 beautiful course jumping on 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.700

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.590
 nice story also to manage from 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 the team between the horse and the rider 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.080
 and it's nice to discover 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.920
 victorious in 2012 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.110

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.150

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.850
 cluny 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.290
 this is the first time I go I have 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.330
 made a grand prize of the grand national 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.890
 a doctor when and with which lady 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.670
 I get them back at the beginning of the year it was 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.370
 my father who climbed it up to 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.450
 when it's a very good mare 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.100
 very energetic 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.440
 so it's true that sometimes it's 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.480
 difficult to contain it I put a 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.730
 I put a little time in the beginning 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.250
 of year to put me with I did 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.640
 several meters 45 so here I am 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:53.380
 throw a little bit so so that was a 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.670
 last we won the cures said that 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.350
 win the big national 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.140

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.240
 like to regain the big national 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.680

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.590
 of her we will try to do the best 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.820
 possible I think we have a good 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.410
 luck this year may not be for 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.770
 win but we really have to aim 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.640
 the podium 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.780
 he is I think the two one two 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.489
 three four all stupid 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.200
 you know you have to get on well 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.200
 more from the beginning it's not easy 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.100
 thirteen couples on the seventy-one 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.900
 will succeed in overcoming the pitfalls 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.800
 of the route drawn by jean françois 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.540
 morand the track leader ugo brol does 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.460
 part of these without fail at the first 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.050
 but with 4 points he does not 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.050
 will not finish in the first eight 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.330
 marie robert with you pov ' duluc 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.360

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.480
 and a second and 76 hundredths 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.350
 at that moment everyone thinks that 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.350
 the grand prize is played 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.240

 michel passet just before me so I 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.080
 considering that he had set the bar quite high 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.520
 so 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.439
 I had to take all the risks for 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.520
 to win this event that's what 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.699
 I did then it paid
