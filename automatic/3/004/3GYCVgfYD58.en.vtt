00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
all right this is my 86 EFI engine I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.640 
all right this is my 86 EFI engine I
converted<00:00:08.910> over<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:11.000> just<00:00:12.000> use<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.320> same<00:00:13.320> heads

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
converted over I just use my same heads

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.120 
converted over I just use my same heads
there<00:00:14.809> didn't<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> problem<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
there didn't have a problem with that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.519 
there didn't have a problem with that
I<00:00:20.960> believe<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.109> lied<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:24.529> building

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I believe I lied I think the building

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.950 
I believe I lied I think the building
exhaust<00:00:26.130> port

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
exhaust port

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.419 
exhaust port
you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.080> somewhere<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> head<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.250> think

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
you know somewhere on the head I think

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.240 
you know somewhere on the head I think
it's<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.670> backside<00:00:30.619> now<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.009> have

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
it's on the backside now that you have

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's on the backside now that you have
to<00:00:32.520> fly<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:33.390> else<00:00:33.570> you'll<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.840> leaking

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to fly there else you'll be leaking

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.880 
to fly there else you'll be leaking
exhaust<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.630> it'll<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.020> many

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
exhaust out you know it'll be like many

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
exhaust out you know it'll be like many
straight<00:00:38.250> pipes<00:00:38.520> will<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.030> stupid

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
straight pipes will be kind of stupid

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.740 
straight pipes will be kind of stupid
sounding<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> manifold<00:00:42.510> went<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.020> on

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
sounding so the manifold went right on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.040 
sounding so the manifold went right on
but<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.710> seemed<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.219> though<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.780> kind

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
but it seemed as though that it had kind

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
but it seemed as though that it had kind
of<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> gap<00:00:49.850> between<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of more of a gap between it and the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
of more of a gap between it and the
actual<00:00:51.899> block<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> heads<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.420> just

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
actual block not the heads but just

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
actual block not the heads but just
something<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
something kind of I don't really know so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
something kind of I don't really know so
I<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.510> extra<00:00:57.780> gasket<00:00:58.289> sealer

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I just put a little extra gasket sealer

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.760 
I just put a little extra gasket sealer
and<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> huge<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.489> runs<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.770> maybe

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and there not a huge it runs like maybe

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.250 
and there not a huge it runs like maybe
20,000<00:01:02.609> seven-inch<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.110> bit

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
20,000 seven-inch some just a little bit

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.520 
20,000 seven-inch some just a little bit
more<00:01:04.439> hardly<00:01:04.920> noticeable<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:07.290> goes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
more hardly noticeable but that goes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.450 
more hardly noticeable but that goes
together<00:01:07.710> pretty<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
together pretty good

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.060 
together pretty good
I<00:01:08.729> got<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.610> 65<00:01:11.610> mechanical<00:01:12.390> distributor

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
I got a just a 65 mechanical distributor

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.730 
I got a just a 65 mechanical distributor
goes<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.170> sure<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.439> could

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
goes right in you know I'm sure I could

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.609 
goes right in you know I'm sure I could
explain<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.560> I'm<00:01:19.560> sure

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
explain how to put that in but I'm sure

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.570 
explain how to put that in but I'm sure
that<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:21.560> know<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.830> find<00:01:23.040> something

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that you know you can find something

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
that you know you can find something
that<00:01:23.729> tells<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> did<00:01:25.290> change

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that tells you about it but I did change

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580 
that tells you about it but I did change
the<00:01:25.860> gear<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.400> remember<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the gear I remember it's good that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.819 
the gear I remember it's good that
someone<00:01:28.860> brought<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.350> there's<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
someone brought that up so there's to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.580 
someone brought that up so there's to
change<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> roller<00:01:33.960> cam<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
change it over with the roller cam you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.120 
change it over with the roller cam you
have<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> change<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> gear<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> made

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
have to change it to a the gear is made

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
have to change it to a the gear is made
of<00:01:38.340> something<00:01:38.729> different<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
of something different I'm not really I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770 
of something different I'm not really I
can't<00:01:40.290> remember<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.360> important

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
can't remember but it's very important

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.899 
can't remember but it's very important
that<00:01:42.810> switches<00:01:43.320> over<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> had<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.520> sitting

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that switches over so I had one sitting

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.200 
that switches over so I had one sitting
around<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> old<00:01:47.430> distributor<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
around off of the old distributor that I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
around off of the old distributor that I
pulled<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.380> switched

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pulled out of here so I just switched

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.399 
pulled out of here so I just switched
them<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> ticks<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.840> takes<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.290> bit

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
them so it ticks it takes a little bit

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
them so it ticks it takes a little bit
of<00:01:52.500> doing<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.430> possible<00:01:55.640> as<00:01:56.640> far<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of doing but it's possible as far as the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
of doing but it's possible as far as the
timing<00:01:57.570> cover<00:01:57.930> goes<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.740> most<00:01:59.250> people

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
timing cover goes you know most people

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520 
timing cover goes you know most people
wouldn't<00:02:00.210> even<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.140> looked<00:02:01.380> at

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
wouldn't even know when they looked at

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
wouldn't even know when they looked at
it<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:03.000> front<00:02:03.329> might<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.049> front<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it you know the front might the front of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
it you know the front might the front of
my<00:02:04.409> engine<00:02:04.860> looks<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.310> old-school<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.180> know

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
my engine looks very old-school you know

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
my engine looks very old-school you know
there's<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> hoses<00:02:07.320> running<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.860> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
there's a lot of hoses running you just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
there's a lot of hoses running you just
can't<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:09.450> down<00:02:09.660> there<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
can't really get down there and see it a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.720 
can't really get down there and see it a
purist<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.879> but

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
purist would see it but

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.610 
purist would see it but
like<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.720> see<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.239> it's<00:02:17.170> not<00:02:17.379> that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
like I see it but you know it's not that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
like I see it but you know it's not that
big<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.010> deal<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.519> less<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
big of a deal and it's less of a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.540 
big of a deal and it's less of a
headache

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
headache

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.440 
headache
hot<00:02:21.550> bottle<00:02:21.940> here<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:24.940> kind<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.209> see

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
hot bottle here you can kind of see

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.270 
hot bottle here you can kind of see
where<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:25.720> goes<00:02:25.959> down<00:02:26.230> into<00:02:26.530> that's<00:02:27.099> my

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
where that goes down into that's my

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.240 
where that goes down into that's my
dipstick<00:02:27.790> right<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.349> there's<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.470> spot<00:02:29.950> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
dipstick right there there's a spot that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.360 
dipstick right there there's a spot that
is<00:02:31.260> sitting<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.190> pull

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
is sitting there for it that if you pull

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.800 
is sitting there for it that if you pull
the<00:02:33.489> timing<00:02:33.849> cover<00:02:33.970> off<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.450> drill<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the timing cover off you can drill it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.570 
the timing cover off you can drill it
out<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:37.890> fabbed<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.400> little

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
out and I just fabbed up a little

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.199 
out and I just fabbed up a little
bracket<00:02:40.450> there<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.980> hold<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.910> end<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
bracket there to hold the end of the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.759 
bracket there to hold the end of the
dipstick<00:02:43.540> on<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:45.989> attached<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.230> there<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
dipstick on and attached it there and

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.440 
dipstick on and attached it there and
that<00:02:48.130> works<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.430> good<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.000> know<00:02:49.120> pretty

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that works pretty good you know pretty

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.080 
that works pretty good you know pretty
good<00:02:49.660> placement<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.549> definitely<00:02:51.970> have

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
good placement but you definitely have

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.030 
good placement but you definitely have
to<00:02:52.120> plug<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.630> hole<00:02:52.690> over<00:02:53.260> there<00:02:53.709> with

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
to plug that hole over there with

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.789 
to plug that hole over there with
something<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.519> suggest<00:02:54.970> using<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.560> some

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
something I suggest using you know some

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.370 
something I suggest using you know some
type<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.010> metal<00:02:57.549> screw<00:02:58.420> or<00:02:58.599> bolt<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.200> lot<00:02:59.349> of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
type of metal screw or bolt and a lot of

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.199 
type of metal screw or bolt and a lot of
gasket<00:02:59.950> sealer<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.579> remember<00:03:00.880> right<00:03:01.000> that's

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
gasket sealer if I remember right that's

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.530 
gasket sealer if I remember right that's
what<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> did<00:03:04.590> I've<00:03:05.590> never<00:03:05.829> buy<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.299> fuel<00:03:07.299> pump

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
what I did I've never buy that fuel pump

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.339 
what I did I've never buy that fuel pump
it's<00:03:07.870> pretty<00:03:08.110> bad<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.930> were<00:03:11.170> doing

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
it's pretty bad but if you were doing

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's pretty bad but if you were doing
you<00:03:14.349> know<00:03:14.380> running<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:15.040> type<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.310> timing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
you know running this type of timing

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
you know running this type of timing
cover<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.660> course<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.260> know<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.440> have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
cover then of course you know you have

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.080 
cover then of course you know you have
to<00:03:17.859> run<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> electric<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.819> you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:19.030> you

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
to run the electric and you know you

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.960 
to run the electric and you know you
could<00:03:19.299> hide<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.920> somewhere<00:03:20.920> else<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.819> know<00:03:21.850> I

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
could hide it somewhere else you know I

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.370 
could hide it somewhere else you know I
thought<00:03:22.299> about<00:03:22.359> actually<00:03:22.959> putting<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.260> in

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
thought about actually putting it in

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.680 
thought about actually putting it in
there<00:03:23.819> but<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:27.160> does<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:28.060> know<00:03:28.180> does<00:03:28.480> just

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
there but it does a you know does just

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.620 
there but it does a you know does just
as<00:03:28.810> good<00:03:28.959> as<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.230> mechanical<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.630> doesn't

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
as good as a mechanical and it doesn't

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.569 
as good as a mechanical and it doesn't
wear<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.290> know<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:32.470> know<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.950> definitely

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
wear you know you know it definitely

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.120 
wear you know you know it definitely
lasts<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.269> lot<00:03:34.450> longer

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
lasts a lot longer

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.550 
lasts a lot longer
as<00:03:36.130> far<00:03:36.430> as<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.730> pulleys<00:03:37.150> girl<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:38.170> know<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
as far as the pulleys girl you know and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.319 
as far as the pulleys girl you know and
the<00:03:38.680> balancer<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.340> use<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.000> exact<00:03:40.299> same

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
the balancer I use the exact same

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.069 
the balancer I use the exact same
balancer<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.519> since<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.269> t5<00:03:43.810> in

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
balancer and I have since I have a t5 in

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.949 
balancer and I have since I have a t5 in
here<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.859> 80s<00:03:45.250> flywheel<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.930> I

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
here I have the 80s flywheel so so I

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.020 
here I have the 80s flywheel so so I
kept<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.859> same<00:03:51.069> flywheel<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.670> would<00:03:51.940> have

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
kept the same flywheel that would have

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
kept the same flywheel that would have
been<00:03:52.150> era-correct<00:03:52.480> with<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.139> engine<00:03:53.530> you

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
been era-correct with the engine you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.319 
been era-correct with the engine you
know<00:03:53.769> with<00:03:54.090> with<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.150> different<00:03:55.540> bell<00:03:55.780> housing

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
know with with a different bell housing

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.379 
know with with a different bell housing
I'm<00:03:58.329> not<00:03:58.510> sure<00:03:58.720> how<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.079> would<00:03:59.230> work<00:03:59.260> out

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
I'm not sure how that would work out

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.780 
I'm not sure how that would work out
because<00:04:01.389> you<00:04:01.599> need<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> old<00:04:03.459> school

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
because you need a with a old school

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.580 
because you need a with a old school
bell<00:04:04.000> housing<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.599> believe<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.319> would<00:04:05.410> need<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
bell housing I believe you would need a

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.000 
bell housing I believe you would need a
bigger<00:04:05.859> flywheel<00:04:07.980> bigger<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.160> diameter<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.359> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
bigger flywheel bigger in diameter so I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.229 
bigger flywheel bigger in diameter so I
would<00:04:12.010> think<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.489> would<00:04:12.639> change<00:04:12.970> what

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
would think that that would change what

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.479 
would think that that would change what
balancer<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:14.019> would<00:04:14.169> need<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.769> would<00:04:15.310> think

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
balancer you would need I would think

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.800 
balancer you would need I would think
they<00:04:15.579> would<00:04:15.730> kind<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:15.970> work<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.329> tandem<00:04:16.750> with

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
they would kind of work in tandem with

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.469 
they would kind of work in tandem with
each<00:04:16.959> other<00:04:17.289> but<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.530> could<00:04:17.739> be<00:04:17.859> wrong<00:04:17.889> there

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
each other but I could be wrong there

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.580 
each other but I could be wrong there
you<00:04:19.479> know<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.599> don't<00:04:19.930> know<00:04:20.049> as<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.320> never<00:04:20.500> I

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
you know I don't know as I never I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.980 
you know I don't know as I never I
didn't<00:04:20.890> try<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.159> do<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.630> um

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
didn't try and do that um

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.950 
didn't try and do that um
I<00:04:24.080> don't<00:04:24.710> know<00:04:24.770> if<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:24.979> can<00:04:25.039> see<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.550> there<00:04:25.960> but

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
I don't know if you can see in there but

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.999 
I don't know if you can see in there but
it<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.139> four<00:04:27.530> bolt

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
it is a four bolt

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.770 
it is a four bolt
someone<00:04:28.280> mentioned<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.419> just<00:04:29.630> had<00:04:29.750> a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
someone mentioned that and I just had a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.040 
someone mentioned that and I just had a
pulley<00:04:30.050> laying<00:04:30.349> around<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.740> drilled<00:04:31.009> it<00:04:31.130> out

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
pulley laying around it drilled it out

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.420 
pulley laying around it drilled it out
bro<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.259> just<00:04:33.919> transferred<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:36.430> transfer

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
bro I just transferred the transfer

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.120 
bro I just transferred the transfer
punched<00:04:37.789> it<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.349> drilled<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.500> holes<00:04:39.710> for<00:04:40.039> it

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
punched it and drilled the holes for it

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.740 
punched it and drilled the holes for it
and<00:04:40.220> I've<00:04:40.280> never<00:04:40.310> had<00:04:40.639> a<00:04:40.669> problem<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.479> know<00:04:41.599> it

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
and I've never had a problem you know it

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.939 
and I've never had a problem you know it
was<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:41.960> an<00:04:42.080> old<00:04:42.169> pulley<00:04:42.440> sitting<00:04:42.830> around

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
was just an old pulley sitting around

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.559 
was just an old pulley sitting around
this<00:04:43.099> engines<00:04:43.490> free<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> didn't<00:04:44.479> do

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
this engines free so I didn't do

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.950 
this engines free so I didn't do
anything<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:46.610> know<00:04:46.729> necessarily<00:04:47.509> looks

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
anything that you know necessarily looks

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.850 
anything that you know necessarily looks
really<00:04:48.380> really<00:04:48.650> nice<00:04:49.599> but<00:04:50.599> another<00:04:51.319> thing<00:04:51.650> if

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
really really nice but another thing if

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
really really nice but another thing if
you<00:04:51.979> you<00:04:52.430> know<00:04:52.550> if<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.849> do<00:04:52.970> run<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.330> new<00:04:53.599> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
you you know if you do run the new the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.110 
you you know if you do run the new the
newer<00:04:54.830> timing<00:04:55.729> cover

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
newer timing cover

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.350 
newer timing cover
I<00:04:56.270> made<00:04:56.569> these<00:04:56.750> brackets<00:04:57.729> for<00:04:58.729> my<00:04:58.819> alternator

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
I made these brackets for my alternator

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.649 
I made these brackets for my alternator
and<00:04:59.720> you<00:05:00.530> might<00:05:00.740> not<00:05:00.919> be<00:05:01.069> able<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> do<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.819> so

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
and you might not be able to do that so

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.469 
and you might not be able to do that so
you<00:05:02.990> know<00:05:03.979> that<00:05:04.190> was<00:05:04.310> kind<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.759> that<00:05:05.210> took

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
you know that was kind of a that took

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.450 
you know that was kind of a that took
some<00:05:05.720> that<00:05:06.080> took<00:05:06.259> some<00:05:06.409> time<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:07.159> get<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
some that took some time to get that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.330 
some that took some time to get that
together<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:08.440> those<00:05:09.440> are<00:05:09.620> some<00:05:09.889> things<00:05:09.949> you

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
together so those are some things you

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.820 
together so those are some things you
might<00:05:10.520> encounter<00:05:13.090> hmm<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:15.440> know<00:05:15.530> old<00:05:15.740> school

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
might encounter hmm you know old school

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.620 
might encounter hmm you know old school
headers<00:05:16.400> bolt<00:05:16.729> right<00:05:16.909> up<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.360> everything

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
headers bolt right up and everything

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.029 
headers bolt right up and everything
there's<00:05:17.840> there's<00:05:18.199> nothing<00:05:18.560> wrong<00:05:18.710> with<00:05:18.919> the

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
there's there's nothing wrong with the

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.800 
there's there's nothing wrong with the
heads<00:05:19.810> if<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:21.020> wanted<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:22.340> could<00:05:22.810> switch

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
heads if you wanted to you could switch

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.830 
heads if you wanted to you could switch
them<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.259> old-school<00:05:25.250> style<00:05:25.880> heads<00:05:26.180> but<00:05:26.599> I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
them to old-school style heads but I

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.659 
them to old-school style heads but I
mean<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.110> 80s<00:05:27.530> system<00:05:27.949> works<00:05:28.159> pretty<00:05:28.400> good

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
mean the 80s system works pretty good

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.749 
mean the 80s system works pretty good
it's<00:05:28.940> they<00:05:29.780> don't<00:05:29.960> sound<00:05:30.259> very<00:05:30.710> good<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:31.639> know

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
it's they don't sound very good you know

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.870 
it's they don't sound very good you know
I<00:05:31.789> have<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.240> one<00:05:32.419> straight<00:05:32.719> piped<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.880> it's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
I have this one straight piped and it's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.740 
I have this one straight piped and it's
not<00:05:35.120> very<00:05:35.360> loud<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.389> you<00:05:38.630> know

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
not very loud but it's just you know

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.379 
not very loud but it's just you know
there's<00:05:38.960> nothing<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.349> can<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.620> they<00:05:39.800> have<00:05:39.979> no

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
there's nothing you can do they have no

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.120 
there's nothing you can do they have no
new<00:05:41.389> duration<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:42.169> no<00:05:42.320> lift<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:43.009> no

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
new duration and no lift and no

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.490 
new duration and no lift and no
compression<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.150> mean<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.570> wasn't<00:05:44.870> expecting

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
compression so I mean I wasn't expecting

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.570 
compression so I mean I wasn't expecting
much<00:05:45.710> but<00:05:46.070> uh<00:05:46.099> I<00:05:47.500> got<00:05:48.500> four<00:05:48.800> eleven<00:05:49.159> gears<00:05:49.400> in

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
much but uh I got four eleven gears in

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.060 
much but uh I got four eleven gears in
this<00:05:49.699> truck<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.180> it's<00:05:50.300> made<00:05:50.509> this<00:05:50.949> you<00:05:51.949> know

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
this truck and it's made this you know

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.430 
this truck and it's made this you know
pretty<00:05:52.340> snappy<00:05:52.669> so<00:05:53.419> I<00:05:53.449> mean<00:05:53.690> they<00:05:53.840> are<00:05:53.990> they

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
pretty snappy so I mean they are they

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.490 
pretty snappy so I mean they are they
are<00:05:54.560> a<00:05:54.590> good<00:05:54.830> engine<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.250> use<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.870> know<00:05:56.990> and

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
are a good engine to use you know and

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.279 
are a good engine to use you know and
again<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.889> manifold<00:05:58.460> that's<00:05:58.909> dead<00:05:59.449> simple<00:06:00.050> I

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
again the manifold that's dead simple I

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.339 
again the manifold that's dead simple I
just<00:06:01.130> ran<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.580> same<00:06:02.000> old<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:02.539> could<00:06:02.840> change

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
just ran the same old you could change

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.649 
just ran the same old you could change
get<00:06:03.949> better<00:06:04.400> valve<00:06:04.669> covers<00:06:05.120> for<00:06:05.389> it<00:06:05.479> but<00:06:05.599> I

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
get better valve covers for it but I

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.189 
get better valve covers for it but I
just<00:06:05.840> ran<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.199> same<00:06:06.409> old<00:06:06.650> ones<00:06:07.780> you<00:06:08.780> know<00:06:08.900> and

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
just ran the same old ones you know and

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.350 
just ran the same old ones you know and
the<00:06:09.289> same<00:06:09.530> timing<00:06:10.430> cover<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.849> water<00:06:11.030> pump

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
the same timing cover and water pump

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.589 
the same timing cover and water pump
because<00:06:11.690> honestly<00:06:12.580> this<00:06:13.580> water<00:06:13.880> pump<00:06:14.120> system

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
because honestly this water pump system

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.180 
because honestly this water pump system
cools<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.469> lot<00:06:15.800> better<00:06:16.039> than<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:18.050> 65<00:06:18.800> or

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
cools a lot better than the the 65 or

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.770 
cools a lot better than the the 65 or
whatever<00:06:19.400> reason<00:06:19.909> you<00:06:20.030> know<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.449> could<00:06:20.750> be

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
whatever reason you know it could be

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.469 
whatever reason you know it could be
just<00:06:20.900> coincidence<00:06:21.590> but<00:06:22.120> over<00:06:23.120> in<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.270> garage

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
just coincidence but over in the garage

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.339 
just coincidence but over in the garage
there<00:06:23.810> I<00:06:23.840> got<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> galaxy<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.930> this<00:06:26.930> engine

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
there I got a galaxy and this engine

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.740 
there I got a galaxy and this engine
cools<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.860> heck<00:06:28.039> of<00:06:28.069> a<00:06:28.219> lot<00:06:28.370> better<00:06:28.449> with<00:06:29.449> a<00:06:29.479> heck

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
cools a heck of a lot better with a heck

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.140 
cools a heck of a lot better with a heck
of<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:29.930> lot<00:06:30.110> less<00:06:30.319> fans<00:06:30.740> and<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.639> same<00:06:31.849> sized

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
of a lot less fans and the same sized

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.450 
of a lot less fans and the same sized
radiator<00:06:32.659> so<00:06:33.020> you<00:06:33.949> know<00:06:34.070> it's<00:06:34.250> kind<00:06:34.430> of

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
radiator so you know it's kind of

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.980 
radiator so you know it's kind of
interesting

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
interesting

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.610 
interesting
but<00:06:36.550> as<00:06:37.550> far<00:06:37.790> as<00:06:37.820> that<00:06:38.150> goes<00:06:38.900> mechanical

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
but as far as that goes mechanical

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.850 
but as far as that goes mechanical
distributor<00:06:40.190> you<00:06:40.220> know<00:06:40.580> is<00:06:41.530> once<00:06:42.530> you<00:06:42.650> change

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
distributor you know is once you change

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.260 
distributor you know is once you change
the<00:06:42.980> gear<00:06:43.190> you<00:06:43.310> strap<00:06:43.610> it<00:06:43.640> right<00:06:43.880> in<00:06:44.060> that's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
the gear you strap it right in that's

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.010 
the gear you strap it right in that's
fine<00:06:44.600> and<00:06:45.580> I<00:06:46.580> guess<00:06:47.120> the<00:06:47.270> last<00:06:47.300> thing<00:06:47.720> is<00:06:47.840> that

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
fine and I guess the last thing is that

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.460 
fine and I guess the last thing is that
hose<00:06:48.350> and<00:06:48.740> I<00:06:48.860> had<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.310> do<00:06:49.460> because<00:06:49.700> Inlet<00:06:50.510> is<00:06:51.260> on

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
hose and I had to do because Inlet is on

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.680 
hose and I had to do because Inlet is on
the<00:06:51.620> opposite<00:06:52.070> side<00:06:52.340> there's<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:52.970> got<00:06:53.300> a<00:06:53.330> flex

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
the opposite side there's I got a flex

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.190 
the opposite side there's I got a flex
hose<00:06:53.960> so<00:06:54.140> it<00:06:54.200> goes<00:06:54.410> down<00:06:54.650> around<00:06:55.870> now<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:56.990> looks

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
hose so it goes down around now it looks

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.290 
hose so it goes down around now it looks
longer<00:06:57.620> than<00:06:57.800> it<00:06:57.920> is<00:06:58.100> it's<00:06:58.490> not<00:06:58.700> as<00:06:58.850> bad<00:06:59.000> as<00:06:59.060> it

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
longer than it is it's not as bad as it

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.650 
longer than it is it's not as bad as it
looks<00:06:59.860> so<00:07:02.470> then<00:07:03.470> someone<00:07:03.800> had<00:07:04.070> mentioned<00:07:04.660> it

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
looks so then someone had mentioned it

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.980 
looks so then someone had mentioned it
under<00:07:05.930> here<00:07:06.200> someone<00:07:06.980> had<00:07:07.130> mentioned<00:07:07.310> the

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990

little pan well this was off my 65

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.170 
little pan well this was off my 65
before<00:07:11.720> I<00:07:11.750> had<00:07:11.900> built<00:07:13.420> a<00:07:14.420> high<00:07:14.810> volume<00:07:15.050> pan

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.620 
time to paint it like I said free engine

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.310 
time to paint it like I said free engine
there's<00:07:57.620> how<00:07:57.920> better<00:07:58.310> look<00:07:59.320> transferred

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320 
there's how better look transferred
