times I've tried every solvent there is
and<00:00:48.629> nothing<00:00:49.620> works<00:00:50.629> I've<00:00:51.629> set<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> camera<00:00:52.469> up

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
going to talk about the three kinds of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.529 
going to talk about the three kinds of
nuts<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.180> experts<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:04.020> told<00:01:04.350> me<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.300> hull

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
nuts the experts have told me to to hull

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.160 
nuts the experts have told me to to hull
and<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.070> best<00:01:08.399> kind<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.660> now<00:01:09.930> their

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and the very best kind and now their

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.249 
and the very best kind and now their
opinion<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.740> mind<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.729> again<00:01:12.450> that's

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
opinion in mind is this again that's

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.290 
opinion in mind is this again that's
green<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.009> black<00:01:14.280> spots<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
actually do the howling all you do is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
actually do the howling all you do is
you<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.940> kind<00:01:18.149> of<00:01:18.330> smash<00:01:18.660> with<00:01:18.990> these

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you just kind of smash with these

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.419 
you just kind of smash with these
fingers<00:01:20.420> smash<00:01:21.420> actually<00:01:22.229> swish<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.160> shell

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
fingers smash actually swish the shell

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.120 
fingers smash actually swish the shell
and<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.630> pops<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.560> almost

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and it kind of just pops it's almost

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.889 
and it kind of just pops it's almost
squirts<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.849> nut<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.720> like

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
squirts the nut right out of there like

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.180 
squirts the nut right out of there like
that<00:01:27.959> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.200> pulp<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> HUS

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
that so you take the pulp or the HUS

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.969 
that so you take the pulp or the HUS
Pitroda<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.789> there<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.330> then<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:34.289> nut<00:01:34.709> which

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Pitroda in there and then the nut which

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
Pitroda in there and then the nut which
has<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.819> fiber<00:01:36.119> stuff<00:01:36.599> on<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
has still got some fiber stuff on it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
has still got some fiber stuff on it
from<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.830> from<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:39.420> throw<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.899> into<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
from the from the I throw it into a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
from the from the I throw it into a
bucket<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.220> hot<00:01:41.759> water<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:43.640> alright<00:01:44.640> that's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
bucket of hot water here alright that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.190 
bucket of hot water here alright that's
the<00:01:45.330> ideal<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.410> of<00:01:46.590> nut<00:01:47.149> okay<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.989> next

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the ideal kind of nut okay so the next

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.580 
the ideal kind of nut okay so the next
kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.649> nut<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.929> now<00:01:55.289> there's<00:01:55.500> even

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
kind of nut is this and now there's even

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
kind of nut is this and now there's even
a<00:01:55.830> tiny<00:01:56.099> bit<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.550> mold<00:01:56.819> right<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.239> there<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
a tiny bit of mold right on there and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.809 
a tiny bit of mold right on there and
this<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.319> you'd<00:01:58.470> husk<00:01:58.679> by<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> same<00:01:59.250> process

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
this one you'd husk by the same process

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.059 
this one you'd husk by the same process
but<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.660> gets<00:02:00.869> Messier<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.500> Messier

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
but this gets Messier and Messier

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.160 
but this gets Messier and Messier
because<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.789> you<00:02:02.880> when<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.239> split<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.959> guy

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
because when you when you split this guy

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.620 
because when you when you split this guy
open<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.800> mean<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:06.300> black

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
open I mean it's all this more black

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.270 
open I mean it's all this more black
goop<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.379> there<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.009> makes

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
goop in there and it just it just makes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.430 
goop in there and it just it just makes
a<00:02:11.550> bigger<00:02:11.760> mess<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.140> hurts<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a bigger mess I don't think it hurts the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.990 
a bigger mess I don't think it hurts the
nut<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:13.830> all<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> way<00:02:14.550> people<00:02:14.580> have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
nut at all that's the way people have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.760 
nut at all that's the way people have
been<00:02:15.060> husking<00:02:15.660> them<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.020> many<00:02:16.170> many<00:02:16.410> years

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
been husking them for many many years

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.400 
been husking them for many many years
but<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.610> black<00:02:17.760> husk<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.780> nut<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.140> black

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
but that's a black husk the nut is black

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.930 
but that's a black husk the nut is black
throw<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> water<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.080> husk<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.290> there

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.580 
throw that in the water to husk in there
here's<00:02:23.940> another<00:02:24.270> example<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> nut<00:02:25.380> that's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
here's another example of a nut that's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.320 
here's another example of a nut that's
that's<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:28.070> ripe<00:02:29.070> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.490> will<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.940> mean

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that's really ripe if you will I mean

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.020 
that's really ripe if you will I mean
it's<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.520> basketball<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:32.700> somebody

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's just like a basketball if somebody

let all the air out of their flat spots
on<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.760> hardly<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> touch

could just barely get you know I can
poke<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.079> there<00:04:11.230> with<00:04:11.320> my<00:04:11.470> finger<00:04:11.829> like<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
poke in there with my finger like the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.000 
poke in there with my finger like the
experts<00:04:12.549> say<00:04:12.760> but<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.840> just<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:14.350> too<00:04:14.560> hard<00:04:14.829> to

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
experts say but it just it's too hard to

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.039 
experts say but it just it's too hard to
do<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.340> splitting<00:04:15.730> business<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
do this splitting business so then I

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.620 
do this splitting business so then I
take<00:04:17.229> a<00:04:17.290> knife<00:04:17.859> like<00:04:18.130> this<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.209> kind

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
take a knife like this and I just kind

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.380 
take a knife like this and I just kind
of<00:04:19.690> carve<00:04:20.160> push<00:04:21.160> in<00:04:21.370> all<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.820> way<00:04:21.970> around<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
of carve push in all the way around the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.520 
of carve push in all the way around the
nut<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.750> encircle<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.470> nut<00:04:25.169> all<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.380> way

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
nut I encircle the nut all the way

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.070 
nut I encircle the nut all the way
around<00:04:26.830> down<00:04:27.250> from<00:04:27.820> through<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.390> outside<00:04:28.930> of

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
around down from through the outside of

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.840 
around down from through the outside of
the<00:04:29.140> hospital<00:04:29.290> down<00:04:29.919> where<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.220> can<00:04:30.430> feel<00:04:30.669> that

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
the hospital down where I can feel that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.570 
the hospital down where I can feel that
I'm<00:04:30.970> touching<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.479> nut<00:04:32.229> and<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:33.070> sometimes

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
I'm touching the nut and then sometimes

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.520 
I'm touching the nut and then sometimes
I'll<00:04:33.760> just<00:04:33.940> give<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.330> little<00:04:34.540> twist<00:04:35.200> like

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
I'll just give it a little twist like

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.640 
I'll just give it a little twist like
this<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.220> then<00:04:37.090> grasp<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.930> with<00:04:38.110> both<00:04:38.350> hands

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
this and then grasp it with both hands

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.360 
this and then grasp it with both hands
like<00:04:38.800> this

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
like this

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.300 
like this
and<00:04:39.460> twist<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.570> almost<00:04:41.380> always<00:04:41.650> one<00:04:42.039> half

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
and twist and almost always one half

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.640 
and twist and almost always one half
will<00:04:42.550> come<00:04:42.580> right<00:04:42.970> off<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.330> then<00:04:43.450> you're<00:04:44.410> left

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
will come right off and then you're left

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.409 
will come right off and then you're left
with<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:45.039> same<00:04:45.340> peel<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.880> orange<00:04:46.150> thing

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
with this same peel the orange thing

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.930 
with this same peel the orange thing
because<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.900> get<00:04:47.050> right<00:04:47.260> in<00:04:47.320> there<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
because you can get right in there and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.990 
because you can get right in there and
probably<00:04:48.940> 90%<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.080> nuts<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.590> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
probably 90% of the nuts that I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.760 
probably 90% of the nuts that I
harvested<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.180> could<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.900> could<00:04:53.169> do<00:04:53.380> without

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
harvested I could I could do without

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.470 
harvested I could I could do without
using<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.250> process<00:04:54.729> maybe<00:04:55.690> 95%

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
using that process maybe 95%

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.590 
using that process maybe 95%
so<00:04:57.750> then<00:04:58.020> into<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.890> bucket<00:04:59.250> now<00:04:59.940> once<00:05:00.360> they're

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
so then into the bucket now once they're

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.260 
so then into the bucket now once they're
in<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.900> bucket<00:05:01.400> what<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.790> done

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
in the bucket what I have done

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.050 
in the bucket what I have done
I'll<00:05:03.450> get<00:05:03.750> maybe<00:05:03.960> 175<00:05:04.830> nuts<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.550> bucket<00:05:05.940> and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
I'll get maybe 175 nuts in a bucket and

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.420 
I'll get maybe 175 nuts in a bucket and
I<00:05:06.480> just<00:05:06.720> take<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> big<00:05:07.230> rod<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:08.070> stir<00:05:08.370> and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
I just take a big rod and I stir and

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.730 
I just take a big rod and I stir and
stir<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.000> stir<00:05:09.270> agitate<00:05:09.960> they<00:05:10.170> call<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.590> and

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
stir and stir agitate they call it and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.800 
stir and stir agitate they call it and
agitate<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.790> agitate<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.420> that<00:05:12.870> takes<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
agitate and agitate and that takes the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.770 
agitate and agitate and that takes the
more<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.990> fiber<00:05:16.320> off<00:05:16.650> with<00:05:16.860> enough<00:05:17.540> so<00:05:18.540> I

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
more of that fiber off with enough so I

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.350 
more of that fiber off with enough so I
hope<00:05:19.080> that's<00:05:19.290> basics<00:05:19.980> again<00:05:20.160> husking<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.180> nut

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
hope that's basics again husking the nut

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.780 
hope that's basics again husking the nut
the<00:05:21.810> normal<00:05:22.260> process<00:05:22.770> for<00:05:23.010> nut<00:05:23.190> husking<00:05:23.670> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
the normal process for nut husking the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.570 
the normal process for nut husking the
nut<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:24.120> just<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.710> squeeze<00:05:26.040> with<00:05:26.340> both

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
nut is just just to squeeze with both

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.840 
nut is just just to squeeze with both
hands<00:05:27.000> until<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.570> can<00:05:27.840> tear<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.220> husk

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
hands until you can tear the the husk

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.780 
hands until you can tear the the husk
fabric<00:05:30.390> away<00:05:30.660> in<00:05:31.560> any<00:05:31.890> part<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.310> nut<00:05:32.550> and

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
fabric away in any part of the nut and

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.060 
fabric away in any part of the nut and
then<00:05:32.970> it's<00:05:33.150> again<00:05:33.420> just<00:05:34.110> like<00:05:34.290> peeling<00:05:34.800> an

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
then it's again just like peeling an

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.730 
then it's again just like peeling an
orange<00:05:37.100> hostel's<00:05:38.100> go<00:05:38.250> in<00:05:38.430> there<00:05:39.350> nuts<00:05:40.350> go<00:05:40.620> in

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
orange hostel's go in there nuts go in

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.570 
orange hostel's go in there nuts go in
there<00:05:40.950> thank<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:41.970> for<00:05:42.180> watching
