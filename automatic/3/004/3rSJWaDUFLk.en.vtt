00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 good 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.630
 not to make the following decoration what 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 What we need are four varnishes 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.700
 as a base I will apply this brand 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.610
 knabe this varnish comes out very good is the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.810
 colour 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.619
 but the typical 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.500
 good applied a base and then applied 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.500
 this one of the gold brand in gray color 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.730
 and I do the following 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.859
 let it dry 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 since it is dry we apply a second 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.250
 cap 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.440
 and we let it dry to apply the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.150
 cracked varnish we apply the varnish 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.900
 here that the side I'm going to apply this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 purple 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.250
 and I will explain it diagonally 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.570
 and let it dry 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 As you can see, the varnish is already being prepared 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 when it is drying 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.760
 and finally we apply the brightness myself 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.750
 I use this one of the warning mark that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.750
 it comes out very good 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.680
 or you can use the other gel that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.680
 is the organic brand 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.970
 and that's it, our set of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 nails good girls this has been all 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.120
 I hope you liked it and I see them in 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120
