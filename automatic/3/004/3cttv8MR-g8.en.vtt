00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
trying to just get into the moment of

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.260 
trying to just get into the moment of
just<00:01:44.380> appreciating<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.609> I<00:01:45.670> was<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:46.060> drawing

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
just appreciating as I was just drawing

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.749 
just appreciating as I was just drawing
each<00:01:46.450> letter<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.039> nice<00:01:48.219> place<00:01:48.700> to

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
each letter so it's it's a nice place to

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.789 
each letter so it's it's a nice place to
go<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:50.049> copy<00:01:50.319> is<00:01:50.469> quite<00:01:50.619> good<00:01:50.770> for

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
go to but copy is quite good for

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.499 
go to but copy is quite good for
focusing<00:01:51.340> people<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.759> think<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.209> think<00:01:52.390> it

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
focusing people I think I think it

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.169 
focusing people I think I think it
really<00:01:52.659> kind<00:01:52.929> of<00:01:53.079> keeps<00:01:53.619> them<00:01:53.740> sharp<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.490> I

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
really kind of keeps them sharp and I

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.600 
really kind of keeps them sharp and I
think<00:01:55.689> hopefully<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.409> will<00:01:56.619> create<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.429> really

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
think hopefully it will create a really

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.520 
think hopefully it will create a really
great<00:01:57.729> atmosphere<00:01:57.969> of<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:58.750> kind<00:01:58.929> of<00:01:59.049> talking
