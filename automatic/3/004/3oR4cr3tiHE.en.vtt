00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.260
 Talk to people and smart health, my name. 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.090
 It's Christian grandson and today I'm going to answer 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.160
 some basic bodybuilding questions 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.020
 for you and talk about the importance 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.100
 of the rn and in the bodybuilding 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.810
 we must first know the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.140
 four methods most commonly used in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.140
 bodybuilding 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 the first thing you should know 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.070
 following each method it has a name of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 a physical capacity or you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 trains in search of a physical condition 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 of better physical capacity 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 only that you should never forget that each 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 method has a relationship with the other or 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.989
 whether we train and atrophy 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.370
 thinking that it will not gain strength 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.129
 muscle that will not gain power 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 will win so there is no way to isolate a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.850
 method only once when training 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.850
 one has all at once 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.809
 now you are seeing some training with the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 muscle definition name 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.910
 exactly this training does not exist what 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.010
 It so happens that everyone thinks that training 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 four series of 8 is to increase the mass 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 muscle and trains four sets of 15 to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 muscle definition 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 in fact it does not exist it has nothing 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.110
 to do with the series of eight 415 is a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 method of training that can be 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 times with the same goal but some 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 totally different things 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.549
 that is, from today, it will speak more 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 four of eight to increase the mass 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.470
 muscle and four of 15 to dry 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.270
 muscle definition is the ultimate goal of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 training and not a method that should be 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.299
 trained as I have already said and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.520
 muscle definition is an ultimate goal 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.439
 training and not a method which should 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.990
 be trained and as was said in the video 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.740
 Anterior Lose Fat is Definition 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.240
 muscular 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 I have explained fully how it should 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 make it happen in my 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.380
 most important opinion on bodybuilding 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 is the maximum repetition rm so that it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.579
 stay faithful to the exercise it is necessary that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.590
 adapt the weight to the number of repetitions 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.180
 and if not, do not put the number 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.920
 of repetitions to arrive a load 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.320
 If a load is placed, reach number 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.729
 repetitions and this in my opinion is the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 most important in bodybuilding 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.950
 when running a series of 10 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.750
 maximum repetitions 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.980
 the idea is that you can not 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.110
 11a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.549
 or is going to have a concentric fault 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.310
 will not be able to finish executing the 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:29.680
 exercise and hence comes the name 10 repetitions 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 knows the difference between the two 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.069
 here is an example of multiple series 4 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.110
 series of 10 maximum repetitions is 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.340
 considered the multiple series because you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.200
 can not increase the overhead 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.299
 during the four grades 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.760
 if you can increase the overload 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.129
 during the series have two reasons the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.120
 first or you got stronger and got 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.859
 really increase 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.170
 only the next time you do it 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.209
 going out again will always be this increase 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.640
 ie it can not decrease further 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.690
 or the second reason you were not 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.190
 doing in the rm 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.859
 or is doing the wrong way 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:10.269
 and now comes an example from the series 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:12.280
 pyramidal where you perform a training 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.750
 pyramid you increase the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 overload or decrease overload 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.859
 depending on how the series is 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.510
 the point is that often people 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.579
 who trains in the gym they end up 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.049
 doing pyramidal training instead of doing 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.630
 a multiple-series workout or 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.609
 It turns out that almost everyone always trains 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.889
 pyramidal because the person there while 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.359
 no matter if she does prefer multiple 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.739
 but it will increase the overhead and 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.690
 even so because I was not 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.730
 training in rm and this is the main 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.730
 problem that I see in bodybuilding today 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.519
 the two styles are totally 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.410
 and should be used throughout the 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.599
 year in bodybuilding or the goal 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.609
 is not to let your body adapt 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.590
 so the two always have to be 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:58.389
 used today, the studies show that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.250
 we can hardly increase the 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.650
 muscle mass in less than a month 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.359
 and remember when I refer here it is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.599
 always people who train way 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.599
 Natural 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.410
 obviously the training given by a 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.209
 physical education teacher 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.769
 But there are two things I'm going to tell 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.269
 for you and I'll help you 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.750
 understand how the training should be 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.750
 mounted 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.800
 first, the goal should be the focus 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.569
 of the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.129
 teacher but often the teacher 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.270
 knows that the student has to go through some 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.009
 previous hours 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.319
 before reaching the goal 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.539
 student's main adaptation for example 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.830
 where it spends some time 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.280
 the student learn to execute the movements 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.500
 the last situation 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.150
 this is undoubtedly what dictates the model of 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.129
 training that will be used 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.960
 this is because in today's studies 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.129
 in knows that to increase for example 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.569
 muscle mass 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.879
 we have to train at least twice 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.620
 in the week the same muscular group 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.690
 the point is that always move two 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.460
 times in the week and if she does not 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.449
 this is where the wisdom and all 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.370
 experience of the education professional 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.370
 physics when setting up your workout 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.919
 Now let's answer some questions. 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.919
 Bodybuilding Basics 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:15.430
 the abdomen he should be trained as 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.949
 any other muscle group of 48 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.379
 to 72 hours apart and if you 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.539
 the hypertrophy goal I have 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.539
 to rest the muscle that is has in 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.029
 intense four series 3 Sergio matters 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.580
 What matters is rm in muscle and 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:35.080
 repeat interval from 48 to 72 hours 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.759
 to rest because this is the time 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.650
 which has been found in several 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.270
 necessary studies so that the muscle 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.199
 regain full recovery after a 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.909
 intense training 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.620
 it is logical that sometimes this time varies 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.330
 from person to person but this was the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.139
 best result found for the 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.139
 most people 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.170
 I do not know if this is a goal you do not 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.520
 need to rest for 48 to 72 hours 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.890
 The point is that you have to take into 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.870
 mind that the serial number can not be 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.270
 the same to which you would train 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.410
 with rest from 48 to 72 hours or 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.410
 the number will be reduced 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.010
 It depends on the intensity of the airmobile but 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.570
 often for those who have the goal of 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.980
 aesthetics do not have to worry about 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.110
 this can only continue to make its 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.450
 heroically and for whom 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.710
 Aesthetic demand is in no hurry to 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.510
 achieve your goals 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.960
 only continue in your games do not have 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.960
 no problem 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.240
