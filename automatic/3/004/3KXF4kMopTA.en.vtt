00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.329
 Enough for me 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.420
 good in this video we are going to see two 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 ways to tip the elephant 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.600
 the first one consists 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 in using the glitch of the mines 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.420
 trap that I have shown you in a video 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.230
 previous 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.420
 we approach the elephant we place the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.860
 good mines with a voucher although in this 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.840
 case I have placed 2 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.310
 let's go to the summary execution time 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.540
 minimum we put it to the top here would be 4 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.540
 and throw mines to sack 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.130
 now you just have to shoot the mines 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 and the explosion is going to turn around in the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 funk 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 there you have is completely overturned 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 all right 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.010
 at sight is the most effective method 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.010
 but let's now see a second method 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.830
 good in this second method what's 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.040
 what to do is to be with another player 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.240
 and that each pilot an elephant 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.080
 then you make them collide frontally 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.520
 between the two vehicles 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.609
 in such a way that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.899
 at some point one will be left 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:59.850
 under the other one like he's going to push 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.860
 and it will end up turning it around 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.720
 it does not always come out 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.720
 I prefer the first method 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.960
 and well there you have it the the elephant 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 of the red flag 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.880
 thanks also to the unevenness of this area 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.660
 it is below the other 's other's 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:27.020
 elephant and ends turning it around 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.020
 pushing it back 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 now here sticks a turn 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.610
 and we have it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.390
 the elephant completely overturned 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.280
 Well, that's all, if you liked it 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.280
