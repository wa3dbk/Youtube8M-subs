00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.970
 the first memories I have of the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.190
 kitchen are with my mother from behind 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 elaborating something while I played in the 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.170
 table where we ate and I do not know why to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.470
 that scene of that image I put the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.450
 sound of the background radio but 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.450
 linked to a gastronomy program 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.170
 when I was a small practitioner all 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.720
 family life ends up around 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.860
 that kitchen in which aromas came out 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.070
 no longer just stews or products but 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 loaded with memory of affection of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.059
 experience 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.000
 my childhood is marked by the aromas 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.570
 and the vapors from the leaves of that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 kitchen and by necessity or interest 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 of my mother because I learned to 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
 detect the small details that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.710
 did or do things 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.590
 simple something exceptional my mother 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.860
 It is always fixated or course 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.690
 has tried that I looked at those 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 small details that make the simple 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.299
 something wonderful 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 When I started I was studying that 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.030
 he began to change my mother's recipes 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.950
 Christian for example you have noticed if 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.399
 we take the records in this way 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.929
 how they change the pre flavor and the texture 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.399
 for example I change them to the meats that 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.289
 usually they with whom they 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.560
 elaborate your ski are in the background in the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.510
 kitchen is the chain of experiences 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.840
 that overlap 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.240
 and this is this book 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.240
 thought with the mouth and formulated with the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 heart and memory - with the best 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.840
 of my tradition with all the experience 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 professional that has accumulated at 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.860
 over the years from that perspective 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.250
 amateur enthusiast of person who 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.070
 he likes to eat 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.050
 in the background my daily kitchen has 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.560
 gone enriching with the experience of 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.920
 other professionals some known and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.610
 many of them have or 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.740
 every day I cook for my family 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.520
 I usually go out in the afternoon I go to 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.780
 home I start to prepare dinner or my 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.270
 woman usually says that I'm going 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.210
 hours by the extractor but the truth is 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.140
 that apart from liking the act of 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.150
 cook I think I'm providing 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 to my family to my son especially that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 it's very small 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.560
 small doses of culture 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.989
 because that's the kitchen is an expression 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.290
 of culture is a tool of 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.860
 health and pleasure is a look towards the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.440
 past and because it is also a look 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.910
 towards the lives of others the recipes of my 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.459
 house more than a simple cookbook 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.489
 It is a compilation of knowledge and 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.580
 know is the demanding look of the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.250
 cutting edge put on the kitchen 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.410
 usual and simple and everyday is the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.860
 way to show you how some dishes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.760
 they can be
