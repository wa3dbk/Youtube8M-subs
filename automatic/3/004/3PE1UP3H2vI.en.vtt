00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.070
 also a non- woven fabric is 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.470
 common it is a little thicker than 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 It was a blazer there that I found beautiful. 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.380
 resembles a blazer cap but I'm a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 small then to play I did with 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.530

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 I matinho put ink fabric of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.030
 so good nuances about dust 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.510
 This is it, you just have to calm down with some 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.360
 wooden beads 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.950
 I loved this one too, very cute 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.170

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.049

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 It was like that and it never came out. 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.570
 Hear, never leave, now I hope. 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.730
 So what about the Oz in the city? 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.959
 especially in winter now the ounce 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.450
 comes with everything 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.310
 this fabric that looks very cool with 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.700

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 Ending is there, right? 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.080

 Look how big it's been, let's go 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 come back here 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.020

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.340
 You can do all this. 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.270

 more or less so the person who goes 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.940
 to start in this I speak people have to have 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.860
 a little patience can not discourage 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.530
 but if I 'm good I'll take more or 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.570
 at least 15 minutes in less than 15 minutes alone 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.690
