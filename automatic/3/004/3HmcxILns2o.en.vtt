showing you guys how to build my very
easy<00:00:04.440> timer<00:00:04.890> now<00:00:05.190> I've<00:00:05.430> been<00:00:05.549> building<00:00:05.819> I've

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
easy timer now I've been building I've

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.820 
easy timer now I've been building I've
been<00:00:06.330> well<00:00:06.569> not<00:00:06.720> building<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.350> I've<00:00:07.560> been

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
been well not building but I've been

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.919 
been well not building but I've been
pretty<00:00:08.490> much<00:00:08.580> using<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.000> stopwatch<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.840> my

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
pretty much using a stopwatch on my

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.169 
pretty much using a stopwatch on my
computer<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.349> about<00:00:10.530> an<00:00:10.620> hour<00:00:10.650> now<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.849> figure

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
computer for about an hour now to figure

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.539 
computer for about an hour now to figure
out<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.599> pretty<00:00:13.139> much<00:00:13.230> exact<00:00:13.740> times<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.460> this

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
out the pretty much exact times for this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.180 
out the pretty much exact times for this
now<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:15.719> 5<00:00:15.960> cobwebs<00:00:16.470> right<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.770> so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
now I got about 5 cobwebs right here so

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.470 
now I got about 5 cobwebs right here so
once<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.490> minecart<00:00:17.880> hits<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.390> it's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
once this minecart hits down here it's

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
once this minecart hits down here it's
gonna<00:00:18.570> hit<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.039> detector<00:00:20.039> rail<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.910> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
gonna hit this detector rail which it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
gonna hit this detector rail which it's
gonna<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> minute<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.350> 5<00:00:22.500> seconds

been<00:00:28.560> doing<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> while<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
been doing this for a while now a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.269 
been doing this for a while now a
stopwatch<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.949> rid<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
stopwatch now if I was to get rid of a

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.720 
stopwatch now if I was to get rid of a
cobweb<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:33.270> cobwebs<00:00:33.870> wait<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:35.040> three

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
cobweb for cobwebs wait one two three

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.420 
cobweb for cobwebs wait one two three
four<00:00:36.090> yes<00:00:36.270> four<00:00:36.510> cobwebs<00:00:37.140> will<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.250> around

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
four yes four cobwebs will take around

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
four yes four cobwebs will take around
55<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.750> 58<00:00:40.260> seconds<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.340> usually<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
55 to 58 seconds I usually like the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
55 to 58 seconds I usually like the
minute-to-minute<00:00:42.750> eight<00:00:43.230> seconds<00:00:43.680> better

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
minute-to-minute eight seconds better

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
minute-to-minute eight seconds better
but<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.180> whatever<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.320> once<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:46.950> just

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
but you know whatever so once it is just

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
but you know whatever so once it is just
uh<00:00:47.340> once<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> detect<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.379> down

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
uh once it is detect around right down

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
uh once it is detect around right down
here<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:49.950> thus<00:00:50.309> activate<00:00:51.000> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
here it's gonna thus activate this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200 
here it's gonna thus activate this
monostable<00:00:51.719> circuit<00:00:52.489> which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
monostable circuit which is going to go

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.319 
monostable circuit which is going to go
all<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.180> activating<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
all the way down here activating this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
all the way down here activating this
piston<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.680> piston<00:00:59.070> goes<00:00:59.219> up

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
piston now when this piston goes up

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
piston now when this piston goes up
which<00:00:59.670> you'll<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.120> soon<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> piston<00:01:00.960> should

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
which you'll see soon the piston should

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
which you'll see soon the piston should
be<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.440> soon<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.430> activate<00:01:02.969> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
be going up soon it will activate this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.310 
be going up soon it will activate this
one<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.480> it'll<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.199> I'll

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
one and then it'll go up and then I'll

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.509 
one and then it'll go up and then I'll
do<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.500> again<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.280> again<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
do it again and go up and do it again so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
do it again and go up and do it again so
we<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.049> saying<00:01:07.229> about

make up the walls game where um you get

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
make up the walls game where um you get

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
maybe 20 minutes to get your resources

maybe 20 minutes to get your resources
together<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.869> stuff<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> then

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
together and all that stuff and then

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
together and all that stuff and then
this<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.189> activate<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> walls<00:01:54.390> will

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this will activate and the walls will

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.170 
this will activate and the walls will
come<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:54.869> beautiful<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.310> could<00:01:56.700> use<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> for

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
come down beautiful you could use it for

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
come down beautiful you could use it for
a<00:01:57.210> Hunger<00:01:57.869> Games<00:01:58.049> map<00:01:58.259> where<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> door<00:01:58.979> opens<00:01:59.310> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
a Hunger Games map where a door opens up

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.410 
a Hunger Games map where a door opens up
at<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> certain<00:01:59.729> time<00:01:59.880> during<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
at a certain time during the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
at a certain time during the
conjugations<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.229> usually<00:02:01.350> most

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
conjugations back because usually most

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
conjugations back because usually most
Hunger<00:02:02.219> Games<00:02:02.369> maps<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.700> usually<00:02:03.000> hopefully

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
Hunger Games maps are usually hopefully

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
Hunger Games maps are usually hopefully
around<00:02:03.570> 10<00:02:03.750> minutes<00:02:03.899> long<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.829> make

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
around 10 minutes long so you can make

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.380 
around 10 minutes long so you can make
it<00:02:05.040> open<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.340> halfway<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> between<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> map

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it open up halfway and between the map

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
it open up halfway and between the map
or<00:02:06.570> something<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.110> good<00:02:07.259> stuff<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
or something with some good stuff in it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
or something with some good stuff in it
now<00:02:08.730> let's<00:02:09.120> just<00:02:09.330> start<00:02:09.480> building<00:02:09.570> this<00:02:09.750> thing

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
now let's just start building this thing

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.270 
now let's just start building this thing
right<00:02:10.020> away<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.290> it's<00:02:10.590> very<00:02:10.830> easy<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.130> build

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
right away it's it's very easy to build

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.100 
right away it's it's very easy to build
and<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:12.390> need<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.750> over<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
and I don't really need to go over it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870 
and I don't really need to go over it
because<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.320> lot<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.860> probably<00:02:13.980> will<00:02:14.550> want

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
because a lot of you probably will want

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.000 
because a lot of you probably will want
to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.120> something<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.680> what<00:02:16.860> we're

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
to do something with it so what we're

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
to do something with it so what we're
going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.340> need<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.850> actually<00:02:18.270> take<00:02:18.630> out

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
going to need to do is actually take out

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.250 
going to need to do is actually take out
our<00:02:19.050> rails<00:02:20.660> come<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.750> give<00:02:21.930> me<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.050> wrap

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
our rails come on give me that wrap

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.890 
our rails come on give me that wrap
there<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:24.240> three<00:02:24.450> blocks<00:02:24.630> right<00:02:24.750> here

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
there so I got three blocks right here

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.120 
there so I got three blocks right here
what<00:02:24.990> you're<00:02:25.080> gonna<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.560> put<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.860> detector

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
what you're gonna do is put a detector

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.320 
what you're gonna do is put a detector
rail<00:02:26.430> right<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> middle<00:02:26.850> three<00:02:27.030> blocks

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
rail right in the middle three blocks

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.360 
rail right in the middle three blocks
then<00:02:27.990> put<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> power<00:02:28.440> rail<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.830> side<00:02:29.010> power<00:02:29.190> on

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
then put a power rail this side power on

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
then put a power rail this side power on
this<00:02:29.490> side<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.570> side<00:02:30.780> you're

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
this side and then on one side you're

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.870 
this side and then on one side you're
gonna<00:02:30.960> go<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> put<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.460> lever

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
gonna go up like that and put a lever

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.710 
gonna go up like that and put a lever
underneath

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
underneath

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.510 
underneath
thus<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.830> activating<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:37.310> power<00:02:38.310> drop

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
thus just activating this one power drop

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.620 
thus just activating this one power drop
couldn't<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.030> word<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.510> say

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
couldn't think of the word for say

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.990 
couldn't think of the word for say
powered<00:02:40.050> rather<00:02:40.610> alright<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.820> we're<00:02:41.940> gonna

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
powered rather alright now we're gonna

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.860 
powered rather alright now we're gonna
go<00:02:42.210> up<00:02:42.240> three<00:02:42.630> blocks<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.200> one<00:02:43.550> two<00:02:44.690> three<00:02:45.690> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
go up three blocks so one two three and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.680 
go up three blocks so one two three and
then<00:02:46.020> we're<00:02:46.110> gonna<00:02:46.200> go<00:02:46.350> over<00:02:46.500> three<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.010> 1<00:02:47.250> 2<00:02:48.030> 3

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
then we're gonna go over three so 1 2 3

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.880 
then we're gonna go over three so 1 2 3
and<00:02:48.960> then<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.260> 1<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:49.590> you're<00:02:49.740> probably

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
and then up 1 now you're probably

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.290 
and then up 1 now you're probably
wondering<00:02:50.040> why<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.490> need<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.850> come<00:02:50.970> out<00:02:51.120> like

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
wondering why I need to come out like

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.360 
wondering why I need to come out like
this<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.900> here<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:53.100> know<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.220> let<00:02:53.340> me

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this right here you know what let me

just look this up real quick so go up
with<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:54.990> power<00:02:55.110> rails<00:02:55.380> then<00:02:55.860> put<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> regular

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
with your power rails then put a regular

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.070 
with your power rails then put a regular
rail<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.730> powered<00:02:56.970> rail<00:02:57.120> right<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:58.020> is

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
rail and powered rail right here this is

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.570 
rail and powered rail right here this is
where<00:02:58.350> your<00:02:58.530> minecart<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.010> gonna<00:02:59.130> start<00:02:59.400> right

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
where your minecart is gonna start right

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.670 
where your minecart is gonna start right
here<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.660> mean<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> lever

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
here so I mean you can just have a lever

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
here so I mean you can just have a lever
right<00:03:01.860> here<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.130> activate<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.690> you're

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
right here to activate it but if you're

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.880 
right here to activate it but if you're
going<00:03:03.990> into<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.320> room<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.800> want

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
going into a room and you want

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.380 
going into a room and you want
everything<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.340> close<00:03:05.610> off<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.120> start

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
everything to close off and then start

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.120 
everything to close off and then start
the<00:03:06.570> timer<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:07.410> you're<00:03:07.560> gonna<00:03:07.710> want<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.100> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the timer then you're gonna want like a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.520 
the timer then you're gonna want like a
T<00:03:08.370> flip-flop<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:09.180> into<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.570> block<00:03:09.960> which

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
T flip-flop going into this block which

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.750 
T flip-flop going into this block which
will<00:03:10.710> activate<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.280> repeater<00:03:11.520> thus

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
will activate the repeater thus

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.880 
will activate the repeater thus
activating<00:03:12.300> everything<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.770> people

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
activating everything this is for people

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.860 
activating everything this is for people
that<00:03:14.040> want<00:03:14.160> something<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:15.030> keep<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.600> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
that want something to keep going and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.500 
that want something to keep going and
then<00:03:16.020> blow<00:03:16.320> up<00:03:16.350> or<00:03:16.680> something<00:03:17.100> or<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:18.360> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510

then blow up or something or just you
don't<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> timer<00:03:19.800> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
don't want it to just be a timer you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.440 
don't want it to just be a timer you
want<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.490> pretty<00:03:21.120> much<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.390> this

cobweb what I like going there and

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.920 
cobweb what I like going there and
that's<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.160> reason<00:04:05.489> why<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.610> don't<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:06.690> all<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
that's the reason why I don't go all the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.930 
that's the reason why I don't go all the
way<00:04:07.020> down<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.410> let's<00:04:07.680> say<00:04:07.830> if<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.070> why<00:04:08.700> would

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
way down like let's say if I why would

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.490 
way down like let's say if I why would
why<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> give<00:04:09.330> one<00:04:09.570> more<00:04:09.750> spacing<00:04:10.200> because<00:04:10.260> if<00:04:10.410> I

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
why I give one more spacing because if I

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.560 
why I give one more spacing because if I
put<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> cobweb<00:04:10.920> here<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.940> some<00:04:12.120> reason<00:04:12.420> when<00:04:12.540> a

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
put a cobweb here for some reason when a

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.840 
put a cobweb here for some reason when a
cobweb<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.500> over<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.070> powered<00:04:14.430> rail<00:04:14.580> it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
cobweb is right over a powered rail it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.229 
cobweb is right over a powered rail it
won't

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
won't

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.880 
won't
pretty<00:04:15.720> much<00:04:15.840> doesn't<00:04:16.020> matter<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.620> will<00:04:16.710> just

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
pretty much doesn't matter it will just

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.560 
pretty much doesn't matter it will just
go<00:04:17.010> straight<00:04:17.310> through<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.549> last<00:04:17.760> cobweb<00:04:18.359> so

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
go straight through this last cobweb so

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.029 
go straight through this last cobweb so
I<00:04:18.600> pretty<00:04:19.109> much<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:19.289> brought<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.770> up<00:04:19.859> one

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
I pretty much just brought it up one

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.200 
I pretty much just brought it up one
more

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
more

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.430 
more

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
now once all that's in that's pretty

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.909 
now once all that's in that's pretty
much<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:23.710> if<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:24.010> put<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.340> lever<00:04:24.550> here<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:26.500> we

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
much it so if I put a lever here now we

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.379 
much it so if I put a lever here now we
got<00:04:27.070> our<00:04:27.190> minute<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.639> five<00:04:27.880> two<00:04:28.060> minute<00:04:28.300> eight

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
got our minute and five two minute eight

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.240 
got our minute and five two minute eight
second<00:04:28.900> timer<00:04:29.050> going<00:04:29.380> now<00:04:29.800> all<00:04:29.919> we<00:04:29.979> have<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.160> do

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
second timer going now all we have to do

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.800 
second timer going now all we have to do
is<00:04:30.340> put<00:04:30.490> our<00:04:30.580> monostable<00:04:31.000> circuit<00:04:31.389> in<00:04:31.479> so<00:04:31.630> come

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
is put our monostable circuit in so come

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.750 
is put our monostable circuit in so come
down<00:04:31.990> here<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.350> where<00:04:32.470> our<00:04:32.710> detector<00:04:33.460> rail<00:04:33.610> is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
down here to where our detector rail is

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.210 
down here to where our detector rail is
come<00:04:33.940> out<00:04:34.060> one<00:04:35.050> actually<00:04:35.560> with<00:04:35.710> us<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.010> why

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
come out one actually with us on why

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.740 
come out one actually with us on why
can't<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.550> come<00:04:36.699> out<00:04:36.820> with<00:04:36.940> one<00:04:37.150> with<00:04:37.300> us

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
can't you come out with one with us

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.469 
can't you come out with one with us
and<00:04:38.050> then<00:04:38.710> come<00:04:38.860> up<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.160> block<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.240> dust

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
and then come up a block so this dust

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.480 
and then come up a block so this dust
will<00:04:40.630> go<00:04:40.720> into<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.139> block<00:04:41.380> putting<00:04:42.070> power<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
will go into this block putting power to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.159 
will go into this block putting power to
it<00:04:42.610> next<00:04:43.060> we're<00:04:43.240> gonna<00:04:43.330> put<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.600> torch<00:04:43.870> on<00:04:44.020> top

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
it next we're gonna put a torch on top

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.500 
it next we're gonna put a torch on top
and<00:04:44.770> then<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.610> Glock<00:04:45.880> on<00:04:46.000> top<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.300> make<00:04:46.479> a

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
and then you Glock on top of that make a

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.760 
and then you Glock on top of that make a
torch<00:04:46.780> sandwiches<00:04:47.199> right<00:04:47.320> now<00:04:47.440> we're<00:04:47.620> going

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
torch sandwiches right now we're going

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.350 
torch sandwiches right now we're going
to<00:04:47.830> make<00:04:47.979> our<00:04:48.100> monostable<00:04:48.520> circuit<00:04:48.940> now<00:04:49.300> you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
to make our monostable circuit now you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.670 
to make our monostable circuit now you
can<00:04:49.510> go<00:04:49.600> left<00:04:49.780> or<00:04:49.990> right<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.320> doesn't<00:04:50.500> really

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
can go left or right it doesn't really

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.920 
can go left or right it doesn't really
matter<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.520> just<00:04:51.699> go<00:04:51.820> over<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.449> then<00:04:52.510> coming

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
matter so just go over and then coming

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.330 
matter so just go over and then coming
out<00:04:53.050> from<00:04:53.229> this<00:04:53.380> block<00:04:53.590> we're<00:04:53.770> going<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.070> put<00:04:54.220> a

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
out from this block we're going to put a

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.330 
out from this block we're going to put a
repeater<00:04:54.729> set<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.419> four<00:04:55.690> tix<00:04:55.930> delay<00:04:56.310> put<00:04:57.310> a

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
repeater set to four tix delay put a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.010 
repeater set to four tix delay put a
block<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:57.669> front<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.210> repeater<00:04:58.570> any

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
block in front of that repeater any

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.230 
block in front of that repeater any
block<00:04:59.260> above<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.830> repeater<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.030> next

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
block above that repeater and the next

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.580 
block above that repeater and the next
we're<00:05:01.330> gonna<00:05:01.389> put<00:05:01.510> dust<00:05:01.870> right<00:05:02.110> above<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
we're gonna put dust right above the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.650 
we're gonna put dust right above the
repeater<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.130> then<00:05:03.610> down<00:05:03.880> on<00:05:04.180> top<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.600> the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
repeater and then down on top of the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.020 
repeater and then down on top of the
block<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:04.990> goes<00:05:05.139> in<00:05:05.260> front<00:05:05.289> repeater<00:05:06.030> so

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
block that goes in front repeater so

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.820 
block that goes in front repeater so
many<00:05:07.180> repeats<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.960> then<00:05:08.169> we're<00:05:08.289> gonna<00:05:08.410> put<00:05:08.650> a

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
many repeats and then we're gonna put a

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.260 
many repeats and then we're gonna put a
torch<00:05:09.190> right<00:05:09.340> here<00:05:09.460> should<00:05:09.760> go<00:05:09.880> off<00:05:10.060> because

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
torch right here should go off because

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.120 
torch right here should go off because
this<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:10.570> gonna<00:05:10.840> be<00:05:11.020> our<00:05:11.050> monostable<00:05:11.680> circuit

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
this is gonna be our monostable circuit

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.860 
this is gonna be our monostable circuit
like<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.310> said<00:05:12.520> next<00:05:13.389> we're<00:05:13.570> gonna<00:05:13.660> come<00:05:13.840> a

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
like I said next we're gonna come a

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.200 
like I said next we're gonna come a
block<00:05:14.199> down<00:05:14.680> from<00:05:14.949> the<00:05:15.070> torch<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.550> then<00:05:16.000> out

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
block down from the torch and then out

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.570 
block down from the torch and then out
three<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:16.720> one<00:05:16.930> two<00:05:17.320> three<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.100> then<00:05:18.460> we're

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
three so one two three and then we're

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.090 
three so one two three and then we're
gonna<00:05:18.669> put<00:05:18.850> dusts<00:05:19.150> all<00:05:19.300> along<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:20.620> then

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
gonna put dusts all along that and then

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.700 
gonna put dusts all along that and then
we're<00:05:21.220> gonna<00:05:21.310> put<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.820> sticky<00:05:22.360> piston<00:05:22.510> here<00:05:22.780> now

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
we're gonna put a sticky piston here now

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.469 
we're gonna put a sticky piston here now
this<00:05:23.860> will<00:05:24.039> be<00:05:24.130> our<00:05:24.280> first<00:05:24.520> minute<00:05:25.120> sticky

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
this will be our first minute sticky

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.879 
this will be our first minute sticky
piston<00:05:25.810> if<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:25.990> only<00:05:26.200> want<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.500> minute<00:05:26.740> there

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
piston if you only want a minute there

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.140 
piston if you only want a minute there
you<00:05:26.919> go<00:05:27.099> you're<00:05:27.310> pretty<00:05:27.460> much<00:05:27.669> that's<00:05:27.849> all<00:05:28.030> you

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
you go you're pretty much that's all you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.400 
you go you're pretty much that's all you
need<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.330> put<00:05:28.479> in<00:05:28.570> but<00:05:28.810> I'm<00:05:28.930> gonna<00:05:29.020> do<00:05:29.200> about

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
need to put in but I'm gonna do about

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.529 
need to put in but I'm gonna do about
five<00:05:29.620> minutes<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.160> when<00:05:30.820> we<00:05:30.940> when<00:05:31.240> we<00:05:31.330> got<00:05:31.450> our

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
five minutes so when we when we got our

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.760 
five minutes so when we when we got our
one<00:05:31.690> sticky<00:05:31.960> piston<00:05:32.200> we're<00:05:32.349> just<00:05:32.470> gonna<00:05:32.560> come

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
one sticky piston we're just gonna come

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.260 
one sticky piston we're just gonna come
out<00:05:32.950> from<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.310> middle<00:05:33.430> part<00:05:33.729> of<00:05:33.910> where<00:05:34.120> this

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
out from the middle part of where this

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.050 
out from the middle part of where this
is<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:35.139> then<00:05:35.889> each<00:05:36.160> repeater<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.669> gonna<00:05:36.910> be

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
is and then each repeater is gonna be

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.930 
is and then each repeater is gonna be
another<00:05:37.300> minute<00:05:37.510> so<00:05:37.900> that's<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.260> minute<00:05:38.940> come

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
another minute so that's a minute come

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.600 
another minute so that's a minute come
out<00:05:40.090> two<00:05:40.389> more<00:05:40.860> put<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:41.889> repeater<00:05:42.130> there<00:05:42.370> that's

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
out two more put a repeater there that's

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.260 
out two more put a repeater there that's
a<00:05:42.760> minute

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
a minute

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.400 
a minute
