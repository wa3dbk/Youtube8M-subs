00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
and and the place fills up with it and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
and and the place fills up with it and
we<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.310> all<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.580> all<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.120> stuff<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.750> we
