00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
kind of harsh to my edges I've learned

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.900 
kind of harsh to my edges I've learned
that<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.650> pulls<00:05:14.949> it<00:05:15.130> out<00:05:15.220> because<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.610> grips

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
that it pulls it out because it grips

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.360 
that it pulls it out because it grips
them<00:05:16.150> too<00:05:16.360> hard<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.440> like<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.650> just<00:05:17.800> put<00:05:18.220> it

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
them too hard so I like to just put it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.730 
them too hard so I like to just put it
on<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.030> scarf<00:05:19.419> so<00:05:19.750> because<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.139> sleep<00:05:20.380> crazy

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
on to the scarf so because I sleep crazy

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.490 
on to the scarf so because I sleep crazy
so<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.310> doesn't<00:05:21.699> rub<00:05:22.570> up<00:05:22.660> against<00:05:22.900> my<00:05:23.050> edges

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
so it doesn't rub up against my edges

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.230 
so it doesn't rub up against my edges
and<00:05:23.680> when<00:05:23.830> it<00:05:23.979> does<00:05:24.160> fall<00:05:24.460> off<00:05:24.669> they<00:05:24.850> can<00:05:25.030> just

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
and when it does fall off they can just

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.390 
and when it does fall off they can just
fall<00:05:25.990> off<00:05:26.169> smoothly<00:05:26.470> without<00:05:26.650> pulling<00:05:27.220> any<00:05:27.310> of
