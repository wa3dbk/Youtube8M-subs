00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.550
 extension 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.880
 Per hundred as I handle all kinds of techniques 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.840
 I can use the technique what else 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.850
 percent 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.540
 what tomas valley is needed

 mexiquense fine hair 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.340
 Well, there are some techniques that advise us for your type of change 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
 by way of example the extensions that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410
 the rubber extensions 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.520

 percent in fine hair 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.400
 percent 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.380
 they can damage a little 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.910
 the hair itself got then 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.159
 the rubber extensions 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.159
 and in another it was advised 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.059
 What kind of extensions do I recommend? Practically all the others 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 Outstanding extensions can go perfectly 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.089
 the keratin extensions also 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.629
 but eye also depends on him 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.010
 of the pensions that you have arrived before 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.590
 previously it closes that is to say of keratin and you have not been given good 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.959
 result 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.159
 then you can stern on trying other assistance techniques and stitching 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.949
 it also works very well 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.889
 percent woke up 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.149
 is to see the amount of hair you have 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.589
 because for example if you have a small amount of this but you can not 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.819
 put the kitchens 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.279
 the why 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:51.889
 you could see 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.219
 3 clear 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.389
 without having to face that is to say the real one you are not far away either 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.979
 precisely percent done a job that there was a video the passes he touches 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.449
 make a montage 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.529
 today I had a job 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.789
 It is very curious 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.840
 of some extensions little things on the top 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.079
 and at the bottom he has supposed rubber 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.969
 i this girl who has had this lady who has come 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.799
 it came from the palms 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.579
 prize with his daughter 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.280
 she spends the weekend but came to put on the extensions and came from 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:27.419
 palmas real city does not get you that far 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.419

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.149
 percent 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.149
 I really do not know the real city is here is here next 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.999
 then for a hundred yes yes you are 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:40.880
 you can send me 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.969
 another e-mail 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.739
 with a heavy rain 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.569
 the amount of what you have 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.299
 I thought at the time I took the measurements you heard, see how much hair you have 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.350
 I can advise a few blocks 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.169
 this is fine hair 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.999
 well that here they can not be put perfectly 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.680
 keratin care you can perfectly put the extensions 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.429
 adhesive also 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.739
 it can be put to you also depends on 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 whatever you want them to last you 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.429
 mcqueen 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.569
 but always 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.180
 that she can help you 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.669
 the hundred the care of goods and the care that you are going to need 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.859
 besides those bad experiences dismissed before 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.660
 because many times 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.160
 maybe the technique is the correct the best extensions p 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.760
 they are correctly set for maintenance 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.520
 it's not the right anyway you tell me they put the extensions 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.460
 very close to the scalp 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.779
 well, there, too 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.779
 I'm not going to say it's a mistake 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.970
 if you have a sensitive scalp because I have not been is not local ecuador 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.820
 forever 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.120
 any type of extensions that are put 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 you have to leave 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.900
 half centimeter of 10 centimeters from the extension to your hair 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.380
 so they do not bother you here so you can do anything a life 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.120
 completely normal 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.320
 surrender I say for a fine hair the worn ball perfectly those of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.320
 Keratin go perfectly the kitchens go perfectly 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.150
 It also depends on your pace of life 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.499
 if your rhythm of life 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.070
 sct the base but every day 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.409
 and what are you running from one place to another and such and such 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.449
 Of course things were not right 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.289
 because the stitched extensions the only requirement the only precaution that 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.450
 you need them 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.860
 is that when you wash your hair 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.400
 and that poster is very good your own hair 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.320
 because you can be a full day together 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.170
 and that is counterproductive 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.430
 because your own hair can be rethought 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.909
 but all the other ones 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.070
 percent and those of keratin 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.330
 after the neighborhood that starts the good weather you can wash your hair 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.940
 and go out with the provoked because like they are going to be able 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.069
 if you are going to dry your own hair 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.300
 because he is not in the head of the list 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.159
 nor this one 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.409
 and like the Chinese textiles what this the third and puppets 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.319
 that trick of garay ac 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.430
 let your hair take 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.419
 I take summer and it does not dry 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.240
 Of course this cinema can be imposed on you 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.469
 what was said 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.809
 send me a picture here I tell you it's highly 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.900
 that the pp indicates that it will go well 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.200
 and of course I already tell you real city is just around the corner 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200
