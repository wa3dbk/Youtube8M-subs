00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello everyone with you channel model review 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.810
 or derma taizen and this mysterious 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.850
 the box never contains 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.130
 believe that you probably know it 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.370
 headphones from the company 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 about which costs 55 thousand rubles for 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.949
 actually the box was bigger in my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:30.109
 The set was such a case in which 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 lining contains two things Kobelka 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.850
 there was also such an instruction on 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.590
 instruction may be missing 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 Iâ€™ll show you these 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.309
 headphones so open expensive short 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 expensive and rich now I think that many 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.070
 all luxury headphones will be surprised 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
 separate topic for conversation 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 almost like a good swiss watch 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 because I usually used to watch 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.290
 see here such boxes are expensive 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 headphones short of course simpler 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.990
 silicone touches the most 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.670
 in luxury device 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 also present anywhere he has not gone 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.439
 headphones themselves this is a brand new self 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.979
 decided to show you so that you 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.900
 have seen 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.220
 well packaged and so here's the cable 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.509
 which is on the screed why look cable 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 It has 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.759
 braid braid is very good if 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 talk about how to connect here 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.810
 he connects so now we have this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.530
 let's go further and I want to say 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.079
 that I created these completely unnecessary 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 Unpacking things with you these dear 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.010
 headphones 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 companies that appear on the market about 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.590
 by known blu-ray players for you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.009
 probably smart phones like this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.650
 metal screw design 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.000
 designs too this metal looks 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 it is quite simple then 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.650
 sound insulation here is not ideal when 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.450
 playing well i have external noise but 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.970
 this is again subjective to someone 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.860
 I like someone, but such headphones 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.060
 you probably never tell them 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.709
 how much do they cost 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.800
 right earpiece and left earpiece 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.230
 Now I will connect just flew like that 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.360
 it will look look it will be here 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.030
 as follows what's with these headphones 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.350
 interesting but firstly usually 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.650
 Headphone speakers use 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.570
 magnetic drivers are used here 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.970
 fundamentally different technology which 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.049
 known by top device it 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.600
 planar planar magnet technology 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.790
 what is it if the copper coil in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.870
 ordinary speakers she like 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.420
 winding up there goes a cone here well 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.410
 as well as on and on all labels for example 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.060
 layer 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.980
 only conducting it on the surface and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.049
 the sound is not given a cone but throughout 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.780
 cylinder surface we essentially 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.640
 Well, there are still some advantages about this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.510
 technology will talk more in the review 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 of this device in terms of household 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.790
 yes you know headphones are things very 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.019
 subjective also like a toothbrush 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.100
 most toothbrushes like 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.049
 depending there on the price class I and 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.530
 I do not even know what brands exist but 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.820
 any aquafresh for example here with 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.660
 headphones example is the same situation 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.250
 individual they are very different can 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.890
 like may not like on what 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.690
 the more a person listens the better for him 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.970
 taste is formed if you change from 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.190
 ordinary headphones on here such 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.160
 of course amazing sound quality 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.100
 will you realize that what you heard 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.070
 up to this point 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.740
 it's just nonsense probably worth it 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.150
 money's earphones tough question 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.680
 because like any luxury product 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.990
 probably Markov by in Russia almost 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.770
 not known in the world it is known a little 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.470
 more 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.440
 if we talk about sales of these headphones 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.410
 already sold for m1 they are sold for 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.660
 worldwide best sales in terms of 300 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.090
 pieces per month in america for sale pieces 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.970
 one hundred fifty two hundred per month price in 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.520
 America, respectively , somewhere 1700 1800 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.170
 dollars in japan is a little over 2 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.110
 thousand dollars well what can I say 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.210
 listen to how they sound because the video 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.980
 I give you the sound of these headphones 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.740
 I can not headphones 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.830
 very , very high quality in my 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.810
 look they are one of the best i have 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.450
 This is a class top headphones 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.840
 sennheiser they sound very good these 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.910
 headphones are quite comparable but sound 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.900
 a little different clean good 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.550
 balanced sound for you it sounds 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.170
 like some 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.090
 abracadabra because she really 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.580
 you have to listen to it all individually 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.190
 everyone has their own ears 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.240
 preferences someone likes it louder 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.520
 someone is quieter 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.940
 but definitely from a technical point 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.540
 The view of these headphones flaws per se 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.890
 don't they are well assembled they are good 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.720
 this aluminum frame sounds 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.200
 provides a fairly good suspension 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.610
 at the same time they have headphones 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.800
 ears when hanging a small gap 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.420
 that is, they adapt to your 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.890
 head shape in all senses 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.110
 interesting device interesting 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.030
 device not only by technology from 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.950
 technology is known there are in a number 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.490
 Headphones from other manufacturers of the same 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.470
 price range cheaper but 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.430
 Interesting to those on our eyes 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.020
 trying to create a new luxury brand 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.390
 luxury in headphones and in principle 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.610
 if they called these headphones hers by 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.340
 came up with some name of another company 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.490
 I think everything would happen even more 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.900
 interesting 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.050
 people would say what 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.470
 quality sound the other whale goes to 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.380
 luxury 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:37.250
 while it does not look quite justified 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.080
 but I think in 5-10 years we are no longer 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.690
 Chinese companies will be surprised 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.569
 who are engaged in luxury is of course 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.930
 interesting I must pay tribute to the Chinese 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.550
 who is not afraid to try new niches in 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.889
 review will talk in detail about these 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.210
 headphones here you saw that in 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:57.740
 bundled as they look and in general 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.069
 interesting device from all points 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.099
 view though of course in terms of 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:07.610
 common sense buy not known 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:09.530
 the brand is dangerous especially for lovers 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.380
 quality sound unknown 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.409
 buy these headphones for 55 thousand 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.389
 rubles in Russia it seems to me a little 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.000
 a little bust on the other hand good 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.940
 products are always worth the money on it all 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.539
 read the review on the website good luck and good 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.310
 moods 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:27.310
 always your ginger taizen bye
