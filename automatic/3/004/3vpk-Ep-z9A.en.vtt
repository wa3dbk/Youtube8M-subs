00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
so they mess it up but it's kind of cool
actually<00:00:48.480> cuz<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> find<00:00:49.350> ones<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
actually cuz now if you find ones that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
actually cuz now if you find ones that
have<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.910> gel<00:00:51.239> light<00:00:51.680> three<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> sitting<00:00:54.899> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there they're probably fake so that's

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.760

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
part with this to me this is the best

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.790 
part with this to me this is the best
25th<00:05:13.940> anniversary<00:05:14.510> that's<00:05:15.229> come<00:05:15.470> out<00:05:15.500> thus

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
25th anniversary that's come out thus

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.650 
25th anniversary that's come out thus
far<00:05:15.830> but<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.729> media's<00:05:17.030> are<00:05:17.150> pretty<00:05:17.330> nice<00:05:17.419> too

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
far but the media's are pretty nice too

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.190 
far but the media's are pretty nice too
but<00:05:18.560> these<00:05:18.800> are<00:05:18.979> by<00:05:19.220> far<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.460> best<00:05:19.930> best<00:05:20.930> story

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
but these are by far the best best story

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.770 
but these are by far the best best story
behind<00:05:21.410> them<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.800> think<00:05:21.860> also<00:05:22.900> best<00:05:23.900> colorway

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
behind them I think also best colorway

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.330 
behind them I think also best colorway
what<00:05:26.780> can<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:26.930> say<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.380> know<00:05:27.710> I'm<00:05:27.889> very<00:05:27.950> biased

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
what can I say I know I'm very biased

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.339 
what can I say I know I'm very biased
the<00:05:28.610> concepts<00:05:29.060> but<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.660> know<00:05:29.780> they<00:05:29.930> do<00:05:29.990> things

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
the concepts but you know they do things

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.029 
the concepts but you know they do things
amazing<00:05:32.139> so<00:05:33.139> I<00:05:33.169> made<00:05:33.320> some<00:05:33.470> kind<00:05:33.590> of<00:05:33.710> collab

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
amazing so I made some kind of collab

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.629 
amazing so I made some kind of collab
Kings<00:05:34.419> but<00:05:35.419> anyways<00:05:36.070> hopefully<00:05:37.070> for<00:05:37.400> some<00:05:37.430> of
