00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
together on a pretty regular basis back

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.830 
together on a pretty regular basis back
in<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.530> 40s<00:05:37.920> and<00:05:38.040> 50s<00:05:38.190> as<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.240> grew<00:05:39.450> up<00:05:39.480> around

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
in the 40s and 50s as I grew up around

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.900 
in the 40s and 50s as I grew up around
that<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.440> then<00:05:40.590> just<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.310> idea<00:05:41.640> of<00:05:41.730> bringing

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
that and then just the idea of bringing

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.330 
that and then just the idea of bringing
them<00:05:42.120> everybody<00:05:42.510> together<00:05:42.690> we'd<00:05:43.320> worked<00:05:43.560> half

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
them everybody together we'd worked half

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.930 
them everybody together we'd worked half
a<00:05:44.460> dozen<00:05:44.870> programs<00:05:45.870> together<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:47.130> you<00:05:47.850> know

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
a dozen programs together and you know

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.630 
a dozen programs together and you know
four<00:05:48.450> or<00:05:48.510> five<00:05:48.660> groups<00:05:48.990> on<00:05:49.320> there<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.830> we

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
four or five groups on there and we

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.880 
four or five groups on there and we
thought<00:05:50.790> it<00:05:51.510> was<00:05:51.690> just<00:05:51.810> I<00:05:52.200> think<00:05:52.380> just<00:05:52.740> an

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
thought it was just I think just an

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.830 
thought it was just I think just an
inspired<00:05:53.400> thought<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:54.300> bring<00:05:54.450> everybody

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
inspired thought to bring everybody

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.180 
inspired thought to bring everybody
together<00:05:55.170> I<00:05:55.380> think<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.650> was<00:05:55.740> actually<00:05:55.980> JD

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
together I think it was actually JD

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.670 
together I think it was actually JD
Sumner's<00:05:56.730> idea<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.330> do<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:58.140> he<00:05:58.380> was<00:05:58.500> in<00:05:58.650> the

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
