my<00:00:38.879> other<00:00:39.030> previous<00:00:39.600> collecting<00:00:39.899> tip<00:00:40.050> was

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
my other previous collecting tip was

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
my other previous collecting tip was
called<00:00:40.610> well<00:00:41.610> basically<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> have

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
called well basically you have to have

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.819 
called well basically you have to have
knowledge<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> games<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.410> need<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.710> how

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
knowledge of games you need to know how

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.319 
knowledge of games you need to know how
much<00:00:44.010> they're<00:00:44.160> worth<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> knew<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
much they're worth so if you knew that a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.250 
much they're worth so if you knew that a
lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.870> worth<00:00:45.960> twenty<00:00:46.230> dollars

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
lot of them are worth twenty dollars

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
lot of them are worth twenty dollars
each<00:00:46.680> even<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> them<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
each even if you have some of them you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
each even if you have some of them you
can<00:00:48.840> keep<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> ones<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> then

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
can keep the ones you want and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.590 
can keep the ones you want and then
solve<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.969> ones<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> try<00:00:51.420> make<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
solve the other ones to try make a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
solve the other ones to try make a
profit<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.680> example<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> remember<00:00:53.250> finding

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
profit so for example I remember finding
