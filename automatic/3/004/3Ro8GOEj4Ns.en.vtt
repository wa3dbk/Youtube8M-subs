00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.830
 with the launch of windows 8 with 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.820
 Microsoft is also launching its own tablet line 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.950
 to rig 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.630
 this surface tablet line we'll go 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.509
 previously examined with care and 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.160
 service 8 arti is artie version and 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.320
 has windows 8 rt and as one 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.210
 slightly different variant than our other now 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.470
 have hands and windows 8 pro de 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.029
 surface pro 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.099
 and we have this in the coming weeks 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.320
 comprehensive review the surface pro is one 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.939
 variant of the artie version and major 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.770
 fault in between is that this is over the in 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.660
 touch it features this variant that we are in 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.880
 has our hands or has a core i5 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.260
 and intel and you run particularly fast and 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.220
 he also has 4 gigabytes on 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.920
 got a ram 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.120
 that in combination with windows 8 pro 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.520
 ensures that just a very powerful one 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 tablet and that there is actually a limit 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.020
 so a laptop and tablet very much 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.950
 faded and my god i connects to that 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.870
 to play 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.910
 so pro variant name also focused on the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.620
 business customers especially the universe too 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.880
 with your price tag but also with 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.470
 its architecture 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.940
 because it has been able to input chip 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.380
 namely normal applications that too 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.869
 groups of normal windows 8 computer 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.369
 turn here also be turned up think 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.740
 but also very important 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.320
 application for business and SMEs such as 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.940
 applications or other applications well 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.470
 that was not the active variant because 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.120
 he has other architecture 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
 from him and that is a very big one 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.229
 advantage does mean that the price is the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.549
 seams is this tablet name of markets 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.560
 or the surface pro 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.909
 you start at around 150 euros and that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.900
 is a lot of money 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.450
 we also have you in more expensive ones 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.060
 variant with awe 20 gigabytes sd in der 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 a this sd version there so just that you 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.580
 have much more memory but so do you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.090
 still want our eleven hundred euros 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.470
 count down 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.720
 well that is a lot of money for one 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.909
 tablet a woman asia for the same 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.440
 Money can buy a great laptop 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.360
 ask a bit of why of course 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.159
 are keep this going to buy that would be the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.110
 King week I find out how 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.600
 now you go there is that ours is impressed 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.820
 of this microsoft surface tablet 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.189
 pro from microsoft is a bit heavier than the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 artie version just experiencing that 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.330
 there is more specification and that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 also just needs better cooling 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.560
 Well what about a back here 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.689
 for small opening and that sit there 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.549
 fan in but I would be smart about that 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.590
 reflected in the fans that runs namely 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.519
 can certain side on an air flow 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.599
 push off 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.430
 if you have it on my hands like that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.230
 the airflow will go up every 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.580
 summer men 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.989
 all of the air such once again go to the top 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.370
 and automatically flow it naturally too 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.260
 screen e 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.519
 that is all very interesting and it 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 just work all very smoothly 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.629
 quickly give us the way as a tablet 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 I mainly had windows and he had it 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.060
 is perhaps as fast as 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.890
 example an apple ipad 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.150
 that certainly meant saying it all 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.980
 really very smooth 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 just looks very straight from home 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.950
 just have everything in place on that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 just really dealing with that fat one 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.739
 Processor 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.269
 this team variant is therefore quite a bit 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.220
 heavier than a normal variant there 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.200
 where the active versions 680 is evil 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 French this is almost a kilo and that is 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.810
 quite a lot 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.160
 he is fairly heavier, ahead of him 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.450
 an apple ipad 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 it just really good construction and it too 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.109
 from now on back that you again 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.269
 the well-known coffin and has been given that 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.590
 this pro also knows about the artifex 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.640
 variant is also delivered again 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.989
 in the pin 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.879
 so that you are you can just screens 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.310
 have serve and that actually works like that 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.640
 easy so you can do things right 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.680
 To adjust 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.239
 feels nice too easy here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.500
 process my writing and texts and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.540
 that it is also handy 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.340
 this profile also received and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.810
 not the artie version 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 why is this tablet actually 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.629
 important for business market such as 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.769
 said it has to do purely with 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.780
 architecture 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.519
 all normal apps for windows 8 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.900
 to be made and made to run 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.919
 also just this tablet 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900
 it just has the big advantage that 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.090
 when I feel like going to the application store 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.799
 for myjobs you go there much more 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.049
 can find an application for artie 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.250
 version that really saves a lot 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.989
 you just be almost all normal 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.620
 application to find his neighborhood just 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.060
 here on 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.590
 and also thanks to the full hd 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.400
 screen whatever is very tight 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.930
 looks like 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 they just loop it and watch it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.690
 to work with 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.579
 but I myself also provide one 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.959
 certain version of office you can 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.370
 also just be very positive with you 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.630
 the extended party also has to be 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.700
 with buyers that would like 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.739
 but nevertheless it is good and they 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.180
 very productive which we still have one 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.650
 Little weird thing is that you are still 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.450
 must switch between two 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.069
 you actually have this metro interface 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.200
 it just works very slick 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.760
 very nice and very well-arranged 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.410
 large buttons and are really just very 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.090
 modern but as soon as you for example 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.190
 want to start an office then you would go to 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.209
 the old interface of windows 7 go like 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.129
 a little weird you've got none 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.269
 start button whatever if your start button 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.310
 want to have then you have to appear 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.660
 then you can just pick it up again 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.099
 Continue but it just a little weird 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.840
 I always have to switch between those 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.900
 two versions and also just like you 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.190
 for example 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.440
 you will have to use over there 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.419
 give it a try go all those notifications 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.460
 just don't give it like for example 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.539
 now that just not right with you 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.910
 vink can operate so that's a bit 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.350
 separate but as long as you are just in the metro 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.800
 interface is nothing at all 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.180
 hand 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.500
 and also just turn things and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.330
 basically all other applications that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.729
 work really beautiful and also just see 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.259
 you look very good now our impression is 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.910
 of these tablets positive 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.740
 he is very expensive but again 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.360
 right very powerful the question is only 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.460
 Or he also imagined it as a laptop 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.410
 replace can throw then we are coming 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.880
 weeks of testing and so comprehensive and in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.080
 our next video review of this 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.080
 microsoft surface pro
