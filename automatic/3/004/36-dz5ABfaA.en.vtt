 unbelievable that I have climbed already go 5 that its 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.260
 video but 87 and there on my channel I explain 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.760
 why not upload the other two because 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.010
 they are the first ones that we climb so 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.470
 singles are very boring but 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.690
 we will upload them if we do not want 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.060
 subscribe but who check that too 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.190
 go on my channel and see them josh bazell 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 make an opportunity to pass to me 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.540
 truth channel I would appreciate it very much 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.460
 and also read 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.800
 by this means I thank my namesake 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.080
 that this opportunity is not given or 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.660
 take advantage of the truth is very good and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.270
 well that example is not so good that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.509
 let's say what starts so cool in one of 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.790
 those hills that there are so even 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.840
 to upload something to the channel there 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.910
 because he does not want about zeal and so 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.700
 that they also knew me because I 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.050
 just now I'm starting with a hundred 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.630
 yes 116 subscribers that is very good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.910
 for me it is very good but there are people 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.560
 with more subscribers like for example from 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.950
 read and you're going to get to 2000 already but 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 has to reach 22 thousand and I hope that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.770
 Help me in this project that 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.780
 I have I have planned your vigiló 45 and a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.670
 because among several carlos their diets are 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.100
 go up and has had the recorded part 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.290
 but at the mere hour now I go up 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.209
 because I say no because they are fans and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.190
 all that but if you are the sprint 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.080
 environment as I told you on my channel if 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.910
 you guys if they wanted me to climb 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 the gameplay those two members that do not 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.569
 uploaded to the super incredible and if 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.499
 you do not know what that is 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.650
 it was amazing are 35 30 or 35 I remember 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:11.379
 35 blows and dying followed thus 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.260
 difficult followed with a streak office 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.939
 but it 's 35 times if you this are more 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.920
 related to carlos use the 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.799
 verbs like that is like a love but I 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.709
 I feel like this is more like a 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.620
 little to see because they are 35 deaths and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.530
 they do not die as fast as the chaos 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.510
 lived and that this game very difficult for 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.740
 for me I am a great little man of the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.720
 line 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.000
 and more or less is what they will find 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.630
 on my channel this variety of styles and 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.330
 I planned this year to climb carlos úrico 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.550
 I told them but I do not have it 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.650
 link and document it live I 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.080
 but it has gone up in this week and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.690
 I hope he gives me the opportunity to 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.700
 upload this video to your channel and you know 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.010
 if you like edge, they have the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.810
 opportunity to be published and if not 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.580
 if you do not like my videos tell me 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.850
 because that also helped me a lot 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.670
 while some constructive criticism I 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.580
 It helped a lot when there were already several people 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.460
 who has not told me that the audio is not 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.700
 very good I already corrected it as right now 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.190
 that my computer broke down and 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.200
 was editing with the configuration of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.690
 madrid and they had not sony vegas made 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.820
 a mess but I was going up the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.920
 videos and what you see in what 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.930
 gave away my compu is going up for 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 commitment for then I do not 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.730
 they had sony vegas the audio they like more 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.590
 strong than enemies and a mess but 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.180
 well I have my computer returned is with 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.389
 the one that I'm recording 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.300
 healer the birds as you see her and I have 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.460
 good quality like right now and the people 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.560
 wants more and then locality that I 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.830
 I have this quality more than I handle 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.680
 my videos and then basically if they are my 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.310
 channel and I'll tell you a little about me as 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.020
 I am and I have seen youtube because I do everything 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.870
 that and I have been told by several people that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.940
 I'm ready to base this on 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.880
 you have said one more than the voice so the 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:13.490
 I have 14 years old and I play as 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.410
 I do not know how long I play halo a lot 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.980
 people have asked me for their advice from 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.620
 twists 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.170
 if I plan to upload this a guide 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.240
 with the dmr because many people tell me 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.280
 I play very well with him but it's not that 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.290
 can very well I have several tips that 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.110
 because they can serve as 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.090
 jump down example and all with 6 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.980
 of this month that I have served 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.540
 I'm going to make a video but there's also 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.370
 that know how to bend over and jump in 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.010
 right time for example when they are 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.100
 very close to the opponent you are in a duel 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.930
 I recommend seeing is best 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.020
 is spending but I sometimes jump 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.500
 because I get confused no no no like no 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.420
 I'm not telling you there I do not know which one I've 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 the one that is earned and how they will 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.410
 seen there one 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.980
 some repeated and there and then I already 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.520
 will finish the printed at 25 thousand 623 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.520
 easy and fast 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.139
 and well the gameplay is running out 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.479
 I hope they give me a good opportunity 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.970
 that chance be given the time to go through 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.680
 my channel there the ninja and then thanks for 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.099
