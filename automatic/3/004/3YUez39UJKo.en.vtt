00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:20.820
 and this man made the great launch 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 of rex a humanoid robot they say 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.180
 they are the most advanced because they 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 circulates synthetic blood and has several 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.599
 functional organs like the heart by 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 the kidneys the same type of organs that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.330
 we can already consider putting ourselves 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.470
 in our bodies when they are damaged 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 but he has the is still just a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 motor skeleton and in fact the same 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.309
 they say that one of the big flaws 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.800
 of development is that you can not simulate 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 the fine motor skills of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 man and that we are supposedly missing 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 many years to get to that something 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.170
 I'm not quite agree that the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 humanity already has all the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.170
 technological tools for 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.370
 develop 6 humanoid works by 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.930
 intelligence that we ourselves do not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 We are aware that we as 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.270
 social networks the amount information 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.770
 that we are giving all the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.329
 days when using those networks that if the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.949
 systematize and link as per 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.629
 example the technology of videogames 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 modern and new proposals for 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.809
 robotics you could reach things 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.100
 that we believe right now that they are 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.420
 movie for example bentos is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.309
 developing project that is a game 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.480
 of domestic use that like many robots 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.040
 current have a broad 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.660
 of movements and respond to various 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 stimuli recognizes human gestures and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.840
 can interpret the feelings of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.460
 the people and that if you are what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.230
 enough and you could mind rich you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 I could be buying it in the next 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.050
 years in other previous videos I 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 talked about the types of robots that 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.500
 they could develop but they all continue 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.300
 facing the same damn problem 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 what is its use because it has not been possible 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
 get to develop a robot 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.370
 massively that really solves a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.660
 need that humans can not 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.220
 solve by looking and we are many 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.720
 human that there is too much unemployment like 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.640
 to get us to replace people 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.410
 by robots but here is when it enters the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.430
 corrupt logic of our world with 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.840
 so many unemployed people are already 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.310
 dying of hunger and we 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.020
 inventing humanoids to do 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 our work with so many poor people in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 Colombia that arrives in Vienna without having 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.110
 what to eat and thousands of politicians and judges 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.310
 earning millionaire pensions because yes to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.540
 this is what I want to get to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 scandal that after years of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.210
 attempts so far is given the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 importance that it should have because it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.660
 returns a public issue that is that of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.190
 millionaire pensions in a country with 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.270
 as much poverty as Colombia some 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.860
 people of our taxes them 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.630
 We are paying 20 million pensions 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.280
 of monthly pesos and the worst is the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.870
 number of corrupt cases in which 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.610
 some advantageous people a month before 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.140
 leaving to retirement were changed 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.880
 put and end up earning pensions 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 millions without deserving it and like those 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.849
 there are many other modalities 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.470
 to the corrupt to win those 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.580
 pensions but to top this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.080
 blatant are those who have gone out to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.190
 talk about this topic the same as 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.569
 they take to pension with those pensions 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.340
 millionaire as comment well 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.790
 criticized by the former president of the council 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.659
 of State 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.659
 gustavo gÃ³mez 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.870
 that is, the fever is not in the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.519
 sheets extraordinary pensions 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.799
 they obey situations that the same 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.849
 democracy has generated and the other day 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.140
 he also went out again ladies 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.760
 saying that is that they had the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.829
 right to enjoy your pensions with 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.239
 your grandchildren and their children and as before 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.349
 of the end I decide that practically not 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.750
 they are to blame that Colombians 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.400
 be so stupid and that they are so 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.609
 good some with sites will not win 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 those 15 and 20 million pesos monthly 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.280
 poor kids they would not have to 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.480
 put gasoline in their trucks 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.470
 then this kind of comments 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.030
 they started to provoke quite 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.590
 outrage today sir have resulted 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.359
 garcia of the time column that yes 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.590
 he's telling you the truth in the face if 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.209
 we try is a high magistrate 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.549
 anyone would say that his statements 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.799
 are adjusted to false right are 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.230
 adjusted to the most obnoxious repudiable 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.810
 miserable likewise in the dictionary of 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.000
 etymologies I found that cynical comes 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.830
 the Greek and means dog this 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.200
 etymology I'm not to blame simply 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.599
 the transcribe method the intelligence of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.390
 translate the words of the magistrate 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.580
 this was what I understood I could not care 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.590
 sovereign that 80 percent of the 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 Colombians go hungry fools them 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.700
 who pay with sweat and blood our 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.130
 millionaire pensions up here my 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.300
 translation truth that I translated well the 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.120
 pressures of the congressmen we 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.730
 cost per month 12 thousand 500 million 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.190
 weights where does that money we 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.600
 prevents giving the link to the full text in 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.680
 the description but for good it's 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.450
 coming out people who have power of 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.950
 spread to say face these people 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.150
 which are some dogs would be rather 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.830
 stay quiet when they themselves 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.970
 they know that what they are doing is not good 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.319
 doing but then the real 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.120
 problem is that these are the people 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.170
 that laws are handled by people who 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.670
 are going to judge are the people who 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.650
 they will also earn those pensions or their 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.269
 friends and that's why they themselves do not leave 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.860
 to attack among them but they forget 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.450
 one thing that exists on facebook and 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.190
 twitter- they forget that in our 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.780
 time we judge now we are 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.269
 us because each one of us 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.769
 has a public voice that did not exist 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.389
 before because we are the ones who 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.800
 we generate the money with what they are paid 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.660
 we do see that there are millions of 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.270
 people who work their entire lives 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.920
 to grow old plunged into misery and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.440
 that because I started talking these pinches 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.660
 robots because that is the solution that is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.980
 the solution to the problem of use what 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.810
 scientists and engineers should 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.340
 strive to produce are humanoids 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.990
 to replace these corrupt ones 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.880
 abusive because they will surely do 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.350
 more objective intelligences because yes 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.790
 they cost us 20 million a month us 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.200
 we will know that these robots are not going to 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.300
 be wasting that money on 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.040
 trips and cars and properties and all 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.840
 those things that they do not deserve and even if 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.910
 it's funny, this is part of me 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.170
 optimistic vision about the future because 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.760
 as I said earlier chapter the 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.440
 speed of technological development the 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.970
 that we are not getting successful but 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.680
 that only young people can understand 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.390
 because a politician a leader or a 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.400
 mayor should not be elected by the 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.020
 eloquence of his speech or by the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.670
 amount of snacks or drink that 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.080
 regale we could have all our 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.820
 singular city if in the style of simcity 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.620
 put development plans that are 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.840
 proposing the mayors and they show 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.010
 a percentage effectiveness and crisis 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.990
 with candidates because if we are 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.760
 scientifically speaking that that yes 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.620
 will bring more results than others 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.090
 but who has time to develop 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.080
 those things and we should recognize the 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.850
 most our problems 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.020
 systematically because when the others 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.610
 they are clear and they are controlled 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.120
 they show with numbers and they would not look 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.620
 so many cases of corruption 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.720
 Now obviously I'm talking about 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.550
 utopias and ideal things but my point is 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.169
 that the tools are already 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.669
 technology already exists but still 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.960
 we continue to deceive ourselves by believing 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.600
 that to have a good leader 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.910
 we have to have acts of faith and wait 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.220
 I did make good decisions and to 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.840
 end this cyberbullying the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.090
 drawing i vote happy the day that a 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.410
 robot is running for mayor because I know 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.449
 that if he is dedicated to stealing all the 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.460
 national budget will do so by calculating 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.470
 investing in what he considers to be 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.630
 is more beneficial to us and not 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.610
 will go running to buy a ferrari that 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.080
 it's all for this chapter if you liked it 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.910
 click on like tell me 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.919
 what do you think in the comments below 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.900
 about these pensions and about the robots 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.000
 participate in the hashtag about the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.199
 pensions and those things because remember 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.970
 that now you have the power to 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.740
 decide what news is 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.990
 they deserve to be spread because the
