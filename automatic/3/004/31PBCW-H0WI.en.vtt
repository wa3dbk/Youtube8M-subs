00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it you can give it stick and you can't

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.949 
it you can give it stick and you can't
damage<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.860> factory<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:39.269> say<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.600> is

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
damage it the factory they say this is

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.690 
damage it the factory they say this is
three<00:02:40.230> hours<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.620> I've<00:02:40.709> got<00:02:40.830> much<00:02:41.400> more<00:02:41.610> than

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
three hours and I've got much more than

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.979 
three hours and I've got much more than
three<00:02:41.880> hours<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.239> when<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> inadvertently

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
three hours of it when I inadvertently

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.870 
three hours of it when I inadvertently
left<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.560> overnight<00:02:43.769> but<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.610> screen

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
left it on overnight but the screen

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.630 
left it on overnight but the screen
wasn't<00:02:45.209> powered<00:02:46.019> up<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.709> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
wasn't powered up there and so it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.360 
wasn't powered up there and so it
depends<00:02:48.299> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.019> load<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.510> switches<00:02:51.750> off<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
depends on the load it switches off in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.420 
depends on the load it switches off in
under<00:02:53.370> ten<00:02:53.549> seconds<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.500> for<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
under ten seconds so I think for the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.320 
under ten seconds so I think for the
price<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:57.079> regulated<00:02:58.079> for<00:02:58.140> money
