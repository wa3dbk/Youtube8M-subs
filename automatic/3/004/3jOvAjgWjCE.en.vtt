00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.549
 welcome sax in this new video myself 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.070
 I'm starter guys today I'm up here 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.919
 gta online to do the second test 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.840
 speed on the indicated bingham or 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.880
 the new bike he reached with the di 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.000
 pay off the crime pays part 2 bs 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.009
 labaki 801 because the second video 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.320
 because your video was the company 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.570
 indicated ubs to the kennel and I leave you the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.670
 link in rotation propellers description of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.220
 that video so go and see why it is 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.930
 very, very interesting as a test of 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.089
 speed 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.440
 since the situation is reversed from a 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.059
 moment to another 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.229
 well guys i'm here with these tests of 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.379
 speed precisely with the rich b 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.659
 the I indicator on medical life is z 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.150
 willig on his abbati enhanced to 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.860
 maximum on both bikes are 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.960
 enhanced to the maximum good guys 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.600
 here we are on the starting line 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.460
 hesitates willings practically as we have 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.130
 made to start as in the first video 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 easy no then practically me today from 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.310
 those we know the phone 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.729
 we decide by minute to leave for 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.160
 example the 20 minute and we leave at 18 20 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.740
 just snaps and 20 minutes from not 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.350
 make starting mistakes then guys 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.520
 we left the party already exceeds us in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.530
 acceleration 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.480
 we are left behind and unfortunately I think 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.090
 that we are destined to remain behind 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.550
 since the abbot is always recovering 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.530
 more territory is precisely eating the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.720
 street and is making us eat the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.090
 powder 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.490
 so it seems to me that the result is clear 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.100
 we lost against the crazy but the boys 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.260
 here comes the trick of cables 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.540
 indicator possesses one thing that does not 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.720
 all bikes even have to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.460
 better bikes or turbo the tench 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.890
 indicated in fact stands out from the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.720
 other way for the turbo there is only 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.510
 another bike with the turbo or the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 lectro apple we will soon be going to 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.690
 also challenge that then guys 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.909
 we will do another race with the bat ii con 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.920
 the treat, however, this time with the turbo 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.010
 and we'll see who wins so we left 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 at minute 55 z willy xc exceeds with the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.760
 its base we both started at 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.980
 same time so don't break the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.109
 asshole puts the turbo and in short the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.950
 recovery in an instant z willis with the 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.870
 its base 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.299
 on the contrary, I pass it and put it 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.330
 to say and look, I'm not in front of you 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.459
 in short, you are stronger for the boys 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.680
 tell her take revenge they smash your ass a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.510
 everyone with the turbo then guys 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
 the tench shows me core is very fast 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.879
 with the turbo much less fast without 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.769
 turbo however this is obvious let's say why 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.540
 if there is a turbo I think it is useful 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.560
 something to make the bike more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.390
 fast 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 guys, I remind you that it is legal 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.810
 however turbo cannot be used therefore it is 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.060
 a little half a rip-off 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.349
 but it's ok so guys before 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.959
 conclude the video that I invite you to 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.230
 go through the first speed test done 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.819
 the other day against a cuchu that is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.650
 another very fast bike 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.420
 indeed perhaps almost more difficult then 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.040
 go see it because it's a lot 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.900
 interesting as a speed test 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.400
 the girls the entrance of zvi leaks that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.319
 worked with me to do this test 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.940
 of speed passed for its channel 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.970
 since it will load a very video 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.400
 interesting between the project 20 or the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.159
 super who added in the dlc and the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.099
 crime pays part 2 against osiris 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.650
 to the various super vehicles like the gen back 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.510
 and if all goes well it will load it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 support itself so be careful 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.109
 subscribe to his channel or not 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.579
 miss the next video that 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 will load just today 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.299
 so don't miss it I recommend you 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.069
 I leave the link in notation on the screen is

 the link in the description of his channel 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.849
 because unfortunately up until now has not ha 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.680
 loaded the speed test video 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.299
 we can end up with video 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.079
 i can any of the video and us there 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.629
 we can say goodbye 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.040
 so guys said that I vida 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.690
 subscribe to my channel if you are not 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.269
 still enrolled so do not miss indeed 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.560
 contents of past owners for the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.209
 canalis from willis as mentioned above 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.590
 let the video calm if the video is there 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.750
 liked there was helpful there was 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.459
 clear there was very very beautiful 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.650
 in short, I liked what the fuck 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.849
 they leave me the same like like 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.410
 give yourself below letting me know what 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.579
 think of the test what you think 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.180
 of the new bike 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.370
 if you have a lip, he has found a worthy adversary 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.870
 if the turbo seems like a crap to me or 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.389
 no to boys 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.070
 let me know if over the text against 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.500
 the lector you want me to do another 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.680
 test another test against another bike 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.479
 or against another vehicle with a 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.220
 helium against a plane because it is a lot 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.050
 interesting as what since 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.660
 planes are usually much, much more 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.070
 fast cars and what else 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.169
 you want because it is very interesting 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.940
 this bike with the turbo then guys 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.320
 And let okay in small talk has 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.150
 having said that we cannot see ourselves at 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.150
 next video and bye bye
