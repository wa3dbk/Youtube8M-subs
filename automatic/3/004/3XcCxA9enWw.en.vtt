how<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> film<00:03:29.780> underscored<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
how the film underscored that the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.380 
how the film underscored that the
sibling<00:03:31.410> relationship<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:32.370> very<00:03:32.820> important

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
sibling relationship is very important

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.110 
sibling relationship is very important
and<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.900> tremendously<00:03:34.860> supportive<00:03:35.520> and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
and can be tremendously supportive and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.580 
and can be tremendously supportive and
that's<00:03:36.240> why<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.540> shouldn't<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.230> throw<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
that's why you shouldn't just throw it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.950 
that's why you shouldn't just throw it
away<00:03:37.710> it's<00:03:38.040> worth<00:03:38.280> fighting<00:03:38.580> for<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.750> like

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
away it's worth fighting for and I like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.240 
away it's worth fighting for and I like
the<00:03:40.140> way<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.380> siblings<00:03:40.740> here<00:03:40.860> were<00:03:40.950> portrayed

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the way the siblings here were portrayed

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.640 
the way the siblings here were portrayed
so<00:03:41.580> much<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.270> made<00:03:42.480> me<00:03:42.600> call<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.930> sister<00:03:42.990> after

unintentionally or accidentally hurt
others<00:05:17.600> sometimes<00:05:18.110> intentionally<00:05:18.949> but<00:05:19.370> you

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
others sometimes intentionally but you

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.850 
others sometimes intentionally but you
know<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.729> happens<00:05:20.150> that's<00:05:20.360> again<00:05:20.870> realistic

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
know that happens that's again realistic

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.010 
know that happens that's again realistic
but<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.639> think<00:05:22.820> underneath<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.510> all<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.840> nice

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
but I think underneath it all the nice

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.230 
but I think underneath it all the nice
thing<00:05:24.290> was<00:05:24.410> that<00:05:24.560> they<00:05:24.740> are<00:05:24.919> both<00:05:25.580> really<00:05:26.060> nice

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
thing was that they are both really nice

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.600 
thing was that they are both really nice
people<00:05:26.840> this<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.470> just<00:05:27.500> stuff<00:05:28.070> that<00:05:28.220> happens

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
people this is just stuff that happens

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.360 
people this is just stuff that happens
in<00:05:28.820> life<00:05:29.530> that's<00:05:30.530> why<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:31.100> makes<00:05:31.220> it

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
in life that's why I think it makes it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.610 
in life that's why I think it makes it
so<00:05:31.490> easy<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:32.000> identify<00:05:32.150> with<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.320> was<00:05:33.410> just

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
so easy to identify with and it was just

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.920 
so easy to identify with and it was just
really<00:05:33.740> refreshing<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.460> see<00:05:34.490> some<00:05:35.449> genuinely

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
really refreshing to see some genuinely

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.260 
really refreshing to see some genuinely
nice<00:05:36.169> people<00:05:36.470> portrayed<00:05:37.400> on<00:05:37.639> screen<00:05:37.970> they

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
nice people portrayed on screen they

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.080 
nice people portrayed on screen they
weren't<00:05:38.419> narcissistic<00:05:39.229> or<00:05:39.490> egotistical<00:05:40.490> and

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
weren't narcissistic or egotistical and

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.460 
weren't narcissistic or egotistical and
I<00:05:41.330> think<00:05:41.540> maybe<00:05:41.660> some<00:05:41.930> people<00:05:42.050> could<00:05:42.290> make<00:05:42.380> the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
I think maybe some people could make the

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.750 
I think maybe some people could make the
argument<00:05:42.889> that<00:05:42.919> they<00:05:43.070> were<00:05:43.280> but<00:05:43.430> they<00:05:43.550> didn't

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
argument that they were but they didn't

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.100 
argument that they were but they didn't
come<00:05:43.880> across<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.389> way<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.570> me<00:05:44.810> they<00:05:44.960> both

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
come across that way to me they both

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.909 
come across that way to me they both
seemed<00:05:45.440> like<00:05:45.860> really<00:05:46.400> nice<00:05:46.940> people<00:05:47.750> also<00:05:48.740> I

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
seemed like really nice people also I

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.379 
seemed like really nice people also I
think<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.250> shout<00:05:49.460> out<00:05:49.490> has<00:05:49.729> to<00:05:49.760> go<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.060> Luke

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
think a shout out has to go to Luke

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.540 
think a shout out has to go to Luke
Wilson<00:05:50.900> who<00:05:51.380> also<00:05:51.710> does<00:05:51.860> a<00:05:51.889> very<00:05:51.979> good<00:05:52.340> job<00:05:52.490> in

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
Wilson who also does a very good job in

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.030 
Wilson who also does a very good job in
his<00:05:52.790> supporting<00:05:53.270> role<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:53.720> I<00:05:54.080> think<00:05:54.350> um<00:05:54.590> the

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
his supporting role and I think um the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.529 
his supporting role and I think um the
great<00:05:55.220> thing<00:05:55.370> about<00:05:55.430> his<00:05:55.700> character<00:05:56.210> is<00:05:56.389> that

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
great thing about his character is that

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.690 
great thing about his character is that
it<00:05:56.630> showcases<00:05:57.080> how<00:05:57.350> sometimes<00:05:57.590> good<00:05:58.100> guys<00:05:58.310> are

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
it showcases how sometimes good guys are

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.690 
it showcases how sometimes good guys are
their<00:05:59.210> own<00:05:59.300> worst<00:05:59.510> enemy<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.590> also<00:06:01.370> think

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
their own worst enemy I also think

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.879 
their own worst enemy I also think

Johnson<00:06:04.400> here<00:06:04.639> he<00:06:05.300> doesn't<00:06:05.449> really<00:06:05.630> have<00:06:05.720> a

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
Johnson here he doesn't really have a

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.629 
Johnson here he doesn't really have a
strong<00:06:06.139> voice<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.770> don't<00:06:06.919> really<00:06:07.070> feel<00:06:07.370> his

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
strong voice you don't really feel his

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.190 
strong voice you don't really feel his
presence<00:06:07.880> when<00:06:08.570> you're<00:06:08.690> watching<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.110> movie

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
presence when you're watching the movie

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.960 
presence when you're watching the movie
but<00:06:09.530> somebody<00:06:10.250> had<00:06:10.370> to<00:06:10.490> guide<00:06:10.639> all<00:06:10.850> these

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
but somebody had to guide all these

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.640 
but somebody had to guide all these
actors<00:06:11.300> through<00:06:11.600> this<00:06:11.750> and<00:06:12.289> I<00:06:12.350> know<00:06:12.410> that

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
actors through this and I know that

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.920 
actors through this and I know that
films<00:06:13.130> like<00:06:13.250> this<00:06:13.430> are<00:06:13.639> largely<00:06:13.940> improvised

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
films like this are largely improvised

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.080 
films like this are largely improvised
and<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:16.010> doesn't<00:06:16.310> come<00:06:16.490> across<00:06:16.610> that<00:06:16.850> way

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
and it doesn't come across that way

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.330 
and it doesn't come across that way
sometimes<00:06:17.539> it<00:06:17.690> does<00:06:17.870> but<00:06:18.110> this<00:06:18.289> seemed<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.860> mean

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
sometimes it does but this seemed I mean

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.620 
sometimes it does but this seemed I mean
it<00:06:19.520> would<00:06:19.669> be<00:06:19.700> hard<00:06:19.789> for<00:06:20.090> me<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.210> tell<00:06:20.419> if<00:06:20.539> this

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
it would be hard for me to tell if this

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.480 
it would be hard for me to tell if this
was<00:06:20.690> scripted<00:06:21.200> or<00:06:21.260> improvised<00:06:21.740> so<00:06:22.099> really

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
was scripted or improvised so really

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.940 
was scripted or improvised so really
nice<00:06:22.639> work<00:06:22.940> all<00:06:23.270> around<00:06:23.930> I<00:06:24.139> would<00:06:24.560> definitely

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
nice work all around I would definitely

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.520 
nice work all around I would definitely
recommend<00:06:25.039> you<00:06:25.400> see<00:06:25.610> this<00:06:25.760> at<00:06:25.970> some<00:06:26.180> point
