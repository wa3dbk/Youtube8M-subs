well<00:05:33.449> but<00:05:33.960> I'm<00:05:34.139> not<00:05:34.350> sure<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.650> know<00:05:34.830> what<00:05:35.100> the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
well but I'm not sure I know what the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.700 
well but I'm not sure I know what the
song<00:05:35.580> was<00:05:35.610> about<00:05:36.060> so<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.630> speak<00:05:36.960> because<00:05:37.229> the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
words I think the text could be more

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.320 
words I think the text could be more
developed<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.040> use<00:05:41.250> more<00:05:41.460> lips<00:05:41.760> teeth

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
developed so just use more lips teeth
