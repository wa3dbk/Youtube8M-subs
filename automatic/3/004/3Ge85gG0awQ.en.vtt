00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 in the pp 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.760
 a good new video is again in a 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.860
 that is still in demolition and nothing is 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.550
 two streaks of two low chains 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.580
 followed is two lives then just kill me 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.470
 I took out the other one and there I did not like anything 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.939
 quite the game because I was 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.930
 testing the shotgun with the charger 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.110
 big she that with him with the gun 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.280
 there are many times that the b-23 did not 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.450
 tried to kill with the shotgun more than 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.700
 nothing and then said I'll try like this with 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.860
 only three bullets three more cartridges but 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.560
 well still or pretty good because 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.990
 we can load two bullets or that and follow 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.360
 giving giving cane and as you see asks for everything 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.850
 the 'rais' faunes is a pass to the mode 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.640
 of this one in demolition is that it is not stopping 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.090
 I'm super flawed is the mode 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.699
 this one in domain when it touches domain then 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.649
 what happens to me is I usually get me as 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.869
 if it were demolition and that the king is 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.759
 to search well followed there is the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.369
 first chain of casualties and as you see 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.189
 they came back to do I went again for 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.940
 in here is a good place to put the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.940
 law 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 is to fall to this one because that's the way out and 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 you catch them all the time and I like it 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.990
 more enter right because they continue 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.760
 appearing there as you see if we enter 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.650
 on the left they appear to us 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.320
 end of the staircase and we're 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.750
 Fucked but this part is brushed 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.970
 pretty good and nothing I wanted to tell you 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.400
 that thing about the play that I saw many that 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.880
 tell me in the comments that 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 I added that your gamer is that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.970
 is it and I still do not have the nick that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.700
 creator in nothing so when you create it 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.260
 rest assured that I'll say it around here and I'll 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.120
 add jce you because if I have to 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.530
 go 1-1 adding that would be chaos 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.680
 and you have left nothing more than 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.050
 departure but here it is, then, take me out 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.110
 two super low more but that's what if 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.240
 do not go by the site touches 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
 Well, maybe he sees you, you charge two and 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.290
 they kill you three and they kill you and it's all 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.300
 so what I was trying is the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.790
 vest he 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.680
 for the pineapples and that because in this map 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 if not, if you do not wear it, it's that 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.560
 they swell pineapples to c4 if everything and the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 true that if it took pretty well what 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 what happens that being used to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.910
 get the shotgun with lightweight then 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.060
 I notice that it is going quite slow but good 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.400
 still so to get more fully and 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.220
 that do not affect pineapples and all that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.520
 Well, it goes pretty well but almost 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.580
 preferring the other to carry light weight and 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.580
 agile hands because he was carrying scavengers 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.190
 in this class or scavenger 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.680
 to be able to try what is nuclear and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.130
 that but I can not with the shotguns that 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.990
 I get too much all the time and what 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.940
 you have to do for the nuclear ones because it's 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.880
 try to hold them a little more than 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.670
 come out they do not do not get in there 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.360
 but good so playing like this 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.430
 They usually kill me a lot more but I do not 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.040
 I know how much better what happened 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.560
 going like this and if they kill me then 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.930
 kill me but get you go super low and 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.780
 things like that, I do not know almost what 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.870
 like what happens that is what 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.940
 better in this game I do not know if it ends 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.330
 107 ah 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.300
 to 50 they killed me 50 times is a burrada 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.000
 what killed me but I took out 22 chains 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.670
 of casualties of these 2 super casualties and one 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.010
 low turbo I think it was and nothing there 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.570
 I leave the medals and that and I hope that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.570
 have liked and until next time
