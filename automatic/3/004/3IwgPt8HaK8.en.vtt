00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
 now 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.670
 two 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.119
 friends of the rabbits note here that 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.950
 coolest family one of my races 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.810
 favorite angora rabbits 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.630
 what is an angora rabbit is basically 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 a rabbit like the rest but the hair is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 special as you see here they are super 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.630
 pompous have a very long hair 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.910
 They have very pointed ears and they 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.880
 I want to comment on the features 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 since they are tiny until they go 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.480
 growing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.370
 very well we start with the dwarf fix 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020
 how do we know what an angora is like 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.970
 we really do not know it basically 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.250
 we know it because we know it comes from 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.160
 parents who are but the hair in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.560
 this age is still short 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
 here we have a month and a half here 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.810
 We have already spent three and a half months already 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.020
 grown a lot look at the hair 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.930
 pompous silky the skeleton stretches and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.440
 you will say yes they look like rabbits 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.330
 big 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.100
 these bunnies the truth that when you 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.250
 he bathes them or when we wet their hair they 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.000
 they are in nothing are all hair are like 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.220
 stuffed animals and immediately after a year the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 we have so you say ya giant mother 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.150
 Mine, what a big rabbit, it's not 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.830
 Featherweight it weighs nothing is everything is 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.830
 all hair but the truth is that the hair is 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.740
 its great advantage but also its great 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.360
 I work because this hair gives us 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.190
 a lot of work we have to be 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.220
 practically daily brushing it and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.920
 untangling the knots that yes now well 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.980
 because we have a rabbit 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.870
 spectacular that draws attention very 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.990
 flat as I tell you with the ears very 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.470
 pointy and with a hair that really 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 it seems a cloud need to have a lot 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 heat care have to be in 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.010
 places prescribed because I know but it gives them 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 very hot and how well I told you before 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.900
 untangle all the knots in all 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 moment on the other hand very much 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.690
 hay and the diet should be or should be 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.960
 rich in proteins and weights range 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 between 150 grams more or less of the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.200
 Puppies that are already eating 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.599
 alone 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.349
 going through the 500 600 grams of 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.989
 puppies that have 34 months until the 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.750
 maximum that females reach with 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.410
 six months the males with seven months 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 which is one kilo 800 and although it seems 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.680
 much fatter as I say is all 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.680
 hair
