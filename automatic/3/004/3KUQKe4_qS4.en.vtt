00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.359
 elements or materials but it is a good time to investigate a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.970
 terrestrial phenomenon a natural phenomenon more records to I think I wanted more 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.640

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.470
 are these tunnels that take 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 after what happened in other areas of society 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.210
 this remains of a civilization that inhabited 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.330
 everything was 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.270

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.530
 I wanted to explain 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.030
 yes it was that it can well delegate the policeman who was totally the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.870
 called very interesting 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.470
 we did some analysts like the reality 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.220
 it shows that 14m 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 the moment is dimensioned 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.930
 a single room was also made and it was found 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 cadastral

 so that his people could see their work 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.620
 he took several photos and it is also very important that the witnesses send us 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.140
 the photographic sequence 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.520

 not everything you can ovni in all the cases we see are true 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 You have to know how to discriminate dissent 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.150
 and to be able to differentiate which can be real and which is not 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.070
