00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.370 
all the Titans in was it just the fact
that<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.150> yelled<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.900> came<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.290> because

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that she yelled and they came in because

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
that she yelled and they came in because
they<00:01:28.619> heard<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> noise<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they heard all the noise or was it the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
they heard all the noise or was it the
way<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> saucer<00:01:30.990> described<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> that's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
way that saucer described it that's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.649 
way that saucer described it that's
pretty<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.100> dying<00:01:32.579> call<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.479> just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
pretty much a dying call and it was just

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the thing about it is that she planned

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
the thing about it is that she planned
this<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> get-go<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.479> okay<00:02:00.810> yo<00:02:01.049> I'm

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
this from the get-go is like okay yo I'm

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.959 
this from the get-go is like okay yo I'm
captured<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:02.100> still<00:02:02.399> gonna<00:02:02.610> get<00:02:02.850> away

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
captured and I'm still gonna get away

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
captured and I'm still gonna get away
with<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.770> find

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
with this as well because then we find

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
with this as well because then we find
out<00:02:05.189> later<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> she<00:02:06.180> pretty<00:02:06.390> much<00:02:06.540> wasn't

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
out later that she pretty much wasn't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
out later that she pretty much wasn't
eaten<00:02:07.290> she<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:07.890> eat<00:02:08.039> her<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.399> as

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
eaten she just had them eat her and as

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.870 
eaten she just had them eat her and as
she<00:02:08.729> jumped<00:02:09.000> away<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> three

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
she jumped away on the three

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.700 
she jumped away on the three
Geir<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.570> now<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:10.900> safe<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.230> assume<00:02:11.260> it's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
Geir so now it's safe to assume it's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.410 
Geir so now it's safe to assume it's
definitely<00:02:12.220> somebody<00:02:12.580> within<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> group<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
definitely somebody within the group and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
definitely somebody within the group and
it<00:02:13.540> was<00:02:13.570> also<00:02:13.960> hinted<00:02:14.290> earlier<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it was also hinted earlier in the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
it was also hinted earlier in the
episode<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.610> paid<00:02:15.820> attention<00:02:15.850> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
episode if you paid attention that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
episode if you paid attention that
pretty<00:02:16.840> much<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.320> first<00:02:17.560> traders<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.520> stuff

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
pretty much the first traders and stuff

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.490 
pretty much the first traders and stuff
like<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.060> didn't<00:02:19.540> appear<00:02:19.870> until<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.290> said

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like that didn't appear until they said

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.260 
like that didn't appear until they said
about<00:02:20.680> five<00:02:20.980> years<00:02:21.160> ago<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.730> pretty<00:02:21.940> much<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
about five years ago so pretty much it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.640 
about five years ago so pretty much it
has<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.570> be<00:02:22.690> somebody<00:02:22.900> within<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.380> rookie

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
has to be somebody within the rookie

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.050 
has to be somebody within the rookie
group<00:02:23.860> right<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.430> makes<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.820> further

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
group right and that makes you further

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
group right and that makes you further
speculate<00:02:25.750> exactly<00:02:26.320> who<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.890> trader

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
speculate exactly who is this trader

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.670 
speculate exactly who is this trader
think<00:02:27.790> about<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.300> Levi<00:02:28.720> stood<00:02:29.050> behind<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.650> I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
think about it is Levi stood behind so I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.320 
think about it is Levi stood behind so I
think<00:02:29.800> there<00:02:30.160> might<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.550> class<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.150> her

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
think there might be a class with her

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.270 
think there might be a class with her
and<00:02:31.510> Levi<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.230> another<00:02:32.530> thing<00:02:32.710> we<00:02:32.860> also<00:02:33.040> get

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and Levi and another thing we also get

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.010 
and Levi and another thing we also get
to<00:02:33.310> learn<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.790> she<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.120> turn<00:02:34.300> her<00:02:34.510> hands

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
to learn that she can turn her hands

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.110 
to learn that she can turn her hands
different<00:02:35.530> parts<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.830> her<00:02:35.980> body<00:02:36.220> into<00:02:36.970> like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
different parts of her body into like

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120 
different parts of her body into like
hardened<00:02:37.720> parts<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.680> kind<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
hardened parts so it's kind of like the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.620 
hardened parts so it's kind of like the
armored<00:02:39.430> Titan<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.390> makes<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
armored Titan and that also makes you

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.660 
armored Titan and that also makes you
think<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.200> again<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> unique<00:02:41.980> ability<00:02:42.160> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
think is this again a unique ability of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.010 
think is this again a unique ability of
hers<00:02:42.850> because<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> armored

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
hers because we know that the armored

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
she just did it was almost like a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.710
