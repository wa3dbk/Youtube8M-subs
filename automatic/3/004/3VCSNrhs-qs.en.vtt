longer infected so I'm really happy

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.440 
longer infected so I'm really happy
about<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.100> um<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.119> thinking<00:01:18.330> about

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
about it but um if you're thinking about

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.330

like<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.080> pain<00:01:19.350> scale<00:01:19.939> if<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.869> typically<00:01:22.340> get

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
like the pain scale if you typically get

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.320 
like the pain scale if you typically get

think<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> worth<00:01:28.290> anything<00:01:29.060> however<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
think that it's worth anything however I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
think that it's worth anything however I
will<00:01:31.049> admit<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.250> triple<00:01:32.610> helix<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.119> my

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
will admit that the triple helix was my

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.859 
will admit that the triple helix was my
most<00:01:33.509> painful<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.950> sent<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.670> Brooke<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
most painful I had sent my Brooke that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
most painful I had sent my Brooke that
was<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.110> first<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.979> piercing<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:39.119> Oh

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
was my first like other piercing like Oh

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.050 
was my first like other piercing like Oh
than<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.509> ears<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:39.930> bellybutton<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.060> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
than my ears in my bellybutton and that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
than my ears in my bellybutton and that
surprisingly<00:01:42.780> didn't<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.290> hurt<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
surprisingly didn't really hurt and I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
surprisingly didn't really hurt and I
was<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.100> oh<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.549> great<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
was like oh this is great you know and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
was like oh this is great you know and
then<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.320> tragus<00:01:46.530> done<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> took

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
then I got my tragus done which I took

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
then I got my tragus done which I took
it<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.360> got<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.869> done<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.570> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it out because I got this done and and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
it out because I got this done and and
that<00:01:51.780> didn't<00:01:52.049> hurt<00:01:52.170> either

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that didn't hurt either

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.480 
that didn't hurt either
but<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.790> hurt<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.360> worst<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:55.490> um

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
but then this hurt the worst because um

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.330 
but then this hurt the worst because um
I<00:01:56.750> think<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.189> one

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I think because like it's three at one

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
I think because like it's three at one
time<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> first<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:01.110> did<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
time so the first one they did the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.539 
time so the first one they did the
bottom<00:02:01.590> first<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.009> oh<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.369> isn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
bottom first I was like oh this isn't

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.300 
bottom first I was like oh this isn't
bad<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.990> came<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> then

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
bad but then this one came and and then

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
bad but then this one came and and then

with antibacterial soap too whatever no

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.720 
with antibacterial soap too whatever no
it's<00:02:24.480> probably<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.960> best<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.340> mean<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
it's probably not the best but I mean so

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's probably not the best but I mean so
far<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.390> had<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> little<00:02:28.530> keloid<00:02:29.070> on<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> them

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
far I had a little keloid on one of them

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.630 
far I had a little keloid on one of them
it<00:02:30.720> was<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> middle<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.890> seems<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.520> be

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
it was the middle one but it seems to be

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.850 
it was the middle one but it seems to be
going<00:02:32.790> away<00:02:33.210> just<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.200> its<00:02:34.350> own<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.770> I'm

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
going away just like on its own so I'm

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.370 
going away just like on its own so I'm
really<00:02:34.980> happy<00:02:35.160> about<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.880> um<00:02:36.380> basically

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
really happy about it but um basically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.200 
really happy about it but um basically
moral<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> story<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:40.460> it's<00:02:41.460> worth<00:02:41.640> it

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
moral of the story is that it's worth it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.580 
moral of the story is that it's worth it
if<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:42.990> worth<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
if you think it's worth it and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.430 
if you think it's worth it and
definitely<00:02:44.340> make<00:02:44.970> sure<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.660> who<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.290> go
