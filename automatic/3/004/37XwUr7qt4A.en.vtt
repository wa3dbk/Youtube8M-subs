00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 Hello everyone and eat before 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.810
 people today 21 has left another new 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 message of the day in whites 2 in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.240
 multiplayer and it's like that says listen the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.610
 sound of my voice this who says it then 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.230
 This is what Dr. Salim says as 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.330
 we have seen in the teasers the doctor 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.470
 Salim is the one who is dedicated to doing 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.390
 experiments with those test subjects 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.130
 that we do not know who they are but that 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.220
 will be important for the history of 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.760
 call of duty not so much campaign mode 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.370
 like the zombie mode but notice 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.380
 one thing they have put here in the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.140
 message of the day just as they put the 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.520
 of the tree, now a post is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.739
 image that we are seeing here that is of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.050
 a brain an x-ray a kind 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.960
 of x - ray in a brain what do you want 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.260
 say this because this is already seen 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.200
 clearly not only give you clues in 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.590
 the campaign and what zombie mode 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 it's the story not and its relationship but 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 multiplayer are also going to be 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.750
 putting clues have already been putting 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 pizzas previously 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 we have removed 20 thousand things from 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.040
 the maps of the old maps of both 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.470
 of white is one like black ops 2 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.100
 for example the study by say 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 one but I'm already seeing that this 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.380
 they were not not nonsense but it was 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.720
 a reality now because they are already 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.940
 putting in the message of the day by 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.650
 example and here you are seeing 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.380
 the doctor's words about what 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.120
 hear the sound of my voice because that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.240
 Kiss and why is the brain because 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.220
 he is seeing what he is 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.400
 pretending with those people with those 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.230
 test subjects is trying as 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.050
 hypnotize them how to try them 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.800
 do what he wants to do what he does 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.510
 he says he's getting into me 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.620
 introducing those words into the 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.110
 memory in the mind but what will happen more 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.790
 go ahead with them that happened already 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.780
 we know that almost all have died 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.180
 only three remain and one died on 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.970
 last one endured a little more for the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.520
 injections that were getting him 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.980
 apparently but good until we have 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.920
 come safely they will continue to take out 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.510
 teasers until Sunday arrives 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.330
 minimal because these are capable of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.980
 continue like this until the black ops comes out 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.010
 3 in November but good at least 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.439
 until the trailer comes out 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 on Sunday we will surely be with 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.930
 masters are you watching and in that photograph 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.900
 or on that radiograph you see a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.780
 pad and a number 12 but of course if 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.690
 we look it upside down I would put 21 that is the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.299
 today is not today is day 21 then no 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.610
 I know what you mean by that I do not have 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.110
 idea I'm not going to get popular or phil 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.239
 nonsense but good if someone has 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.970
 some idea of ​​what you can do or 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.690
 You can give your opinion because 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.630
 you know my friends 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.670
 the last thing if you think that everything has 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.590
 relationship both the history of the campaign 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.440
 as in multiplayer because they give us 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.130
 clues like the story of zombies 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.320
 all that in one give the ex and how 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.320
 I always say until the next video
