00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
on there and the monsters University

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.700 
on there and the monsters University
logo<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.250> rear<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.710> magnetized

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.149 
logo to the rear this is a magnetized
mats<00:01:37.040> because<00:01:37.479> underneath<00:01:38.479> George<00:01:39.049> we<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
mats because underneath George we have a

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.210 
mats because underneath George we have a
magnet<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:40.909> does<00:01:41.180> trigger<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.680> figure<00:01:43.040> so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
magnet which does trigger the figure so

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.010 
magnet which does trigger the figure so
as<00:01:43.340> soon<00:01:43.549> as<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> drop<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.180> George<00:01:44.540> on<00:01:44.840> that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
as soon as you drop the George on that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.170 
as soon as you drop the George on that
mat<00:01:45.229> he<00:01:45.860> will<00:01:46.070> spring<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.790> as<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:47.119> see

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
mat he will spring up and as you can see

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.780 
mat he will spring up and as you can see
the<00:01:48.110> masses<00:01:48.650> stop<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.130> him<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.460> will<00:01:49.640> need

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
the masses stop to him so you will need

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.960 
the masses stop to him so you will need
to<00:01:49.909> pull<00:01:50.180> him<00:01:50.689> off<00:01:50.990> because<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
to pull him off because there is the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.390 
to pull him off because there is the
magnetic<00:01:53.600> force<00:01:54.229> holding<00:01:54.770> him<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.220> there

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
magnetic force holding him on there

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.999 
magnetic force holding him on there
let's<00:01:55.580> take<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> quick<00:01:56.330> look<00:01:56.680> George<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.799> very

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
wacky looking goofy expression to George

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.340 
wacky looking goofy expression to George
and<00:02:00.729> some<00:02:01.729> nasty<00:02:01.880> fell<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.840> body<00:02:03.020> as<00:02:03.170> well

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and some nasty fell to the body as well

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.310
