measurements Nick's head up to the bell

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
measurements Nick's head up to the bell
metering<00:00:48.960> time<00:00:49.200> how<00:00:49.410> long<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> takes<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
metering time how long it takes for the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.000 
metering time how long it takes for the
disk<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> analog<00:00:51.750> meter<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.649> make<00:00:52.770> one

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
disk from the analog meter to make one

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.440 
disk from the analog meter to make one
full<00:00:53.219> revolution

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
full revolution

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.020

so<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> meter<00:00:56.130> with<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so here you can see the meter with a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.470 
so here you can see the meter with a
close-up<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.110> see<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.380> revolting<00:00:58.770> disk

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
close-up you can see the revolting disk

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.730 
close-up you can see the revolting disk
take<00:01:00.480> note<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.900> numbers<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.290> come<00:01:01.590> up

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
take note of the numbers that come up

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.460 
take note of the numbers that come up
well<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.130> KH<00:01:02.700> here<00:01:03.300> mine<00:01:03.540> similar<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.140> yours

revolution or disk so for me would be
3600<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.580> for<00:01:50.729> 7.2<00:01:51.240> engage<00:01:51.899> them<00:01:52.250> /<00:01:53.250> 85

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
3600 time for 7.2 engage them / 85

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.750 
3600 time for 7.2 engage them / 85
seconds

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.580 

so<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.660> see<00:01:57.900> where<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> numbers

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so here you can see where the numbers

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
so here you can see where the numbers
for<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.770> first<00:01:59.040> time<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.640> blood<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.510> green

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
for my first time and blood and green

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.720 
for my first time and blood and green
the<00:02:01.500> numbers<00:02:01.800> for<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.010> second<00:02:02.370> timing<00:02:02.520> with

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
the numbers for my second timing with

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.910 
the numbers for my second timing with
the<00:02:02.820> computers<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.360> stop<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.500> goes<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the computers will stop this goes to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.650 
the computers will stop this goes to
power<00:02:05.130> measurements<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:05.880> enough<00:02:06.540> i

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
power measurements and what enough i

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.109 
power measurements and what enough i
subtract<00:02:07.080> first<00:02:07.440> from<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.650> second<00:02:08.040> I'm<00:02:08.880> left

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
subtract first from the second I'm left

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.810 
subtract first from the second I'm left
with<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.630> 113<00:02:10.470> watts<00:02:10.710> which<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> what

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
with just over 113 watts which is what

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.610 
with just over 113 watts which is what
my<00:02:11.940> computer<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.420> using<00:02:12.780> an<00:02:12.900> entitled<00:02:13.380> state

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
my computer is using an entitled state

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
my computer is using an entitled state
once<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> simple<00:02:15.270> matter<00:02:15.300> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
once you have this is a simple matter of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.240 
once you have this is a simple matter of
finding<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> unit<00:02:16.500> charges<00:02:16.920> for

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
finding out what the unit charges for

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.790 
finding out what the unit charges for
electricity<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.320> work<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.680> how

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
electricity you can then work out how

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.460 
electricity you can then work out how
much<00:02:19.860> your<00:02:20.070> computer's<00:02:20.520> costing<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.970> Tara

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
much your computer's costing you Tara

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.720 
much your computer's costing you Tara
everything<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.560> expensive<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.400> might<00:02:23.550> want

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
everything is expensive you might want

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.360 
everything is expensive you might want
to<00:02:23.790> consider<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.240> more
