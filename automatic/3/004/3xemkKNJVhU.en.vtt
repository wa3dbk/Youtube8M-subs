00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.930
 the third today I will show and tell you how 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.349
 a synthesis of such a beautiful dress with sleeves 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.349
 such 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.220
 she can wear it in two ways i 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 first show how the first they are done 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.410
 made from small to just there you can 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:41.800
 wearing different is very easy 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:47.769
 we need him for a piece to them i 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:52.290
 I'll show you how to measure also on balance 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:55.000
 measuring tape or ruler scissors 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.330
 also need some kind of clip 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.350
 I took such a daisy and on balance 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.570
 You can take a piece of jewelry here 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:10.570
 such a chain can take here such 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 pieces shimmer beautifully and sew 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.320
 can then 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:20.799
 and here are such stickers to be 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.840
 unstuck off predna dress and so myself 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.579
 I wonder what to pay as I wrote 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.740
 above the video it is not necessary to paint is not necessary 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:35.710
 sew everything because it is done in total 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.380
 only from one piece of cloth with a hole 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.100
 namely how and where do I now 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 I tell because it's here on the distance 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.030
 hole is the distance that will be 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 allowance 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.160
 that is, well, so it would delay and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.220
 Tatarstan here and it is possible to do more 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.830
 also here these as you already understood in 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:10.790
 merging it will be sleeves changed oh 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:15.350
 one sleeve will be 5 centimeters but so 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.570
 Mother goes a little on his shoulder therefore 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.700
 always as if done on 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.830
 half that is my hand will be 2 and 5 7 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.210
 5 centimeters from this side also 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.060
 according to this member I have 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.360
 is two and a half three 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.540
 centimeter but this is how you get it 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.370
 the length of the dress itself 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 here is gibson from meters but it is only after 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.720
 holes 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.380
 here we have meters right from here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.620
 measure and here I will have of course 9 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.950
 centimeters and so do the hole 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.340
 she must be a big hole 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 small as if for example I have it 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.970
 is five and a half can 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.850
 do 60 meters but no more because 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.620
 what then will be ugly just 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.940
 knit years old people know me so 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.780
 happened by chance 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.840
 and then I'll show you how to put it on. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.840
 the dress 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.769
 and so i will have you shown this 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.239
 sample 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.069
 you can do on any fabric 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.590
 absolutely any pattern color to you what are they 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.400
 prayed if the matrix can be like this 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.470
 over the chest and under the shitzu and so how 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.000
 The first option to do now is show you 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.409
 put on so we first put on like this 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.129
 our hands so now we straighten and 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:04:01.109
 Bow of the person in standing around 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:04:03.030
 we turn over hands down and a butterfly 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:10.819
 we fix the butterfly 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:15.930
 daisy 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.690
 we have formed about such yes and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 and such we omit his goal now 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:27.050
 And these here we hide on 20 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.380
 so therefore it is necessary to do this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.260
 part a little longer than that's how I 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.419
 how much did she forget 23 centimeters so 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.440
 because I was sitting with a short those things 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.930
 just to the bottom of the case does not fit 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.330
 that's how it turned out now we can 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.720
 tie a belt 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:00.389
 either decide here is such a beautiful 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:04.830
 Dusty Belt Yes, you can attach a sticker 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.940
 like this for example in different ways 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.940
 can I smoke 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:17.069
 now I will show you how to make a second 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:21.759
 version of the dress so I already have another doll 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:29.009
 here on this so here we raise the handles 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:29.009
 and we put these hands on like this 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:40.870
 write leveling for Carla vi 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:44.319
 turn this way from friend to 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.759
 friend impose these here Circuits here 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:52.590
 something beautifully formed here 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.590
 do so that nothing is visible and 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.139
 again 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:06.090
 Could not exactly 1 what 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:06.090
 and stab here 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.070
 as you can see, and the front looks like this 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:20.490
 very nice here, too, but this dress 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.979
 such more lush can be done 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.669
 fitting can be absolutely sure not to make 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:33.449
 attack and of course attach to 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:35.430
 him some pieces and stickers for example 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.930
 to finish the butterfly is not beautiful 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.240
 butterfly what 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.590
 chamomile eat pig clip small then 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.240
 can you have such a story 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.479
 sew a belt on them or you can 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:57.470
 just hearts like me here in this dress 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:07:05.389
 more precisely as immediately in this way and 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:05.389
 once again on the side so here 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.290
 So 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.820
 that's the way we did it 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.810
 get a dress that can be worn 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:22.430
 differently two kinds well if you 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:25.130
 can you think of a viewer no I 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.240
 just another inventing maybe you 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.400
 think you could still wear here 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.590
 It turned out so beautifully on the axis site 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.590
 thanks everyone for watching goodbye
