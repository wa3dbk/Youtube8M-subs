drop shouted myself so nice little move

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.699 
drop shouted myself so nice little move
by<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.670> guy<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:16.090> need<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.450> learn<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:16.660> one<00:04:17.080> but

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
by that guy I need to learn that one but

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.630 
by that guy I need to learn that one but
that's<00:04:17.890> something<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.250> can't<00:04:18.459> do<00:04:18.609> a

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
that's something you can't do a

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.090 
that's something you can't do a
battlefield<00:04:18.970> board<00:04:19.390> play<00:04:19.600> inside<00:04:19.870> too

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
battlefield board play inside too

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.150 
battlefield board play inside too
because<00:04:21.100> your<00:04:21.220> co2<00:04:21.400> fire<00:04:21.700> goes<00:04:22.330> Ashley

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
because your co2 fire goes Ashley

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.910 
because your co2 fire goes Ashley
stick<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:23.850> not<00:04:24.600> accurate<00:04:24.920> whatsoever

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
stick and it's not accurate whatsoever

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.630 
stick and it's not accurate whatsoever
so<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:27.210> don't<00:04:27.420> want<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.720> pick<00:04:28.080> up<00:04:28.110> that

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
so I really don't want to pick up that

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.150 
so I really don't want to pick up that
tactic<00:04:29.640> as<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.150> concussed<00:04:30.900> myself<00:04:31.410> like<00:04:32.130> a

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
tactic as I just concussed myself like a

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.720 
tactic as I just concussed myself like a
