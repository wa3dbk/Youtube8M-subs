00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
to the format tab recolor

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.059 
to the format tab recolor
set<00:02:11.310> transparent<00:02:11.940> color<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.709> get<00:02:13.920> this

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
set transparent color and you get this

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.260 
set transparent color and you get this
nice<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.459> point<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.270> thing<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.630> do

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
nice little point of thing and do

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.300 
nice little point of thing and do
you<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.780> remove<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.350> background<00:02:17.560> color<00:02:18.010> and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
you can remove the background color and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.540 
you can remove the background color and
the<00:02:19.210> reason<00:02:19.510> why<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.050> told<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.920> before<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.310> it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
the reason why I told you before that it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.250 
the reason why I told you before that it
needs<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.820> be<00:02:21.970> white<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
needs to be white is because if the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.490 
needs to be white is because if the
dragon<00:02:23.650> fruit<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.950> too<00:02:24.220> white<00:02:24.460> or<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:26.020> image

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
dragon fruit is too white or the image

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.410 
dragon fruit is too white or the image
is<00:02:26.710> too<00:02:27.160> white<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.700> subject<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.210> want<00:02:28.300> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
is too white or the subject you want to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.840 
is too white or the subject you want to
isolate<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.960> too<00:02:29.170> white<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.950> will<00:02:30.280> take<00:02:30.610> away

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
isolate is too white it will take away

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.780 
isolate is too white it will take away
that<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.690> click<00:02:32.290> anywhere<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.860> there

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that also so click anywhere and there

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.820 
that also so click anywhere and there
you<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.630> instantly<00:02:35.140> taken<00:02:35.620> away

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you can see it is instantly taken away

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can see it is instantly taken away
the<00:02:36.130> wise<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:37.780> change<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.830> any

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the wise you can then change to any

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.090 
the wise you can then change to any
color<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:39.670> should<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.840> fine<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.620> is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
color and it should be fine it is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.370 
color and it should be fine it is
obviously<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.270> best<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.960> can<00:02:44.170> see

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
obviously not the best you can see

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.400 
obviously not the best you can see
little<00:02:44.590> bits<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:45.130> extra<00:02:46.060> stuff<00:02:46.720> there<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.230> you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
little bits of extra stuff there but you

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
little bits of extra stuff there but you
can<00:02:47.590> easily<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:48.190> go<00:02:48.580> into<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.880> format<00:02:49.180> tab

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
can easily just go into the format tab

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.560 
can easily just go into the format tab
picture<00:02:50.320> effects<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.890> soften<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.580> edges<00:02:51.820> by

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
picture effects and soften the edges by

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.900 
picture effects and soften the edges by
just<00:02:52.990> one<00:02:53.260> point<00:02:53.620> or<00:02:53.800> two<00:02:54.010> points<00:02:54.370> just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
just one point or two points just

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.500 
just one point or two points just
slightly<00:02:55.210> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:57.190> change<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.120> background

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
slightly and then change the background

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.070 
slightly and then change the background
back<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.960> white<00:03:00.270> now<00:03:01.270> you've<00:03:01.420> got<00:03:01.570> your<00:03:01.690> dragon

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
back to white now you've got your dragon

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.110 
back to white now you've got your dragon
fruit<00:03:02.380> now<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.100> need<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.640> create<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
fruit now you need to create the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.180 
fruit now you need to create the
reflection<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.470> need<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.830> copy

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
reflection and for that you need to copy

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.980 
reflection and for that you need to copy
and<00:03:06.430> paste<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.820> dragon<00:03:07.150> fruit<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:09.750> paste<00:03:10.750> it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
and paste the dragon fruit and paste it

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.670 
and paste the dragon fruit and paste it
yep

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
yep

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.170 
yep
and<00:03:13.080> with<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.230> second<00:03:14.590> dragon<00:03:14.740> fruit<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:16.060> can

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and with the second dragon fruit you can

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.930 
and with the second dragon fruit you can
rotate<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.080> flip<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.770> vertically<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.220> now

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
rotate it and flip it vertically and now

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.250 
rotate it and flip it vertically and now
I'm<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.480> say<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.900> right<00:03:23.080> now

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
I'm just going to say this right now

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.500 
I'm just going to say this right now
that<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> reason<00:03:23.950> why<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.130> don't<00:03:24.400> use<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
that the reason why I don't use the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.760 
that the reason why I don't use the
reflections<00:03:26.080> which<00:03:26.230> are<00:03:26.380> built<00:03:26.590> into

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
reflections which are built into

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.520 
reflections which are built into
PowerPoint<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.730> because<00:03:28.090> they<00:03:28.930> sort<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.320> end

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
PowerPoint is because they sort of end

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.890 
PowerPoint is because they sort of end
up<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> weirdest<00:03:30.730> positions<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.540> if<00:03:31.780> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
up in the weirdest positions and if you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.610 
up in the weirdest positions and if you
look<00:03:32.050> carefully<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.940> almost<00:03:33.940> looks<00:03:34.330> as<00:03:34.600> if<00:03:35.050> the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
look carefully it almost looks as if the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740 
look carefully it almost looks as if the
dragon<00:03:36.070> fruit<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.459> floating<00:03:37.000> or<00:03:37.240> it's<00:03:37.390> too

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
dragon fruit is floating or it's too

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.500 
dragon fruit is floating or it's too
high<00:03:38.020> or<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:38.560> it's<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.520> in<00:03:39.670> midair<00:03:40.330> or

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
high or if it's that it's in midair or

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.060 
high or if it's that it's in midair or
something<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.709> doesn't<00:03:41.860> look<00:03:41.980> right

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
something and it just doesn't look right

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.280 
something and it just doesn't look right
so<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.670> like<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:42.970> create<00:03:43.480> my<00:03:43.660> own<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.050> I<00:03:44.080> have

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
so I like to create my own so I have

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.900 
so I like to create my own so I have
more<00:03:44.470> flexibility<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.310> control<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:47.910> once

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
more flexibility and control so once

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.550 
more flexibility and control so once
you've<00:03:49.060> flipped<00:03:49.300> your<00:03:49.420> image<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.260> flip

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you've flipped your image in the flip

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.140 
you've flipped your image in the flip
rotate<00:03:51.000> pane<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.959> have<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.670> create<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> square

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
rotate pane you have to create a square

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.810 
rotate pane you have to create a square
over<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.320> going<00:03:56.530> insert<00:03:57.070> shapes<00:03:57.520> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
over that so going insert shapes and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.040 
over that so going insert shapes and
drag<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.600> rectangle<00:03:58.780> over<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.860> shape<00:04:01.050> now

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
drag a rectangle over that shape now

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.130 
drag a rectangle over that shape now
you've<00:04:02.200> got<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.380> rectangle<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.700> can<00:04:03.940> now<00:04:04.209> click

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
you've got a rectangle you can now click

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.870 
you've got a rectangle you can now click
on<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.380> top<00:04:05.620> dragon<00:04:05.890> fruit<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.280> bring<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.760> in

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
on the top dragon fruit and bring it in

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.630 
on the top dragon fruit and bring it in
front<00:04:07.470> now<00:04:08.470> with<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.740> Blue<00:04:09.070> Square<00:04:09.100> we're

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
front now with this Blue Square we're

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.040 
front now with this Blue Square we're
going<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.850> turn<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.120> into<00:04:10.240> a<00:04:10.330> white<00:04:10.630> square<00:04:10.990> and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
going to turn it into a white square and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.260 
going to turn it into a white square and
slowly<00:04:11.620> bring<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.010> transparency<00:04:12.670> down<00:04:12.820> until

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
slowly bring the transparency down until

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.790 
slowly bring the transparency down until
you<00:04:13.420> see<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.660> reflection<00:04:13.870> sort<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.620> come

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
you see a reflection sort of come

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.680 
you see a reflection sort of come
through<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:16.060> right<00:04:16.600> click<00:04:16.750> format<00:04:17.470> shape<00:04:17.799> and

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
through so right click format shape and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.810 
through so right click format shape and
take<00:04:19.690> away<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.930> line<00:04:20.200> then<00:04:21.190> go<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.400> gradient

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
take away the line then go to gradient

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.540 
take away the line then go to gradient
fill<00:04:22.290> now<00:04:23.290> I've<00:04:23.500> got<00:04:23.680> this<00:04:23.770> default<00:04:24.280> gradient

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
fill now I've got this default gradient

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.100 
fill now I've got this default gradient
which<00:04:24.880> will<00:04:25.150> always<00:04:25.330> happen<00:04:25.600> if<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.900> click

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
which will always happen if you click

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.320 
which will always happen if you click
gradients<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:27.610> want<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.940> remove<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
gradients and I want to remove the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.700 
gradients and I want to remove the
second<00:04:28.750> point<00:04:28.930> stop

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
second point stop

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.860 
second point stop
remove<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:32.130> click<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.390> change<00:04:34.390> brush<00:04:34.690> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
colors to a white stop one and stop two

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.030 
colors to a white stop one and stop two
should<00:04:39.910> both<00:04:40.060> be<00:04:40.090> white<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:40.600> now<00:04:41.140> if<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.590> click

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
should both be white and now if I click

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.700 
should both be white and now if I click
on<00:04:42.130> stop<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:42.910> bring<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.990> transparency

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
on stop one and bring the transparency

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.400 
on stop one and bring the transparency
up<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:46.060> can<00:04:46.240> see<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.780> dragonfruit

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
up you can see that a dragonfruit

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.620 
up you can see that a dragonfruit
reflection<00:04:48.070> is<00:04:48.220> slowly<00:04:48.550> coming<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.300> through

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
reflection is slowly coming in through

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.610 
reflection is slowly coming in through
and<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.370> put<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.610> at<00:04:51.760> about<00:04:51.940> 50%<00:04:52.620> now

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
and I like to put this at about 50% now

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.310 
and I like to put this at about 50% now
you<00:04:53.680> can<00:04:53.950> find<00:04:54.430> units<00:04:54.940> you<00:04:55.330> can<00:04:55.360> fix<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.900> up<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
you can find units you can fix it up the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.600 
you can find units you can fix it up the
way<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> want<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.890> can<00:04:57.040> move<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.280> top<00:04:57.460> one

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
way you want you can move the top one

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.280 
way you want you can move the top one
down<00:04:57.730> do<00:04:58.270> whatever<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.720> make<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:58.990> look<00:04:59.110> more

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
down do whatever to make it look more

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.460 
down do whatever to make it look more
realistic<00:05:00.390> now<00:05:01.390> that<00:05:01.630> looks<00:05:01.810> about<00:05:01.930> right<00:05:02.230> I'm

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
realistic now that looks about right I'm

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.520 
realistic now that looks about right I'm
going<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.100> quickly<00:05:03.370> do<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.640> shadow<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.840> insert<00:05:05.500> a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
going to quickly do a shadow so insert a

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.510 
going to quickly do a shadow so insert a
shape<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.130> insert<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.360> circle<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:07.990> oval<00:05:08.590> now

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
shape and insert a circle and oval now

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.610 
shape and insert a circle and oval now
drag<00:05:09.880> over<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.450> area<00:05:10.480> of<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.050> dragon<00:05:11.410> fruit

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
drag over the area of the dragon fruit

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.330 
drag over the area of the dragon fruit
and<00:05:12.210> copy<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.420> twice<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.650> two<00:05:14.920> dragon

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
and copy it twice so you have two dragon

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.230 
and copy it twice so you have two dragon
fruits<00:05:15.810> shadows<00:05:16.810> now<00:05:17.770> select<00:05:18.730> both<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:19.030> them

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
fruits shadows now select both of them

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.740 
fruits shadows now select both of them
shift<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:20.190> format<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.280> objects<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.910> turn<00:05:22.570> it

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
shift and format the objects and turn it

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.840 
shift and format the objects and turn it
both<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.230> black<00:05:24.180> then<00:05:25.180> remove<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.780> line<00:05:25.960> and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
both to black then remove the line and

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.430 
both to black then remove the line and
you<00:05:27.850> sort<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.450> set<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.690> up<00:05:28.870> you're<00:05:29.170> halfway

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
you sort of set it up you're halfway

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.620 
you sort of set it up you're halfway
there<00:05:29.590> now<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.820> go<00:05:30.970> format<00:05:31.420> and

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
there now you have to go format and

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.990 
there now you have to go format and
shape<00:05:32.110> effects<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.740> use<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:33.100> soft<00:05:33.370> edges<00:05:33.610> but

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
shape effects and use the soft edges but

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.210 
shape effects and use the soft edges but
this<00:05:34.180> time<00:05:34.390> instead<00:05:34.600> of<00:05:34.690> one<00:05:34.930> or<00:05:34.960> two<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:36.040> make

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
this time instead of one or two you make

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.850 
this time instead of one or two you make
it<00:05:36.400> 50<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:37.420> until<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.840> gets<00:05:38.200> a<00:05:38.290> really<00:05:38.620> soft

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
it 50 so until it gets a really soft

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.270 
it 50 so until it gets a really soft
feel<00:05:39.160> to<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.540> then<00:05:40.540> you<00:05:40.930> can<00:05:41.100> scale<00:05:42.100> it<00:05:42.130> down

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
feel to it then you can scale it down

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.080 
feel to it then you can scale it down
and<00:05:42.840> format<00:05:43.840> objects<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:44.970> bring<00:05:45.970> the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
and format objects and bring the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.820 
and format objects and bring the
transparency<00:05:46.720> down<00:05:49.110> then<00:05:50.110> as<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.470> slowly

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
transparency down then as you slowly

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.010 
transparency down then as you slowly
bring<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.250> transparency<00:05:51.910> upwards<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.870> can

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
bring the transparency upwards you can

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.130 
bring the transparency upwards you can
slowly<00:05:53.290> see<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.920> shadow<00:05:54.160> is<00:05:55.140> slowly

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
slowly see that the shadow is slowly

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.920 
slowly see that the shadow is slowly
appearing<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.010> then<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:57.910> can<00:05:58.090> pick<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.750> top

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
appearing and then you can pick the top

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.880 
appearing and then you can pick the top
dragon<00:05:59.200> fruit<00:05:59.500> and<00:05:59.730> bring<00:06:00.730> it<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.150> front

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
dragon fruit and bring it to the front

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.020 
dragon fruit and bring it to the front
there<00:06:02.890> you<00:06:02.920> can<00:06:03.250> see<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.430> there's<00:06:03.730> a<00:06:03.790> shutter

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
there you can see that there's a shutter

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.110 
there you can see that there's a shutter
and<00:06:04.330> then<00:06:04.450> you<00:06:04.570> can<00:06:04.780> move<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.530> shadow<00:06:05.770> around

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
and then you can move the shadow around

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.810 
and then you can move the shadow around
change<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.300> shape<00:06:07.540> of<00:06:07.690> it<00:06:07.810> until<00:06:08.170> it<00:06:08.410> looks

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
change the shape of it until it looks

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.790 
change the shape of it until it looks
realistic<00:06:09.820> until<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:10.600> looks<00:06:10.780> proper<00:06:12.000> and

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
realistic until it looks proper and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.750 
realistic until it looks proper and
that's<00:06:14.820> pretty<00:06:15.820> good<00:06:17.100> that's<00:06:18.100> pretty<00:06:18.280> much<00:06:18.610> it

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
that's pretty good that's pretty much it

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.400 
that's pretty good that's pretty much it
