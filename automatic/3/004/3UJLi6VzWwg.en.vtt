00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 very good other kids that just like 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.639
 you are welcome to a new and others 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.650
 departure from the fraser river we are here in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 loreto one more day to tell you about 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 good things first of all 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.170
 tell you that what you have in the background is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 a game with morgan to which I have 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 removed right now the truth that is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 Pretty pretty, what frame is there 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 so many I give an advantage to me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.410
 team so that we can win the game 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 cast 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 but that's not the issue I also had to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 comment yes but we have a little 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 rare ingo fact is because I have a few 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 same cars that you flip in I look like a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 Smurf talking but well that's the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 topic but to comment on the subject of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 start in 2014 the new season and already 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 you know that the club started and if not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 You know then you know because I finish it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 to say they made it on the 17th of 1 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 of 2014 on the meeting page puts 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 that the realization of day 16 but not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.149
 because they restarted it at 2 o'clock 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.860
 tomorrow with which it was already day 17 that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.920
 it's more rivers of motherfuckers but good 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.770
 they made it the day of the day 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.270
 but good those who ask what is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.860
 what you have to do to plant in a 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.690
 new league so good they have put some 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.400
 ten matching matches that 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.320
 according to which you win are those that you lose and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.970
 also depending on your mmr you had 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.760
 currently in the hidden will get you into 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.620
 a division the league or what is 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.240
 I would call a post that will be 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.160
 tone and mayer of those that you win and those that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 lose one thing that has marked enough 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.180
 riot is the issue of lmr what is having 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.380
 quite into account in this season and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.290
 is that for example you win three 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.170
 table games you have artist first 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.360
 games and you want 45 and they put you put 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.860
 Silver to the gentlemen when you're in 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.020
 silver you start to lose to lose 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.759
 lose and suddenly you put on silver 5 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.830
 but as in the previous season of 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.360
 You could not go down there because people 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.910
 it was in silver but in reality it surpasses me 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 ere is what is put of block 32 of 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.140
 zinc bronze or whatever then 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.820
 Well, that means changing it and the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.580
 change not so in this season if you 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.430
 you go up to silver 1 worth but sorry 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.440
 you go up to silver 5 you will have a time of 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.000
 inevitability although do not say that 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.190
 basically you will not be able to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.020
 even if you lose you have zero points and 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.150
 you begin to lose you will not be able to lower 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 because you will have then that time but 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.020
 when that time has passed if you continue 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.370
 losing yes you can lose league 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.530
 perfectly silver 5 to the previous league 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.430
 in division 1 it is worth the living areas 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.100
 in silver 5 Apr 11 1 this the truth that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.780
 it's me I like not because I was not 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.580
 that technique people who love each other but for 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.870
 be in silver or gold because they have 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.970
 I had a bit of luck and it went up 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.680
 but afterwards can not go down I do not know 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.520
 if that's pretty good and this too 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.100
 influences 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.670
 Andrew and I had in season 3 you were 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.380
 in gold 5 and 9 it was very low for me now 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.440
 they will put you into what you really 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.140
 corresponds to your mmr is also worth the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.670
 river has remarked enough the subject of two 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.010
 points the few points that gave you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.690
 when maybe it was warm 1 and you 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 it cost a lot to go up to the next 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 division because the next division to 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.840
 the next league whatever it cost you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.450
 a lot because they gave you very few points 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.100
 because these rivers has changed now you go 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.750
 to win by the normal points or a 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.760
 little less anything but you're not going to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.190
 to win that one that point we lacked a 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.500
 point two points and it was practically 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880
 impossible to climb because when I lost 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.459
 there were many more of those 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.290
 they won by games then this says 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.710
 that they have changed it and also what 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.920
 says the one that yes they have left is in 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.050
 in the diamond division one there yes 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.270
 that have left this little lack 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.040
 since the players who want to climb 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.260
 aspirants want them to be players 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.150
 that really have been worked on and are 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.530
 very good then they say that in 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.320
 diamond one yes they're going to leave these 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.060
 few points remain then when this 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.440
 be division one of a league and good 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.000
 this has been all the truth that neither 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.980
 there was much more comment on the subject 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.900
 of the start and that yes that could have 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.220
 commented on some of the patch they put 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.020
 a couple of days devoted to 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.790
 champions and such but good since he has 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.590
 climbed quite a lot of people and over 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.630
 so go a couple of days in many 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.980
 of you already know what it brings 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.240
 I have decided not to comment also the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.490
 video if I had become very white 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.930
 but good to tell all of you the 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.330
 that you want to play with me on it does not read 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.370
 that the truth surprises me since not 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.230
 we are many people in this channel 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.870
 and I'm surprised that many of you 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.940
 so you want to play with you not then 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.520
