00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
level I think it's okay but I just think

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.910 
level I think it's okay but I just think
it's<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.910> part<00:02:37.210> of<00:02:37.500> everyone<00:02:38.500> involved

it's on the part of everyone involved
the<00:02:39.220> men<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.060> women<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.900> Booker's<00:02:41.290> to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
the men the women and the Booker's to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.640 
the men the women and the Booker's to
keep<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:43.540> keep<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.840> pretty<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.350> prevent<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
keep it to keep it pretty to prevent it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.380

think<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.180> could<00:02:49.300> keep<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> confines

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
think you could keep it in the confines

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
think you could keep it in the confines
and<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.500> wrestling<00:02:50.830> match<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.580> resort

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
to the excessive violence that could

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.350 
to the excessive violence that could
resonate<00:02:55.810> with<00:02:56.110> people<00:02:56.770> who<00:02:56.980> are<00:02:57.360> against
