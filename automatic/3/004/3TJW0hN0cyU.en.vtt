00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
let's say we try to take it a little

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
let's say we try to take it a little
quicker<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.280> she<00:01:41.729> tries<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.570> 20

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
quicker and that she tries to go for 20

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
quicker and that she tries to go for 20
seconds<00:01:43.380> -<00:01:43.649> badass<00:01:43.860> style<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.970> let's<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:45.299> she

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
seconds - badass style so let's say she

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.350 
seconds - badass style so let's say she
goes<00:01:45.600> 20<00:01:46.079> seconds<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:48.090> she

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
goes 20 seconds all out and then she

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.960 
goes 20 seconds all out and then she
rests<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:48.930> say<00:01:49.140> 10<00:01:49.500> seconds<00:01:50.040> we're<00:01:50.909> gonna

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
rests for say 10 seconds we're gonna

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.190 
rests for say 10 seconds we're gonna
change<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.659> here

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
change it up here

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.630 
change it up here
now<00:01:52.950> she's<00:01:53.159> alternating<00:01:54.030> legs<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:56.340> nice

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
now she's alternating legs very nice

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.240 
now she's alternating legs very nice
there<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.240> got<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> alternate<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.020> legs

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
there so you got to alternate your legs

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.649 
there so you got to alternate your legs
notice<00:01:59.250> she's<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.610> moving<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> wrist

notice she's just moving from the wrist
-<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> jump<00:02:01.500> rope<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:01.979> need<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
- when you jump rope you don't need to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.910 
- when you jump rope you don't need to
use<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.640> entire<00:02:02.939> arms<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:04.500> she<00:02:04.740> could

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
use your entire arms so again she could

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
she could rest for 10 seconds and repeat

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
she could rest for 10 seconds and repeat
and<00:02:10.649> make<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> part<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.610> Tabata<00:02:11.970> workout

one okay
and<00:02:34.639> then<00:02:35.450> our<00:02:36.219> crisscross<00:02:37.239> we're<00:02:38.239> gonna<00:02:38.329> give

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and then our crisscross we're gonna give

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.129 
and then our crisscross we're gonna give
that<00:02:38.689> one<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> try

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.959 

there<00:02:42.139> you<00:02:42.290> go<00:02:42.439> so<00:02:43.280> you're<00:02:43.400> making<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.730> mind

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
there you go so you're making the mind

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.959 
there you go so you're making the mind
and<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.359> body<00:02:44.510> work<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:45.049> that<00:02:45.290> whoo<00:02:45.969> that's

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
and the body work on that whoo that's

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.420 
and the body work on that whoo that's
right<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.840> sometimes<00:02:48.469> gets<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:48.980> way<00:02:49.129> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
right here sometimes gets in the way and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
right here sometimes gets in the way and
gets<00:02:49.609> cut<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.150> got<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.359> make<00:02:50.480> sure<00:02:50.659> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
gets cut so you got to make sure you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.059 
gets cut so you got to make sure you
have<00:02:50.930> proper<00:02:51.459> proper<00:02:52.459> hair<00:02:52.669> ties<00:02:52.969> up<00:02:53.949> so<00:02:54.949> it

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
have proper proper hair ties up so it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.069 
have proper proper hair ties up so it
doesn't<00:02:55.400> take<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.730> off<00:02:55.849> there<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:56.900> those

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
doesn't take it off there so so those

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.929 
doesn't take it off there so so those
are<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.319> few<00:02:57.500> different<00:02:57.859> variations<00:02:58.669> of

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
are a few different variations of

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.580 
are a few different variations of
jumping<00:02:59.419> rope<00:02:59.629> and<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.959> lot<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.199> times<00:03:00.409> people

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
jumping rope and a lot of times people

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.920 
jumping rope and a lot of times people
though<00:03:00.889> say<00:03:01.159> you<00:03:01.579> know<00:03:01.699> what<00:03:01.879> I<00:03:01.909> can't<00:03:02.329> I<00:03:02.569> can't

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
though say you know what I can't I can't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.270 
though say you know what I can't I can't
jump<00:03:03.199> rope<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.409> just<00:03:03.560> doesn't<00:03:03.799> work<00:03:03.889> for<00:03:04.040> me

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
jump rope it just doesn't work for me

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520 
jump rope it just doesn't work for me
so<00:03:04.639> for<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.209> clients<00:03:05.659> or<00:03:05.780> students<00:03:06.139> I<00:03:06.260> pull<00:03:06.500> out

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
so for my clients or students I pull out

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.709 
so for my clients or students I pull out
this<00:03:06.889> step<00:03:07.189> bench<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:08.120> might<00:03:08.329> have<00:03:08.540> them

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
this step bench and I might have them

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.220 
this step bench and I might have them
just<00:03:08.900> do<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.079> tap<00:03:09.669> okay<00:03:10.669> in<00:03:10.849> place<00:03:11.389> of<00:03:11.659> it<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.930> so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
just do a tap okay in place of it and so

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.170 
just do a tap okay in place of it and so
they<00:03:12.349> can<00:03:12.530> start<00:03:12.739> off<00:03:12.889> at<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.099> nice<00:03:13.400> easy<00:03:13.760> pace

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
they can start off at a nice easy pace

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.909 
they can start off at a nice easy pace
or<00:03:14.780> eventually<00:03:15.319> go<00:03:15.439> as<00:03:15.590> quick<00:03:15.859> as<00:03:15.980> they<00:03:16.159> can

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
or eventually go as quick as they can

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.830 
or eventually go as quick as they can
that's<00:03:18.919> a<00:03:19.099> little<00:03:19.280> bit<00:03:19.519> more<00:03:19.840> low-impact

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that's a little bit more low-impact

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.920 
that's a little bit more low-impact
works<00:03:21.530> well<00:03:21.799> for<00:03:21.829> some<00:03:22.370> moms<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.540> lot<00:03:23.659> of<00:03:23.750> people

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
works well for some moms a lot of people

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.140 
works well for some moms a lot of people
