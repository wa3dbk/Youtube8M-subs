move sword you've got to go over these
bars<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> road<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> pick<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> speed<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
bars in the road to pick up speed and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
bars in the road to pick up speed and
there<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.070> three<00:00:44.309> laps<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> race<00:00:44.969> there's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
there are three laps in the race there's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
there are three laps in the race there's
a<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> formula<00:00:46.320> tree<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> formula<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> the

formula one lap and the varying
different<00:00:51.510> lengths<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> you've<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
different lengths and you've got to get

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.540 
different lengths and you've got to get
the<00:00:52.590> end<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> lap<00:00:52.920> before<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.250> run<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.460> of

the end of the lap before you run out of
time<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.989> over<00:00:55.020> enough<00:00:55.500> bars

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
time if you don't go over enough bars

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
time if you don't go over enough bars
and<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.750> fast<00:00:58.020> enough<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and you don't go fast enough and you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.040 
and you don't go fast enough and you
don't<00:00:58.680> reach<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> end<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> lap<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> you

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
don't reach the end of the lap and you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't reach the end of the lap and you
lose<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.620> similarly<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> crash<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:02.940> all

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
lose and similarly if you crash into all

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
lose and similarly if you crash into all
the<00:01:03.149> other<00:01:03.210> cars<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> slows<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.260> down

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the other cars that slows you right down

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
the other cars that slows you right down
and<00:01:04.650> again<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> wastes<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.540> might

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and again it wastes time and you might

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.670 
and again it wastes time and you might
not<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> end<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> lap<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> I'll

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
not get to the end of that lap so I'll

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
not get to the end of that lap so I'll
catch<00:01:10.979> goes<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> game<00:01:11.700> boats<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.180> see

catch goes the game boats you can see

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
catch goes the game boats you can see
that<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> action<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.710> showing<00:01:13.830> the

picked up that bar there there's no bar

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
picked up that bar there there's no bar
there<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.369> those<00:01:35.460> call<00:01:35.729> us<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.409> pick<00:01:37.409> them

up<00:01:37.650> game<00:01:38.250> speed<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.290> full<00:01:40.439> speed

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
up game speed so I'm going at full speed

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
up game speed so I'm going at full speed
now<00:01:40.740> trying<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> avoid<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> cars<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.780> over

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
now trying to avoid the cars going over

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
now trying to avoid the cars going over
the<00:01:43.110> bars<00:01:43.430> I've<00:01:44.430> crashed<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the bars I've crashed again be a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
the bars I've crashed again be a
practice<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.350> afraid<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.970> little

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
practice I'm afraid and that little

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.639 
practice I'm afraid and that little
narrow<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.689> indicates<00:01:52.170> where<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> next

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
narrow there indicates where the next

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.920 
narrow there indicates where the next
