now<00:00:26.380> our<00:00:27.380> focus<00:00:27.649> is<00:00:27.980> really<00:00:28.189> on

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
now our focus is really on

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.370 
now our focus is really on
sustainability<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:29.599> doing<00:00:29.899> things<00:00:30.079> in<00:00:30.259> a

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
sustainability and doing things in a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.499 
sustainability and doing things in a
different<00:00:30.410> way<00:00:30.739> so<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.759> biggest<00:00:32.090> saving

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
different way so that the biggest saving

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.299 
different way so that the biggest saving
to<00:00:33.110> us<00:00:33.290> from<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.280> prime<00:00:34.520> era<00:00:35.140> in<00:00:36.140> terms<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:37.010> the

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
to us from the prime era in terms of the

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.590 
to us from the prime era in terms of the
environment<00:00:37.789> is<00:00:37.879> just<00:00:38.089> the<00:00:38.179> fact<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.510> it

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
environment is just the fact that it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.630 
environment is just the fact that it
uses<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.079> much<00:00:39.260> less<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.800> literally<00:00:40.519> the

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
uses so much less that literally the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.299 
uses so much less that literally the
first<00:00:40.879> label<00:00:41.120> out<00:00:41.359> can<00:00:41.660> be<00:00:41.839> a<00:00:41.870> good<00:00:42.109> one<00:00:42.309> and

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
first label out can be a good one and

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.099 
first label out can be a good one and
when<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.760> get<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.480> number<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.929> need<00:00:45.050> to

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
when you get to the number you need to

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.079 
when you get to the number you need to
run<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.859> hit<00:00:46.039> stop<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.339> it<00:00:46.579> stops<00:00:46.850> and

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
run you hit stop and it stops and

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.160 
run you hit stop and it stops and
there's<00:00:47.210> no<00:00:47.300> real<00:00:47.480> waste<00:00:47.690> at<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.899> front

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
there's no real waste at the front

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.770 
there's no real waste at the front
there's<00:00:48.350> no<00:00:48.469> waste<00:00:48.679> of<00:00:48.859> the<00:00:48.949> back<00:00:49.179> that<00:00:50.179> that

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
there's no waste of the back that that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.069 
there's no waste of the back that that
makes<00:00:50.989> sense<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.379> us<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.820> prime<00:00:53.059> era<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:54.050> a

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
makes sense to us the prime era is a

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.930 
makes sense to us the prime era is a
press<00:00:54.440> that's<00:00:54.710> dedicated<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.640> label

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
press that's dedicated to label

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.630 
press that's dedicated to label
manufacturers<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.469> know<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.010> not

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
manufacturers so you know it's it's not

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.790 
manufacturers so you know it's it's not
for<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.030> printers<00:00:59.390> it's<00:00:59.569> for<00:00:59.749> us<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.260> that's

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
for the printers it's for us so that's

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.750 
for the printers it's for us so that's
why<00:01:01.039> we<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:01.730> were<00:01:01.879> drawn<00:01:02.089> to<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.329> press<00:01:03.760> print

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
why we we were drawn to that press print

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.030 
why we we were drawn to that press print
side<00:01:05.030> really<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.200> advantages<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.920> it's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
side really the advantages that it's

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.130 
side really the advantages that it's
it's<00:01:07.580> almost<00:01:07.909> like<00:01:08.090> printing<00:01:08.480> to<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> desktop

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's almost like printing to a desktop

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
wanted a solution that would take it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.380 
wanted a solution that would take it
from<00:01:18.200> front<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.530> back<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.760> in<00:01:19.940> terms<00:01:19.970> of
