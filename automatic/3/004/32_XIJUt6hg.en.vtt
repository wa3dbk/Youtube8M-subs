00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 hello and all with you android 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 android 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.080
 I continue to talk about tanks in this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.139
 video I will tell about tanks 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 Britain's total is obtained from 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 us two branches this upper branch and lower 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 branch but let's start in order 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.400
 well, what is the difference between these tanks and of course 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.769
 communicates very very fast speed and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 very rate of fire but on the other 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.110
 hand they are very lightly armored and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 so keep in mind that this may 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.719
 problem occur upper branch 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 appeared in update 1 and 5 and i see 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.600
 got to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.559
 centurion and here is the lower branch appeared 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 sort of in 1817 update 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 I like 116 about her dough, you already forgot 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.129
 excuse me correct me in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 comments because that 's how it is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.730
 let's start in order of 0 1 2 3 levels 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.799
 I don't remember, but starting from a local historian and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 a cruiser this is like a fool very fast 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.220
 the tank is very fast-fire tank but if 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 you will come across which thread and what 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 keep running away that is better of course 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.990
 use this tank as an assistant yes 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 that is, you are helping some other 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 what kind of tank are you trying to drive around 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.259
 opponent for this tank is very very me 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.600
 the cow cruiser cavern seems to fit 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.220
 already more even faster tank i'm not very 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 fast speed develops one of the most 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.659
 fast tanks in the game here is the top 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.150
 branch at least i mean 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.100
 and get to the room it is generally so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.369
 tank and find ambiguous very quickly 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.860
 he drives to look for tops of this 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
 rate of fire and weak 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.229
 armored asti ie there is a device on 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.240
 get caught queen tank some example 6 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.810
 level how hard he is he can you too 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 to destroy 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 but thanks to the rate of fire if you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.259
 put this tank let me 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.710
 specifically himself did the equipment post 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.629
 used to stand this one 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.660
 you can destroy tanks very quickly 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.580
 especially if 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.890
 some kind of rival some kind of your partner 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.700
 Is someone your team member someone 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910
 firing from up to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.140
 in front and you are busy coming you start me 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.020
 u can shoot three to four 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.810
 the cartridge under the saron of the projectile into it 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.210
 thrust and he will not have time 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.730
 fall but on the other hand if 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.720
 the ride is very tight 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.820
 and artificial you can occupy with it 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.460
 quickly any particular points and with 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.960
 very high speed move around 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.260
 I have now reached the centurion 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.210
 Well, this, too, he is not ambiguous 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.360
 not so fast 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.060
 not so good punches 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.970
 seek and now Katya have advantage 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.550
 British tanks on the upper branches they 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.850
 leave because he is very cool then 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.880
 there is 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.380
 hide somewhere very hard yes all 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.120
 the rest of the tanks could hide 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.930
 comet punishment could hide 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.520
 run away from a very large size 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.780
 rate of fire well, good enough, I 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.610
 would say yes but the armor is very weak if 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.400
 of course life has a lot of new 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.270
 Level 8 tanks are also the same 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.700
 life and breaking through is much better here go 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.420
 head-on useless concrete example 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.480
 bring I fought trying to fight with 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:41.209
 from cisco and d from 1 to level 7 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.730
 tsr branches yes and specifically he instead I 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.850
 him and I in him and I lost because 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 his armor is more demage he has more 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.410
 so keep in mind too 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.660
 which tank which 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.560
 as support use it never 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 climb in the frontal always try to help 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.739
 so now let's branch this lower one 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.180
 A branch and this is 1 update 18 like 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:11.150
 18 update that this thread itself 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.700
 represents but this thread so to speak 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.919
 british tanks yes so begins what 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.359
 Tank here see 2 media whines about them 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.049
 nothing I can say I can Katya 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.140
 matilde 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.070
 matilda super cool tank can say 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.590
 imba 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.300
 I have this tank like now and there 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.910
 yeah i still have 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.420
 why i left but because if you 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.330
 approach this tank on tank 3 4 levels 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.090
 then you can fight against all of them 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.090
 carry all the opposing teams 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.100
 so that they fit them in me 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.840
 Well, not spared you back what 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.300
 advantages of this tank of course 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.760
 struck very cool armor 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.410
 awesome armor in the top she is very 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.420
 steep pierce practically in 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.370
 impossible 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.010
 4 even the fifth level there is no edge 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.780
 pierce the rate of fire just because 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.240
 and that is, instead of this 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.000
 cannon yes she will survive very quickly 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.170
 very fast years though pierce and not such 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.420
 so cool but very fast 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.730
 thousand very quickly shorter shoots but 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.340
 Of course a huge minus Matilde is worth 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.350
 that she is very bear and all 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.720
 tanks on which I played it the most 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.240
 I slow tank game stretches on 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.850
 different there conclusion can not kv-1 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.560
 compare on 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.850
 slow motion but it seems to me 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.680
 so even slower 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.320
 very long move very slowly 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.600
 move while your allies will 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.520
 pounding forward until you have them 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.180
 the sky like a turtle cavity and so 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.010
 very cool then go tanks draws 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.310
 more often i like it so too though 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.940
 Churchill's unequivocal tank 1 Churchill 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.090
 7 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.230
 wearing one is also very good 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.300
 booked about on the other hand of course 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.730
 there are downsides to this tank as you 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.040
 see here but of course I can show 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.810
 his caterpillars are so arranged that they are very 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.060
 hard to unfold yes here in place 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.160
 very hard 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.550
 turns around here but on the other hand 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.640
 Of course, armor prescription saves it 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.310
 same very cool rate yet 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.220
 minus the fact that he has a very dragging tower 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.310
 low angle falls so too 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.980
 you will have to go with him Churchill 7 too 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.080
 nice tank tried too 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.290
 armored axle repeats strongly 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.850
 almost completely churchill and 1 but 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.260
 more carry improved 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.300
 characteristics 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.280
 Of course, planning to buy a black prince 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.730
 mandatory all the other tanks of it 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.460
 level here as there is a premium tanks 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.920
 matilda bp didn't play can't say a 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.110
 Here are the tanks that are armored 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.540
 then I didn’t play them but I’m with him 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.460
 met to get infected this is hellish 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.630
 booking a tank is very hard to break through 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.640
 especially there below level 5 6 very 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.880
 scary so basically falls back 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.620
 shoot him that's all i told 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.970
 about the British tanks shared their experience 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.930
 maybe when I have accumulated dozens 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:19.060
 I will continue to carry my review of this branch with 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.060
 you were android android
