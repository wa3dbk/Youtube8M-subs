pro is that it has close to no charge
time<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.180> makes<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> hard<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.140> escape<00:00:28.410> and

so yeah the second Pro and we will talk
about<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> concept<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> poser<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
about the concept of the poser the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.510 
about the concept of the poser the
second<00:00:40.410> Pro<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> uses<00:00:41.040> instant

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
second Pro is that it uses instant

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.799 
second Pro is that it uses instant
transmission<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.300> means<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.719> more

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
transmission which means it or more

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.209 
transmission which means it or more
running<00:00:43.079> across<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> map<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> try<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> charge

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
running across the map to try to charge

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
running across the map to try to charge
their<00:00:44.520> key<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.210> wait<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.570> their<00:00:45.840> stamina

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
their key or wait for their stamina

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
their key or wait for their stamina
recover<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.190> like

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
recover because you can just like

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
recover because you can just like
instant<00:00:48.180> recognition<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.260> front<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
instant recognition right in front of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
instant recognition right in front of
them<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.680> use<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.850> fourth<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> final

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
them and use it on the fourth and final

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
them and use it on the fourth and final
pro<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.590> I've<00:00:52.739> seen<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:54.030> if

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
pro that I've seen to it is that if

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
pro that I've seen to it is that if
someone<00:00:54.960> uses<00:00:55.140> an<00:00:55.379> ultimate<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.949> super

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
someone uses an ultimate like super

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.670 
someone uses an ultimate like super
spirit<00:00:56.460> promise<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.879> vanishing<00:00:57.149> ball<00:00:57.420> etc

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
spirit promise to be vanishing ball etc

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160 
spirit promise to be vanishing ball etc
you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.710> evade<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> deal<00:01:00.030> damage<00:01:00.629> by

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you can evade it and deal damage by

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
you can evade it and deal damage by
using<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> Warped<00:01:02.070> Kamehameha<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
using the Warped Kamehameha because it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you can instant transmission right in

use<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> plane<00:01:37.710> super<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.549> damage<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
use a plane super which can go damage to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.010 
use a plane super which can go damage to
you<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> cost<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> game<00:01:40.320> um<00:01:41.360> yeah<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you and cost you the game um yeah that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.280 
you and cost you the game um yeah that
would<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:43.740> bad<00:01:44.100> uh<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> second

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
would be very very bad uh so the second

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
would be very very bad uh so the second
con<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.189> blocked<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.640> won't<00:01:47.790> do

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
con would be if it's blocked it won't do

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
con would be if it's blocked it won't do
much<00:01:48.060> damage<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> enemy's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
much damage at all to the enemy's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
much damage at all to the enemy's
stamina<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.000> ultimate<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.509> fast

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
stamina because it the ultimate so fast

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.639 
stamina because it the ultimate so fast
that<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.430> won't<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.930> do<00:01:54.930> any<00:01:55.110> damage<00:01:55.409> their

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that it won't really do any damage their

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
that it won't really do any damage their
statement<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.549> fast<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
statement because like it's so fast that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.639 
statement because like it's so fast that
it<00:01:57.329> will<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.689> take<00:01:57.750> away<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> bar<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it will just take away like a bar to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.780 
it will just take away like a bar to
stand<00:01:59.040> man<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> um<00:02:00.860> yeah<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.399> last

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
stand man that's it um yeah so the last

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.539 
stand man that's it um yeah so the last
con<00:02:03.119> would<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.530> move<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
con would be is if the move is that the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
con would be is if the move is that the
move<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.729> powerless<00:02:06.270> against<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> skilled

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
move is powerless against a skilled

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
move is powerless against a skilled
player<00:02:06.930> skilled<00:02:07.680> player<00:02:07.829> will<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.099> the

move<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:17.750> not<00:03:17.930> useful<00:03:18.350> unless<00:03:18.859> you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
move it's really not useful unless you

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.340 
move it's really not useful unless you
have<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.160> key<00:03:19.340> character<00:03:19.790> obviously<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.510> it's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
have a key character obviously and it's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.640 
have a key character obviously and it's
really<00:03:21.709> like<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.690> takes<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:24.019> lot<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.230> skill<00:03:24.560> to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
really like it's takes a lot of skill to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.110 
really like it's takes a lot of skill to
use<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.890> move<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:25.549> just<00:03:25.850> like<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.090> just

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
use this move because just like you just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240 
use this move because just like you just
seen<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.570> screen<00:03:26.690> they<00:03:27.320> can<00:03:27.500> t<00:03:27.590> vate<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.980> even

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
seen on screen they can t vate it even

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.500 
seen on screen they can t vate it even
if<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.489> about<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> little<00:03:28.820> less<00:03:29.030> bit<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:29.480> just

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
if it's about a little less bit so just

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.750 
if it's about a little less bit so just
be<00:03:29.810> careful<00:03:29.959> for<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.380> anyways<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.400> hope<00:03:31.519> you
