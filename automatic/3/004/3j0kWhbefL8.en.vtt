00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.419
 hello my name is lars where i bake 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 blogging on the topic productive in 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.870
 digital times 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.940
 Today I want a stylus again 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.589
 for you to test the new brokers or 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.019
 marco is not so new he does not come 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.639
 from england was a recommendation for me 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.960
 is the new one because he is relatively unknown 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.699
 is here with us but this time it was 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.289
 differently I do not only test the styles 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.580
 I am testing the times directly against two 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.830
 others donate so we total 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.810
 three could have liked to compare 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.070
 because in the end anyway could always 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.320
 ask what is his now 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.100
 favorite pen and I want you 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.300
 answer today at the end of the video 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.730
 before common sense pin but here with 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 good times different writes again in the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.289
 search window in the hud notes and from the first 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.960
 I have to say that there is no feeling 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.370
 cheap feeling that writes resistance 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.379
 I would say so in midfield 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 it's not quite as slippery again bamboo 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.600
 but not as hard as the rotring 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.520
 that makes a good impression 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.320
 So what now the big pluses 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.760
 are definitely the first feel 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.430
 to be called full metal or 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.699
 All-aluminum is the pen of the year 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.920
 song really in the hand has one 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.930
 nice lace front not too tight and 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.150
 It is really hard to give way 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.640
 So that's really a great thing 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.110
 So really great from the feel 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.000
 the same is true of course for the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.550
 processing also over any doubt 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 sublime he has these little rubber 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.950
 inlets on the side 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 So it's a bit better in the hand 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.940
 it is super processed 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.980
 this also applies to the scope of delivery i 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.690
 was very impressed when I first 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.540
 once he has unpacked so he comes one 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.270
 send box therefore here you can see them there 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.710
 is a very nice cassette in it and 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.020
 the whole one just had fun while 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.399
 unpack so 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.929
 The market must be practically out and there 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.640
 you can see what is involved and then 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.170
 The first thing you notice is this tile 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.539
 that there can be such a magnet holder 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.579
 I simply stick to the ipad cover and 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.439
 to fix the donator he has so 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.670
 magnets in there but come soon 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.439
 to here the pin with these occasions on 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.289
 the side and the beautiful tip with it 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.240
 he good you here so that he is good in hand 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.030
 lies or to fasten with it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 do not scratch nice and then there is still 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.349
 such a tube that is known so 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.870
 Anyway from keychains there can 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.450
 screw it up and there it is 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 Replacement tip in it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 A very nice idea already makes 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 when unpacking makes it fun to 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.019
 really screw the scope of delivery 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.940
 is really great, yes then I have 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.519
 already said the magnet holder so there 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 So special magnets are two pieces in 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.590
 the pen in it so I so yes 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.569
 on the ipad just like that with the magnets 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.799
 I can fix ipad first 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.599
 Now with the cover and I can do that 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.930
 Now down here, just moor that 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.340
 holds then slips here in the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.780
 middle so really great thing you have 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.579
 that does not fly around loose one has 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.850
 always there, yes, the big point 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.680
 but is the wide and thick lace 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.829
 So she has me writing now 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.880
 really a bit disturbed 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.139
 You can recognize it especially well if 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.819
 you look at it from the side now 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.799
 look here you can see the thick tip 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.569
 the broker so you see comes from 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.120
 above what you write she lets herself 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.769
 Although hardly impress, but this already 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.510
 very wide then the red ring 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.329
 already a bit narrow and very sharp 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.950
 of course here the cs 160 due to the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.709
 Carbon fiber The braid can be so 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.389
 a bit push but really 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.310
 much narrower man looks rather if 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.260
 Now you look from the top it looks 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.540
 of course the bottom of the bamboo is very narrow 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.220
 the market must be really powerful but the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.669
 you can really see sharp points here 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.709
 very different very very thick at 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.019
 the man plus here in comparison 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.819
 directly to the red wrestling of the diameter 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.980
 about the same but was red 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.660
 just tip to see through it 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
 again a little bit more 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 and here now the comparison then too 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
 the bamboo 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.980
 on the left in the cs 160 you can see how small 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 the top, on the other hand, is in contrast to 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.909
 get rid of the market 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.310
 yes then again just so what 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.370
 have the cs 160 left bamboo against the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.609
 rotring also since the cs a 60 a lot 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.170
 a much smaller top yes all three 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.750
 really great donors great 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.480
 processed great optics that's hard 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.000
 to find a favorite out of the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.190
 rotring is something for me 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.949
 occasion writer made lace 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.960
 needs a lot of pressure until 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.000
 of course unique with the pressure 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.620
 but one can unscrew one 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.850
 really rather something for the occasion 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.930
 Scribe the challenger the broker 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.000
 really is great in the hand hard 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.280
 is fun to touch 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.600
 but has an extremely thick pointy and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 there is nothing for a lot 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.740
 Schreiber is what to draw for drawing 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.090
 he is really great for that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.330
 fun makes it easy to handle as well 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.080
 and now it's my favorite 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.030
 pen is still the bamboo cs 160's 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.800
 Although a bit narrow, it will not be that way 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.860
 heavy in the hand like the other two 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.479
 but with this carbon fiber stifter makes 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.860
 that's just fun and she is 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.720
 much narrower than the others 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.820
 and that is for many writers like me 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.520
 really a co-criterion so that is 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.560
 still my favorite pen yes 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.360
