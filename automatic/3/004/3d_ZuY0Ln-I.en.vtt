00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.820
 nice all guys hello here at the mixer e 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 today I will show you how to remove e 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.639
 you are well to totally feel the lag 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.859
 from minecraft I tried it over and over 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.260
 sometimes even in different computers and vi 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.800
 I assure you that it works for you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.119
 windows xp and mac windows 7 and linux 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.039
 that is, it should work in theory 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.210
 work 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.920
 I make a small premise I do 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
 see the before and after of my minecraft 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 this is the first one when you start it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.620
 normally we say it should tie up 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.590
 here you see that we are shooting with 30 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.400
 fps that to me of nature we say not lanka 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.690
 too, however, you see that already many are going 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.379
 shots we don't even see how 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.190
 improve it we say yes to 1 million if 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.490
 one goes shooting instead gr knew not 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 well let's see immediately how to do it but of 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 we all need a program 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.009
 which I will give you a link in the description 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.100
 called game booster 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.500
 Many of you already know, however, 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.800
 this is not enough for not doing 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.360
 the more the minecraft races they serve others 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.550
 programs but let's start seeing this 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 then once we have downloaded 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.360
 installed vi and booster we open it and in 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.020
 theory we should find ourselves in this 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 screen first let's go up 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.820
 tools and optimizes 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.390
 and you should have all these 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.720
 optimized 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.090
 if instead you have someone not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.070
 optimized checkbox so that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.020
 you should have it up here and then 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.410
 selected optimize I do it because 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.410
 tip I have it to everyone optimized 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.530
 anyway, let's play gamebox here 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.990
 we have to do add and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.880
 we select from our desktop where it is 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.610
 we have it 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.290
 the minecraft game but in what we do 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.560
 apa I don't do it precisely because there is 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.040
 I already have it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 and we must find ourselves together with the others 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.030
 games that will already be present 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.320
 never ever so far that he calls and then 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.320
 we make spear envelopes 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.660
 here's here apparently it would seem that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.680
 minecraft has opened normally is 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.530
 well 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 many say it is enough to do this e 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.270
 minecraft l'on la gabin here I tell you 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.020
 with game booster we say minecraft l'on 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.770
 laga 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.010
 at the beginning after 5 6 minutes it starts like 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.180
 as usual and I tell you from experience 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.459
 what we have to do once we have it 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.319
 open minecraft this way we have 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.709
 a premier and control alt and kicks e 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.690
 now 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.010
 oh well it will open a screen that you 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.530
 you ca n't come because of 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.310
 registration, however, you do against the UDC 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.680
 anise and you will find a screen with 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.450
 blog computer change user log off 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.260
 changed password he had an activity jersey 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.260
 we click to manage activities ed 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.870
 here it will open leaguers activities 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.700
 of windows that you can also call 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.700
 task manager as you like and we'll be there 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.100
 precisely this window with applications 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.650
 and processes and services performance and networks 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.470
 and users 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.299
 then they must go on processes and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.060
 look for in this almost endless 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:58.549
 list a file called here it is 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.049
 java java exe a point w in fact a former 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.010
 Once we have found it we do 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:10.430
 right button sets priority without 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:14.359
 click we go to this tab here and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.539
 select high here we make modification 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:22.160
 priority once done right key of 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:26.539
 new set affinity we find ourselves 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.850
 here all the GPUs remove them all except 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:35.300
 cp1 we do ok and once done 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.449
 we close everything we see also we go to 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.449
 see how it will go in kraft 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.060
 before we were on the 30 fps I care about 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.060
 to remember 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.749
 here now 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.080
 we're back on the fooling trends 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.080
 a moment that maybe the bio 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.890
 anyway 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:09.800
 okay we are always on 30 fps though 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:14.960
 you see it I do not know compares 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:18.340
 first, in my opinion, Romilio let's try 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.340
 also to increase the distance we do 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 do 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.730
 and see that even with a very long distance 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.290
 long 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.630
 minecraft is fine and I assure you a hundred 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:41.680
 percent that this method works 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:41.680
 then the seeds then try it immediately and 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.330
 and nothing 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.330
 enjoy yourselves 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.879
 thank you all for your attention 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.500
 subscribe to comment once 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.180
 you will close the game automatically 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.099
 the booster was not the return the 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.020
 computer in normal mode and that's fine 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.599
 precisely thanks 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.349
 subscribe comment and hello to everyone 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.349
 boys with tantrums
