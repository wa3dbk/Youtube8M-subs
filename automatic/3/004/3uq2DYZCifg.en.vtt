this is first thing in the morning after

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.290 
this is first thing in the morning after
I've<00:05:09.410> just<00:05:09.530> had<00:05:09.680> some<00:05:09.800> water<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.820> really

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
I've just had some water so really

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.920 
I've just had some water so really
pleased<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:12.380> progress<00:05:13.480> around<00:05:14.480> my

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
pleased with that progress around my

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.110 
pleased with that progress around my
hips<00:05:15.260> my<00:05:15.500> hips<00:05:15.830> have<00:05:16.010> always<00:05:16.370> been<00:05:16.580> enormous

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
hips my hips have always been enormous

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.940 
hips my hips have always been enormous
I've<00:05:17.270> always<00:05:17.450> hated<00:05:17.630> my<00:05:17.930> hips<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.380> my<00:05:18.710> butt

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
I've always hated my hips and my butt

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.920 
I've always hated my hips and my butt
which<00:05:19.490> always<00:05:19.730> has<00:05:20.240> always<00:05:20.330> been<00:05:20.600> in<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.780> way

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
which always has always been in the way

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.770 
which always has always been in the way
but<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.440> guess<00:05:21.620> that's<00:05:21.860> just<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.670> way<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.390> was

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
but I guess that's just the way I was

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.890 
but I guess that's just the way I was
built<00:05:24.020> but<00:05:24.640> lost<00:05:25.640> weight<00:05:25.880> around<00:05:26.060> my<00:05:26.360> hips<00:05:26.660> as

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
built but lost weight around my hips as

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.540 
built but lost weight around my hips as
well<00:05:27.080> which<00:05:27.290> is<00:05:27.320> really<00:05:27.470> where<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.040> measure<00:05:28.430> my

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
well which is really where I measure my

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.910 
well which is really where I measure my
