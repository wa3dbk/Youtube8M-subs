00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
like that I really do it's a really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
like that I really do it's a really
well-made<00:01:46.439> device<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.520> looking<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> rest

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
well-made device so looking at the rest

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
well-made device so looking at the rest
of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> phone<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.409> display<00:01:49.829> size<00:01:50.130> has<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> 4.5

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of the phone the display size has a 4.5

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
of the phone the display size has a 4.5
inch<00:01:51.750> screen<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.590> resolution<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.869> 854<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.110> 480

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
inch screen the resolution is 854 by 480

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459 
inch screen the resolution is 854 by 480
so<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> 720p<00:01:57.079> but<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.320> has<00:01:58.439> a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
looking at the store that I want to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.020 
looking at the store that I want to
point<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.920> application<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.670> only

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030

running 512 megabytes worth of RAM so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.900 
running 512 megabytes worth of RAM so
it's<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.530> gigabyte<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.610> that's<00:03:35.790> gonna
