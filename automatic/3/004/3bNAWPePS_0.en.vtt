00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
my machine as one piece and I'm going to

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.140 
my machine as one piece and I'm going to
attach<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:36.949> to<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:37.610> canvas<00:00:38.230> using<00:00:40.150> gel

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
attach that to this canvas using gel

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.380 
attach that to this canvas using gel
medium<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.019> back<00:00:42.409> I<00:00:42.860> could<00:00:43.519> probably<00:00:43.850> do

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
medium on the back I could probably do

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.329 
medium on the back I could probably do
water<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:45.260> would<00:00:45.350> stick<00:00:45.620> fine<00:00:45.860> because<00:00:46.100> it

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
water and it would stick fine because it

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.780 
water and it would stick fine because it
is<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.970> shape<00:00:47.210> or<00:00:47.360> paper<00:00:47.540> on<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.839> back<00:00:47.989> but

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
is the shape or paper on the back but

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.549 
is the shape or paper on the back but
I'm<00:00:49.790> just<00:00:50.000> gonna<00:00:50.150> do<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.479> gel<00:00:50.689> medium<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:54.199> I'm

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
I'm just gonna do the gel medium and I'm

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.310 
I'm just gonna do the gel medium and I'm
gonna<00:00:54.799> put<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.220> right<00:00:55.549> here<00:00:58.900> press<00:00:59.900> that<00:01:00.080> on

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320

now I'm gonna take some of this tile
backer<00:01:02.629> tape<00:01:03.040> because<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.189> think<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:04.699> would

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
backer tape because I think this would

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.800 
backer tape because I think this would
be<00:01:05.030> fabulous<00:01:05.689> to<00:01:05.900> build<00:01:06.110> up<00:01:07.119> another<00:01:08.119> kind<00:01:08.720> of

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
be fabulous to build up another kind of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.630 
be fabulous to build up another kind of
fabric<00:01:09.409> e<00:01:09.530> surface<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.770> again<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.369> would

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
fabric e surface and again this would

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.200 
fabric e surface and again this would
stick<00:01:14.229> but<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.259> am<00:01:15.740> going<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.369> actually<00:01:16.670> do<00:01:17.180> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
stick but I am going to actually do a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.140 
stick but I am going to actually do a
little<00:01:17.360> gel<00:01:17.659> medium<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.850> I'm<00:01:23.000> going

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
little gel medium on that and I'm going

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.830

to<00:01:23.180> press<00:01:23.540> that<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:25.510> I'm<00:01:26.510> going<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.750> add

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
to press that in and I'm going to add

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.130 
to press that in and I'm going to add
this<00:01:27.050> piece<00:01:27.350> right<00:01:27.680> down<00:01:27.920> here<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.780> I'm<00:01:33.020> gonna

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
got I got a little water because this is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.650 
got I got a little water because this is
still<00:02:38.650> kind<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.489> wet<00:02:39.550> but<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.030> see<00:02:40.269> this

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
still kind of wet but you can see this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.449 
still kind of wet but you can see this
tile<00:02:41.470> paper<00:02:41.800> child<00:02:42.760> tape<00:02:43.420> when<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:43.750> painted

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
tile paper child tape when it's painted

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.960 
tile paper child tape when it's painted
gives<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:46.090> cool<00:02:47.250> texture<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.640> surface

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
gives a really cool texture and surface

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.089 
gives a really cool texture and surface
to<00:02:49.360> paint<00:02:49.569> on<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:56.019> again<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.470> would<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.950> be

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
to paint on so again this would just be

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.180 
to paint on so again this would just be
the<00:02:57.250> beginning<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.650> know<00:02:59.680> probably<00:03:00.040> like

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the beginning of you know probably like

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.130 
the beginning of you know probably like
15<00:03:00.640> lighters<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.150> would<00:03:01.299> do<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.660> piece<00:03:01.900> but

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
15 lighters I would do on this piece but

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.319 
15 lighters I would do on this piece but
it<00:03:02.230> gives<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.530> idea<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.970> some<00:03:04.120> ways

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
it gives you the idea of just some ways

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.259 
it gives you the idea of just some ways
to<00:03:04.599> build<00:03:04.780> up<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:06.040> not<00:03:06.549> be<00:03:06.700> afraid<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.060> that

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
to build up and not be afraid of that

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.920 
to build up and not be afraid of that
white<00:03:07.510> canvas<00:03:07.840> staring<00:03:08.440> at<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.780> would

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
white canvas staring at you and I would

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:20.350 
white canvas staring at you and I would
paint<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.230> sides<00:03:17.040> fantastic

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.820 

now<00:03:21.230> another<00:03:21.500> thing<00:03:21.620> about<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:23.560> tile<00:03:24.560> paper

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.070 
now another thing about this tile paper
is<00:03:25.190> because<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.910> tagging<00:03:26.270> off<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.600> almost<00:03:26.780> think

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
is because of tagging off I almost think

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.840 
is because of tagging off I almost think

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850
