00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.420
Why did I choose fried bread with minced pork spread?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.060
I chose it because

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.120
minced pork is commonly available.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.740
And also the bread. They are the food we normally stock in our fridge.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.340
So, it's the best choice to make this attractive and delicious finger food.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900
First, we need to prepare the dip.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.520
 Simmer the vinegar with sugar and a little salt.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.160
It should be sweet, sour and a little salty.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.940
Do not sniff the dip while cooking.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.520
It will irritate your nose.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.340
 Cook until all the ingredients are mixed well

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120
and the liquid reduces a little. Turn off the heat.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
When you have finished the dip,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.400
prepare the bread.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.260
You can use sandwich bread or baguette, or even the leftover bread.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 Once we have finished cutting the bread, ovendry them in the oven. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080
You can use a toaster or a griller.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.660
Just make sure not to overcook them.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.160
Set the temperature to 150 degree Celsius.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.480
And set the timer for 10 minutes.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.400
Meanwhile, prepare the pork.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.820
 We're going to mix it with coriander roots

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.380
and garlic.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.060
Use Thai garlic, not Chinese garlic.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.320
Add the pepper.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320
Pound finely.

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:08.835
 Ah, very aromatic.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.060
Use the minced pork without fat attached.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.720
You can use rump.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.320
But I'm using tenderloin this time. I'm going to chop it myself.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.780
Add the light soy sauce

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 and about 2 tablespoons of water to season.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.740
Crack the egg into a bowl.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.260
Beat to combine.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.860
Pour half of it into the minced pork.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.680
The other half is for spreading on top of the pork

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.080
just before frying.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.440
Use your hand.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.060
When it is well blended and sticky like pork balls,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.960
it is ready to spread over the bread.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:01.357
Chili strips to garnish.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.020
Once everything is ready,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.400
spread the minced pork over the bread with the center sticking out in round shape.

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:22.056
You can let everyone in your family help you in this process.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.040
So you will not be alone in the kitchen.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.580
The beaten egg will help

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.920
stick the pork and the bread together,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.580
and make them look great after frying.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.160
Place each of the coriander leaves on every single slice of bread,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.500
along with chili strips.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.220
They are now ready to cook.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.240
The oil is already hot.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.780
I'm going to test it with drops of beaten egg. 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.560
Ah, very hot. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.880
Fry with the pork side down.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.620
You have to observe the change in color of each piece. 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.080
When they turn lightly brown, flip at once.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.400
It smells tempting.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.000
And really delicious!

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.480
Next, prepare the dip

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.240
to serve with the fried bread.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.660
This is such a happiness.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.920
With the sour and sweet dip

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.960
and the freshly fried bread with minced pork spread come together,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.720
just one bite you can feel tenderness

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.860
as well as crunchiness

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.900
and the delicious taste in your mouth.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.920
This snack will be finished in a flash.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.320
Fried bread with minced pork spread is as easy as a pie.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.280
I can do it and you can do it too. COOK IT YOURSELF!
