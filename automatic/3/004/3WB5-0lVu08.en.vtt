than any of the other titles I
personally<00:01:22.369> like<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:22.579> start<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.939> game<00:01:23.060> by

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
personally like to start the game by

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.910 
personally like to start the game by
just<00:01:23.420> spinning<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:23.960> on<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.350> table

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
just spinning it on the table

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.099 
just spinning it on the table
flipping<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.609> over<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:25.909> that's<00:01:26.810> where<00:01:27.020> you

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
flipping it over and that's where you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.940 
flipping it over and that's where you
begin<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.450> size<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.259> surface<00:01:30.829> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
begin so the size of the surface that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.520 
begin so the size of the surface that
you're<00:01:31.070> playing<00:01:31.310> on<00:01:31.609> determines<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.929> surface

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
you're playing on determines the surface

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.620 
you're playing on determines the surface
area<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.039> your<00:01:34.189> game<00:01:34.460> board<00:01:34.670> cypresses<00:01:35.509> if

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
you're playing on a table the size of

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.760 
you're playing on a table the size of
the<00:01:37.640> table<00:01:37.789> is<00:01:38.030> how<00:01:38.149> big<00:01:38.390> your<00:01:38.539> game<00:01:38.719> area<00:01:39.499> will

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the table is how big your game area will

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.190 
the table is how big your game area will
be<00:01:41.679> there<00:01:42.679> are<00:01:42.770> four<00:01:43.070> different<00:01:43.689> parts<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.929> the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
be there are four different parts to the

that's<00:02:09.110> really<00:02:09.379> great<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.099> during<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
that's really great is that during the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.240 
that's really great is that during the
placement<00:02:11.629> phase<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.410> can<00:02:12.620> try<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.830> influence

that's in the completed city a monk is
scored<00:03:45.829> when<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.600> cloister<00:03:47.600> he's<00:03:47.780> on<00:03:47.959> is

so therefore you get nine points per
cluster<00:03:54.829> eight<00:03:55.519> for<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:55.970> surrounding<00:03:56.480> tiles

Farmar is a special consideration he

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.930 
Farmar is a special consideration he
only<00:04:03.620> gets<00:04:03.799> scored<00:04:04.040> at<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.280> end<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.790> we'll

to connect those features and then the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
points for the feature once it is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.550 
points for the feature once it is
complete<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.210> if<00:04:32.600> you're<00:04:32.720> really<00:04:32.990> devious

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
complete and if you're really devious

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.580 
complete and if you're really devious
you<00:04:33.889> can<00:04:34.520> make<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.600> have<00:04:36.260> more
