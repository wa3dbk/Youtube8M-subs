00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.129
 I hope this one of you now 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 I'm fine 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.150
 you can see in the background at the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 largest pyramid on the whole wide 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 big world minecraft says yes and it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 is a dear big pyramid more than 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 The 1 million blocks is over 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 the whole map but that's why it was like 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.019
 you are not here but the problem is 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 I have a video set but because 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.260
 delete the same again because I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.229
 Now this video again 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.879
 record because there are missing a few small 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.979
 facts that I just found out 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 have where I thought they would have 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.119
 absolutely also be made pure 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.589
 As I said, the more likes the more 

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.049
 try it out but i will not 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.790
 mandatory to a like it is voluntary 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.890
 it would help me with the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.510
 biggest project of minecraft if you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.979
 are for it and want to support me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 thank you on this page 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.409
 for that you also get a gratitude 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.560
 Back where I'm doing videos 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.010
 or winning games or other games 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.020
 stuff 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.380
 so now we just come to the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.079
 compared or colored objects 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
 the items are called armor now 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.770
 Just look at that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.549
 Problem is not for people who 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 do not know it yet 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.170
 chains helmet iron helmet gold helmet and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.030
 diamonds again 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.859
 you can get it all up to this gold 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.009
 Do not dye boots you can only 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.649
 leather boots leather pants and tunic tunics 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.289
 or turn like leather cap dye 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.090
 such a shame it's just a shame it has 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.060
 not in demand is like a kitchen 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.469
 black and white or turn but different 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.299
 then already if we already have to 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.210
 to deal with that with us 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.729
 Four species come clearly and for that 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.850
 we still need color in the game 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
 that means we always take a rose 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 dandelion yellow once light blue color 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.689
 and one of those color then we go 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.179
 with triangle in then we go with 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.039
 him on the playstation with ticks on 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.409
 the color on it then we just go 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.880
 on the objects that we paint 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.740
 would have to over here at this point 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.950
 want wanted his horses 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.370
 want square and one here 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.840
 can quickly it can be dyed yellow 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.459
 so now we do that with the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.790
 light blue color with leather pants 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.980
 square on it and we have it all 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.230
 that can of course also wear 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.750
 Run around like a rainbow euro 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.700
 but sign my friends 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.230
 therefore've got just the video again 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.459
 but I noticed something 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.400
 again, when we have the items 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.819
 take out and then we take to 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.099
 example the yellow color dandelion yellow 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.360
 and then go to the blue leather pants 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.950
 such things happen 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 We Just have a look on what 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.810
 we happen to dye this high so 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.299
 continue when we come again it is a lot 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.129
 Wieland in the background and that can 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.200
 one repeated again and again 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.750
 change with other colors and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.390
 creations it makes evil bock easy 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.209
 so colorful here in the creative too 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.569
 test it again in survival 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.120
 imitate 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.690
 that's how I roughly know them 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.640
 changed 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.530
 well and good, I hope that once the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840
 own measure if it was the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.599
