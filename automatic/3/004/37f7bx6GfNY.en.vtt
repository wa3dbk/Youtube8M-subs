 more of my car also does not have the microphone 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.630

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.749
 one thing 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.239
 it gets much more clicked on it 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.710
 This is what it can explain but it expects a lot of people 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.940
 good first time to recover 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.460
 now in case 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 I have so many memories that happen after a computer 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.230
 normal no registration here 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.400

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.570
 here all year round 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 I have to impose a way of producing 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.690
 and I record the fifth 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.990
 has not reached its peak 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.190
 and where they live 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.270
 and reform of which the dna found naturally 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.180
 i record holder andré bradford went to the traditional pedestal registered 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.450
 There is no source I did not see. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.760
 microphone 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 here at the peddler 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 that this fact of this problem that I 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.950

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.200
 They are 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.619
 how's it going to do between normal classroom video tie 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.149
 but it will record 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.169
 and that she did not work will only come in after staying 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.919
 it's out of order if you say one thing and pass another video alongside 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.549
 So you're talking in English? 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.809

 some pay for a long time 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.979
 I've seen the problem is that some kind of skin like that someone asks 3d 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.999
 can handle quickly and with the fact that the formats 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.740
 did you see candlestick 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.069

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.929
 under the visual aspect 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.219
 you have to keep away 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.479
 lack of tokyo 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.019
