00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.560 

Windows<00:00:20.279> 10<00:00:20.550> might<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.180> different

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Windows 10 might not look that different

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050 
Windows 10 might not look that different
from<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> last<00:00:22.199> Windows<00:00:22.619> 8.1<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.699> once<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
from the last Windows 8.1 but once you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580 
from the last Windows 8.1 but once you
start<00:00:24.300> using<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:24.960> some<00:00:25.170> cool<00:00:25.380> new

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
start using it there are some cool new

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
start using it there are some cool new
features<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.580> guess<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> question<00:00:27.240> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
features but I guess the question is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.810 
features but I guess the question is
should<00:00:28.170> everyone<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.680> least<00:00:28.830> try<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
should everyone at least try it or is it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
should everyone at least try it or is it
just<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.150> small<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.810> significant<00:00:31.439> upgrade<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
just a small and significant upgrade so

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
just a small and significant upgrade so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
can go into the sound settings but I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.009 
can go into the sound settings but I
like<00:03:23.670> being<00:03:23.910> used<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.180> change<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.600> sound<00:03:24.870> of

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
different apps right on the taskbar and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.330 
different apps right on the taskbar and
there<00:03:27.570> may<00:03:27.750> still<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.709> do<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.130> but

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
there may still be a way to do that but

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.699 
there may still be a way to do that but
I<00:03:29.400> haven't<00:03:29.640> figured<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.239> out<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.440> another

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
I haven't figured it out but another

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.530 
I haven't figured it out but another
thing<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:32.850> soon<00:03:32.970> as<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.209> installed

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
thing is that as soon as I installed

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.420 
thing is that as soon as I installed
Windows<00:03:33.930> 10<00:03:34.200> my<00:03:34.440> audio<00:03:34.829> drivers<00:03:35.220> went

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Windows 10 my audio drivers went

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.819 
Windows 10 my audio drivers went
completely<00:03:35.820> missing<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.380> actually<00:03:37.410> took

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
completely missing and it actually took

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.440 
completely missing and it actually took
me<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> couple<00:03:38.100> hours<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.700> figure<00:03:38.880> out<00:03:39.090> what<00:03:39.299> was

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
me a couple hours to figure out what was

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.420 
me a couple hours to figure out what was
wrong<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.900> how<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> fix<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.130> aside<00:03:41.370> from

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
wrong and how to fix it but aside from

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
wrong and how to fix it but aside from
these<00:03:41.670> minor<00:03:41.940> gripes<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.420> do<00:03:42.480> actually<00:03:42.690> really

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
these minor gripes I do actually really

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.199 
these minor gripes I do actually really
like<00:03:43.440> Windows<00:03:43.829> 10<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.280> far<00:03:44.549> there's<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.000> lot<00:03:45.180> of
