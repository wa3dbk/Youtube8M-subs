00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 and good evening to all the planes 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 find for a new video 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 as I promised you tonight 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 It's the big night 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 we will try to exorcise a gel to our 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.869
 papn so the technique is not very hard 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 I think many do not know her I 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 I'll show you right now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.430
 sorry for bread so I take the tale 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 of love what is the jewel mag 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.370
 without so the better it is to be sense I 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.210
 think otherwise you have no chance 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 already that chances are low 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:01.940
 a stupidity here is the most important 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.940
 is the no of course 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:14.729
 and so here is the most used finally 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 as a technique it is therefore already 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.689
 break the p1 mainly his 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 ruins of used but but it changes 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.590
 nothing is more than it is faster 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.100
 with those it surely go with 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100
 others too 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.530
 once that sees that the pea 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.880
 left we go on runes pm east 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:59.040
 one thing to do is to pray that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:07.430
 the father the pm goes through my little fail 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.430
 do not know why there will be a ring 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.420
 yes ok I understood 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:30.070
 we will start again ok it's gone 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.990
 go by a famous antifi it's 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:56.960
 really lucky for the pm 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:56.960
 pass and rifles ruins 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.670
 it's great him in the previous 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.710
 video managed in pack lansade su priori I 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.180
 'm not ruin the ruin 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.630
 because the streets he got to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:43.830
 from another good tip we're going 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:48.030
 attempt to say a bombing am 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.230
 stayed ten years at the time of putting think 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.209
 I'm not a lot of France tonight 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 Cedric the pen passes on the last 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.570
 wayne has never and no and no and no 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.490
 and not great thank you very much sir 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.680
 to house the teen I will still posted the 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.750
 video 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 even if it gives nothing at least you have 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.419
 the technique is enough of two cases this is the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.519
 pea with ruins of mag 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.650
 after as I told you that remains of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.440
 the chance to pass the pn and I i 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.870
 not had this chance 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.250
 oh as it's a short video going over 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.910
 a meter anyway but my next 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.810
 video it's going to be trying to exorcise 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.889
 a dice or pea ring 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.630
 i have some rough and viable for it 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.750
 was handled planned for the game the ring 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.240
 papn and if they have nothing else to say 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.070
 this is the big fail after there are some who 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.410
 have that me a chance that goes into 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.259
 a few streets one other no so 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.789
