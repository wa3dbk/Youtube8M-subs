00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.530 
how to do three easy wall breaches some
old<00:00:08.250> some<00:00:08.580> relatively<00:00:09.000> new<00:00:09.240> that's<00:00:09.389> why<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
old some relatively new that's why I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.299 
old some relatively new that's why I
like<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> shove<00:00:10.019> them<00:00:10.200> all<00:00:10.320> until<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:11.099> put

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
like to shove them all until I like put

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.160 
like to shove them all until I like put
like<00:00:11.340> three<00:00:11.730> into<00:00:11.910> one<00:00:11.940> video<00:00:12.210> try<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> shove

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
like three into one video try to shove

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.810 
like three into one video try to shove
them<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.410> together<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.309> don't<00:00:14.639> see<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
them all together so I don't see the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.340 
them all together so I don't see the
point<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> making<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.570> video<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:16.049> each<00:00:16.109> one

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
point of making one video for each one

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.510 
point of making one video for each one
then<00:00:16.500> you're<00:00:16.650> pretty<00:00:16.770> much<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
then you're pretty much just making a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.609 
then you're pretty much just making a
video<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> make<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> video<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:19.140> having<00:00:19.350> any

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
video to make a video and not having any

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.410 
video to make a video and not having any
fun<00:00:19.890> doing<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.939> one's<00:00:21.150> actually

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
fun doing it so this one's actually

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
fun doing it so this one's actually
fairly<00:00:21.689> simple<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> don't<00:00:22.380> even<00:00:22.529> need<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> car

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
fairly simple you don't even need a car

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.590 
fairly simple you don't even need a car
to<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.789> walk<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.449> but

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
to do it you can just walk into it but

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
to do it you can just walk into it but
let's<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.810> look<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> map<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> lot<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
let's just look on the map now a lot of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.650 
let's just look on the map now a lot of
people<00:00:26.430> should<00:00:26.760> know<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
people should know about this one this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
people should know about this one this
is<00:00:27.750> actually<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> first<00:00:28.500> breeches<00:00:29.250> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is actually one of the first breeches I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
is actually one of the first breeches I
ever<00:00:29.519> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.510> knew<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> should<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
ever pretty much knew because I should I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
ever pretty much knew because I should I
ran<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:32.579> accident<00:00:32.809> while

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
ran into this one by accident while

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
ran into this one by accident while
playing<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> GTA<00:00:34.860> campaign<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.700> uh<00:00:35.730> when

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
playing the GTA campaign with uh when

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.729 
playing the GTA campaign with uh when
you're<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.840> Franklin<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.410> whatever<00:00:37.620> in

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you're like with Franklin or whatever in

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
you're like with Franklin or whatever in
your<00:00:37.860> racing<00:00:38.280> Lamar<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.239> come<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> area

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
your racing Lamar you come to this area

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
your racing Lamar you come to this area
and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.350> accidentally<00:00:40.770> ran<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.730> so

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and I accidentally ran into this one so

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.610 
and I accidentally ran into this one so
I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.690> how<00:00:42.750> most<00:00:42.960> people<00:00:43.050> found<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I think that's how most people found it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.690 
I think that's how most people found it
but<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.829> gonna<00:00:43.920> come<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but you're gonna come on to you on this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
but you're gonna come on to you on this
map<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.450> come<00:00:45.600> over<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> red

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
map and you're come over to this red

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
map and you're come over to this red
building<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.190> right<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
building just gonna go right here and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
building just gonna go right here and
you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.210> right<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> wall

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you know go right into the wall

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.660 
you know go right into the wall
now<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> only<00:00:49.920> reason<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.250> doing<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
now the only reason I'm doing this is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
now the only reason I'm doing this is
because<00:00:50.789> some<00:00:51.090> people<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:51.449> still<00:00:51.809> don't

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
because some people actually still don't

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
because some people actually still don't
know<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.829> glitches<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.579> wall

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
know about these glitches and wall

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
know about these glitches and wall
breaches<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> can't<00:00:55.050> shoot<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
breaches so you can't shoot out of this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.209 
breaches so you can't shoot out of this
one<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:55.980> easily<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> very

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
one very easily but it's a very

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
one very easily but it's a very
relatively<00:01:00.000> old<00:01:00.239> glitch<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
relatively old glitch that a lot of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
relatively old glitch that a lot of
people<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.699> yeah

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
people know about and it's just yeah

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
everyone mostly go to in the whole

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
everyone mostly go to in the whole
entire<00:01:34.799> game<00:01:35.329> usually<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> front<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> five

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
entire game usually in front of the five

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.179

hundred<00:01:37.259> thousand<00:01:37.590> dollar<00:01:37.710> apartment<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
hundred thousand dollar apartment the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.230 
hundred thousand dollar apartment the
reason<00:01:38.430> why<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.970> lot<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
reason why I like this one a lot is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700 
reason why I like this one a lot is
because<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> can't<00:01:39.869> die<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> two

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
because one you can't die in it and two

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
because one you can't die in it and two
you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> kill<00:01:41.250> people<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you can kill people in it so all you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.700 
you can kill people in it so all you
have<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> literally<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.259> once<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.530> come

have to literally do is once you come

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.050 
have to literally do is once you come
out<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> $4,000<00:01:44.579> part<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.880> come<00:01:44.970> right
