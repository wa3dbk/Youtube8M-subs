00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Mr President, I already said that I am 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 not chronologically therefore comes now 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 once again the question of christoph 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.719
 kÃ¶ssler delivered many many with him 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 others finally catch up with rapid 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.699
 sports director of things instead of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.590
 clearly appealing to shelter 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.029
 they have it by the hour says it will 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
 give a sports director 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 is that then the one who is so to speak 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 a bit relieved that she is not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 non-stop to all questions 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.719
 so I have to go through to what extent 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.899
 to relieve such a measure that is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 I do not want to define it that way 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.190
 But the fact is that I believe that it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 a mistake was 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 than I was a half years with my 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 friends have decided in the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 Succession of the nail does not belong 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 sporting director to order 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 with friends you mean the presidency yes 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.070
 that 's what i'm doing the presidency 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.220
 I'm all friends 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.220
 so you have to if so then one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 situation crystallized out that 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 Something a mistake is also saying that is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.200
 a mistake i take that on me because 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 I did that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 but there you have to change and there it is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.340
 For me no, we ask who 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.549
 that also decided that we the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.110
 occupy position of sports director 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.720
 become 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 we will need a few weeks to do that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 because the personalities are yes 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.380
 not on the roadside 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 I have talked to my dog 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.899
 will get from each of the candidates the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.399
 interested are also my concept iwe 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.960
 show video presentation 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.270
 while at the interessantesten to also 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 Invite his personal hearing 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.689
 and I very much hope that we will be up to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.849
 christmas an appropriate solution 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.790
 that made a decision namely 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.170
 someone the player of sport 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.840
 area for planning for the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.709
 Strategy from the u6 to the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.540
 fighting team is responsible 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.700
 will be in the shortest time as 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.319
 correcting a not happy one 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.769
 Make a decision about the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.769
 go stage
