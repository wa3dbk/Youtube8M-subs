00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
ventis so in Wrangell today they're in a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.100 
ventis so in Wrangell today they're in a
truck<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.130> these<00:02:22.760> obviously<00:02:23.390> compared<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
truck so these obviously compared to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.729 
truck so these obviously compared to
like<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.500> neighbor<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:25.250> Paris<00:02:26.060> mayor<00:02:26.810> I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
I mean these have probably look the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.690 
I mean these have probably look the
worst<00:03:26.630> out<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:26.989> all<00:03:27.230> trucks<00:03:27.680> I've<00:03:28.040> ever<00:03:28.310> seen

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
