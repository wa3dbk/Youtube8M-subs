inside of them so one two and three and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
inside of them so one two and three and
four<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.870> you're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.710> one

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
then put a pressure plate now this right

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
then put a pressure plate now this right
here<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.460> basic<00:00:53.640> oh<00:00:54.210> my<00:00:54.449> gosh<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> giant

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
slab do not go near that pressure plate

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.880 
slab do not go near that pressure plate
what<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> doing

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.260 
is go two blocks away and break one two
three<00:01:21.770> four<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.220> put<00:01:23.520> pistons<00:01:24.000> inside

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
three four and then put pistons inside

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.490 
three four and then put pistons inside
of<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.689> well<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> basically<00:01:25.170> what

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
one two three break the two underneath

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
one two three break the two underneath
it<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.759> pressure<00:01:33.119> plate<00:01:33.329> now

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it and then put a pressure plate now

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
it and then put a pressure plate now
this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.380> entire<00:01:34.890> machine<00:01:35.520> made<00:01:35.790> right

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this is our entire machine made right

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
this is our entire machine made right
here<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> what's<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> allow

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
here and this is what's going to allow

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.359 
here and this is what's going to allow
us<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.630> music<00:01:40.110> discs<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
us to get music discs so for this we

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.429 
us to get music discs so for this we
need<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.820> skeleton<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.899> creeper<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
need a skeleton and a creeper and I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
need a skeleton and a creeper and I
highly<00:01:43.799> suggest<00:01:44.250> getting<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.909> skeleton

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
highly suggest getting the skeleton

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.639 
highly suggest getting the skeleton
first<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> won't<00:01:45.899> actually<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.290> de-spawn

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
first that won't actually just de-spawn

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.270 
first that won't actually just de-spawn
Wow

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Wow

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
Wow
I<00:01:47.310> highly<00:01:47.939> suggest<00:01:48.119> getting<00:01:48.570> these<00:01:48.840> skeleton

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I highly suggest getting these skeleton

getting<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> skeleton<00:02:27.540> first<00:02:27.750> now<00:02:28.620> we're

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
getting the skeleton first now we're

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.009 
getting the skeleton first now we're
gonna<00:02:28.950> need<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.459> go<00:02:29.640> grab<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.209> creeper<00:02:30.599> I'm

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
gonna need to go grab a creeper I'm

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.630 
gonna need to go grab a creeper I'm
assuming<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.500> spider<00:02:31.800> yep<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.340> gonna<00:02:32.430> come

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
assuming the spider yep it's gonna come

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.289 
assuming the spider yep it's gonna come
here<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.000> let's<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.209> ahead<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.450> kill<00:02:33.569> him<00:02:35.299> try

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
here so let's go ahead and kill him try

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.580 
here so let's go ahead and kill him try
not<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> get<00:02:36.660> too<00:02:36.720> far<00:02:36.989> away<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> skeleton

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
not to get too far away so the skeleton

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860 
not to get too far away so the skeleton
doesn't<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.400> spawn<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.970> then<00:02:39.450> we're<00:02:39.569> going<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
doesn't be spawn and then we're going to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 
doesn't be spawn and then we're going to
lure<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.650> creeper<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> other<00:02:41.430> side<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
lure the creeper to the other side so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.460 
lure the creeper to the other side so
basically<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.510> way<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:43.019> actually

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
basically the way that this actually

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.979 
basically the way that this actually
works<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:44.010> whenever<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.670> skeleton<00:02:45.450> kills<00:02:45.750> a

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
works is whenever a skeleton kills a

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.190 
works is whenever a skeleton kills a
creeper<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:47.130> drop<00:02:47.670> music<00:02:48.239> discs<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.019> what

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
creeper they drop music discs so what

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
creeper they drop music discs so what
we're<00:02:49.349> doing<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.799> essentially<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.760> is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
we're doing is essentially right here is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.430 
we're doing is essentially right here is
making<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.690> where<00:02:51.750> these<00:02:51.930> skeleton

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
making it to where these skeleton

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.069 
making it to where these skeleton
definitely<00:02:53.160> has<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.819> shoot<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.209> creeper<00:02:54.569> so

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
definitely has to shoot the creeper so

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.210 
definitely has to shoot the creeper so
then<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:55.410> you're<00:02:55.500> gonna<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.040> now

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
then what you're gonna want to do now

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.319 
then what you're gonna want to do now
that<00:02:56.250> they're<00:02:56.549> both<00:02:56.670> trapped<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> want<00:02:57.239> to

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
that they're both trapped you want to

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.210 
that they're both trapped you want to
get<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.780> close<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> creeper<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
get really close to the creeper but not

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.770 
get really close to the creeper but not
too<00:02:59.519> close<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.030> where<00:03:00.150> it'll<00:03:00.329> actually<00:03:00.450> blow

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
too close to where it'll actually blow

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.199 
too close to where it'll actually blow
oh<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:01.140> gosh<00:03:01.579> get<00:03:02.579> out<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.000> here<00:03:03.269> go<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:05.209> and

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
oh my gosh get out of here go and and

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.190 
oh my gosh get out of here go and and
then<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.200> soon<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:09.299> skeleton<00:03:09.930> kills

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
then as soon as the the skeleton kills

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
then as soon as the the skeleton kills
the<00:03:10.560> creeper<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.430> should<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> music<00:03:12.420> disc

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
