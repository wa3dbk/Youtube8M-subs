hi<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.530> Steve<00:00:01.860> Jones<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.370> I'm<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.580> to

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.889 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to
define<00:00:03.810> some<00:00:03.870> gearing<00:00:04.770> ratios<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.899> well

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
define some gearing ratios for you well

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.459 
define some gearing ratios for you well
first<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.500> all<00:00:07.620> let's<00:00:08.990> understand<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.170> gears

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
first of all let's understand what gears

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.120 
first of all let's understand what gears
are<00:00:10.849> this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> wheel<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> set

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
are this is a wheel and on it are a set

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
are this is a wheel and on it are a set
of<00:00:14.250> teeth<00:00:14.580> there<00:00:15.389> are<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> certain<00:00:15.839> number<00:00:15.990> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of teeth there are a certain number of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439 
of teeth there are a certain number of
teeth<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> case<00:00:17.100> there's<00:00:17.400> 8<00:00:17.640> teeth

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
teeth in this case there's 8 teeth

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.200 
teeth in this case there's 8 teeth
here's<00:00:19.080> another<00:00:19.230> smaller<00:00:19.740> wheel<00:00:20.039> 4<00:00:20.939> teeth

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
here's another smaller wheel 4 teeth

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.359 
here's another smaller wheel 4 teeth
each<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.769> an<00:00:23.010> axle<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.230> center<00:00:25.369> right

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
each is on an axle in the center right

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.670 
each is on an axle in the center right
allowing<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> rotate<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:28.470> rotating

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
allowing it to rotate we're rotating

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.269 
allowing it to rotate we're rotating
this<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.550> anti-clockwise<00:00:31.279> automatically

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this one anti-clockwise automatically

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.180 
this one anti-clockwise automatically
the<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.660> four<00:00:33.989> teeth<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the one with four teeth is going to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
the one with four teeth is going to
rotate<00:00:35.430> clockwise<00:00:36.920> now<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.239> rotate<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.079> one

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
rotate clockwise now if I rotate the one

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.110 
rotate clockwise now if I rotate the one
on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.860> Left<00:00:41.360> anti-clockwise<00:00:42.410> once<00:00:43.879> it's<00:00:44.879> got

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
on the Left anti-clockwise once it's got

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.619 
on the Left anti-clockwise once it's got
eight<00:00:45.420> teeth<00:00:45.950> each<00:00:46.950> tooth<00:00:47.489> engages<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
eight teeth each tooth engages with the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.200 
eight teeth each tooth engages with the
tooth<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> wheel<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.489> means<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
tooth on this wheel and this means that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
tooth on this wheel and this means that
although<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.680> rotates<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.969> once<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.860> I'll

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
although this rotates only once so I'll

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.060 
although this rotates only once so I'll
say<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.579> rotates<00:00:58.010> once<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.739> will<00:01:02.670> rotate

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
say it rotates once this one will rotate

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.350 
say it rotates once this one will rotate
actually<00:01:05.070> twice<00:01:07.280> now<00:01:08.280> normally<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.150> we're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
actually twice now normally when we're

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
actually twice now normally when we're
defining<00:01:09.750> ratios<00:01:11.150> we<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.409> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
defining ratios we put it down as say we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.560 
defining ratios we put it down as say we
can<00:01:14.130> say<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> ratio<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> eight<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.409> four

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
can say the ratio here is eight to four

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.380 
can say the ratio here is eight to four
but<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.720> course<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> simplify<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
but of course we can simplify that and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
but of course we can simplify that and
in<00:01:22.020> fact<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.650> ratio<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.659> two<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:26.689> we<00:01:27.689> would

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
in fact the ratio is two to one we would

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
in fact the ratio is two to one we would
say<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.240> drive<00:01:31.490> we'll<00:01:32.490> call

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
say that if this is the drive we'll call

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
say that if this is the drive we'll call
this<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> drive<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
this one the drive and this is the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.140 
this one the drive and this is the
driven<00:01:36.420> gear<00:01:37.820> then<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:39.180> we've<00:01:39.420> got<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
driven gear then what we've got is a

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:51.980 
driven gear then what we've got is a
gearing<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:47.540> two<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:50.210> however<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.630> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
gearing up of two to one however if this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.010 
gearing up of two to one however if this
was<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> drive<00:01:53.220> gear<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
was the drive gear if this was the one I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
was the drive gear if this was the one I
was<00:01:55.380> turning<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.420> will<00:01:57.420> find<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.610> one

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
was turning I will find that this one

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.490 
was turning I will find that this one
will<00:02:00.180> turn<00:02:00.420> slower<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.579> say<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
will turn slower and then I would say a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.210 
will turn slower and then I would say a
gearing<00:02:04.500> down<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:07.369> two<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.979> get

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
gearing down of two to one so don't get

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.020 
gearing down of two to one so don't get
confused

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
confused

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
confused
we<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> gear<00:02:12.900> up

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we are the gear up

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.030 
we are the gear up
or<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:13.800> gear<00:02:14.070> down<00:02:15.110> whatever<00:02:16.110> happens<00:02:16.740> it's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
or we gear down whatever happens it's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
or we gear down whatever happens it's
the<00:02:17.220> number<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.820> teeth<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> wheel<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the number of teeth on the wheel that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.550 
the number of teeth on the wheel that
tells<00:02:19.650> me<00:02:19.950> how<00:02:20.550> fast<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.600> wheel<00:02:21.960> will<00:02:22.320> go

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
tells me how fast one wheel will go

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.460 
tells me how fast one wheel will go
compared<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.490> other<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.570> very<00:02:24.930> simple

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
compared to the other it's very simple

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.910 
compared to the other it's very simple
keep<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.430> simple
