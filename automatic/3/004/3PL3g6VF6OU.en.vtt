00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.080
 because most students could process and four children width of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.870
 a product has the first trailer to varying degrees also here 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.859
 change the new species 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.309
 and the good shelf life 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.759
 special to proper care without the lady being cut off now 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.349
 chance that nice open 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.180
 and I have good reason without first processing 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.519
 the first broken 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.859
 I'm going to make something today with reading for the theme of salvation 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.880
 and I decided something makes me simple with a few days later boss a few 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.899
 birch branches 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.100
 and then a beautiful nothing 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.560
 It is very simple and last but not least to fit KEMA tape to KEMA 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.340
 goals 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.829
 and therefore that the higher packages 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 in my case the pottery working 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.020
 because the water level to enter to the boss nac 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 when it comes to the bottom it often also with a second 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 cupboard 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.740
 so the whole out yes quite tight 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.110
 stays around the boss 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.500
 I chose the dry birch because it is a fairly playful task 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.460
 it is no longer there 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
 yes the transparent mt 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.310
 do not make love a golden grasp certain opportunity 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.820
 but then my life will be a wonderful hour 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.800
 come in 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.270
 I think something important for the florist was this in a kind of series 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 make the horrors of making these objects that people think put it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 I think a little bit is lost and also complaining the working time is more convenient 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.930
 to make it more equal 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.740
 are also often left a little longer at the bottom 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.160
 have you just on 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.670
 that's called that 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 and now of course I wish my epd had been hidden 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.410
 and that I am a bit sorry for this 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.860
 swollen like 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.119
 the reason language chosen because there is also a bit that cures 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.720
 end would be a disaster 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 has shown old radiation that I say with my products 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.890
 and so I can easily paste that month 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 would hide under it 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.219
 I've had a few hedges before 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.639
 the striker himself also prepared the idea 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.769
 and meetings in two colors 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.399
 finishing the beautiful green 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.899
 and a bitter one 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.539
 have a basis 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.639
 what I think would be the two suspects that this is an important one 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.279
 step into this 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.059
 and green 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.439
 for it of course 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.459
 sauber it tens 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.640
 and with that beautiful natural look 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.919
 but we got a few more back if I could do his city group 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 be in store 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.879
 I want to read the different games I have here for a long time 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.979
 many beautiful times oriente 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.139
 it offers cia has this mess 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.049
 the beautiful Kurzaal euro flowers 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.359
 I find it important to reduce the leaves a little bit 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.379
 that it is on the blisters to the things that stay put I actually think it is one 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.619
 some or other highlight also derived from the flower days 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:19.799
 and because I am approaching both cities wrong at the flower buds 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.869
 Yes 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.329
 slightly tighter 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.329
 clear line 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.719
 I can put this in between with heels, so the lady's also share one 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.459
 supported 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.789
 I'm going to add a little bit of this for free that never comes in that color 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.539
 the ribbon 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:39.789
 and palestines 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:43.169
 so also tasting this picks up and in May a flower arrangement says mesh 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.319
 intrigues 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.459
 I have still there because it has not completely changed 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.149
 because the province that different species live it is very beautiful 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.059
 in these last flavors 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 and that hereby land tries to place her something 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.259
 reduce trudy beautiful trumpet-shaped bud and flower 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.009
 get enough attention 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.059
 thank you a little bit of gas soon 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.469
 keep working in this case I approve green gas 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 and then we ran a little green ago 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.319
 and and no 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.499
 so the rotating different 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.330
 lady type 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.599
 and this is that is sensitive some green I am okay actually very beautiful them 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.389
 would be colored 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.389
 that can play nicely in this combination 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.349
 it again 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 first time robie rutte all 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:04.879
 still here 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.210
 year updates but that's good 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.599
 then goes by 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.150
 it is important that we are sufficient 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
 caregiver more benefits 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.960
 I also think that presentation is complete 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.240
 four beautiful eijk heads up for the window form later in the store 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.849
 titus hopefully brings the lily to the extra attention
