of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.349> enemies<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
of the enemies and then make a very of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.199 
of the enemies and then make a very of
effect<00:02:19.260> type<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.769> thing<00:02:19.950> where<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.760> blows<00:02:21.000> of

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
effect type of thing where it blows of

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.500 
effect type of thing where it blows of
all<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> other<00:02:21.720> enemies<00:02:22.350> around<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:24.060> enemy

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
all the other enemies around that enemy

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.270 
all the other enemies around that enemy
so<00:02:24.720> that'd<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.019> pretty<00:02:25.200> cool<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.069> well

so that'd be pretty cool to have as well

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.440 
so that'd be pretty cool to have as well

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
are concerns and curiosities that I have

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.219 
are concerns and curiosities that I have
for<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.070> character<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.610> one<00:04:29.540> thing<00:04:30.140> I'm

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
for the character of one thing I'm

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.670 
for the character of one thing I'm
hoping<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.620> agent<00:04:31.160> do<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
hoping that agent do is for the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.219 
hoping that agent do is for the
animation<00:04:34.370> when<00:04:34.580> he<00:04:34.700> shoots<00:04:35.330> his<00:04:35.600> arrows<00:04:36.020> I

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
animation when he shoots his arrows I

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.070 
animation when he shoots his arrows I
really<00:04:36.500> hope<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.950> they<00:04:37.669> show<00:04:38.330> actually<00:04:38.870> show

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
really hope that they show actually show

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.930 
really hope that they show actually show
him<00:04:39.380> like<00:04:39.680> blowing<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.220> arrows<00:04:40.610> from<00:04:40.760> this

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
him like blowing the arrows from this

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.400 
him like blowing the arrows from this
quiver<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.390> know<00:04:41.540> just<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.870> add<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:41.990> little<00:04:42.110> bit

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
quiver you know just to add a little bit

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.390 
quiver you know just to add a little bit
of<00:04:43.510> realization<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.810> game<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:46.220> would<00:04:46.310> be

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
of realization to the game that would be

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.040 
of realization to the game that would be
really<00:04:46.580> awesome<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.060> happens<00:04:47.570> I've<00:04:47.720> noticed

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
really awesome to happens I've noticed

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.140 
really awesome to happens I've noticed
that<00:04:48.200> they<00:04:48.320> don't<00:04:48.500> really<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:48.950> kind<00:04:49.940> of

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
that they don't really have that kind of

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.340 
that they don't really have that kind of
it's<00:04:50.270> kind<00:04:50.510> of<00:04:50.600> weird<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.020> know<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.169> don't

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
it's kind of weird you know I don't

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.010 
it's kind of weird you know I don't
really<00:04:51.560> like<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:52.039> when<00:04:52.190> games<00:04:52.490> have<00:04:52.760> that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
really like it when games have that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.239 
really like it when games have that
let's<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.350> know<00:04:54.500> unrealistic

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249 
let's see you know unrealistic

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.599 
let's see you know unrealistic
looks<00:04:56.969> really<00:04:57.239> weird<00:04:57.419> uh<00:04:57.919> but<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:58.979> hope<00:04:59.249> that<00:04:59.339> he

00:04:59.599 --> 00:04:59.609 
looks really weird uh but I hope that he

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:03.769 
looks really weird uh but I hope that he
can<00:05:01.069> do<00:05:02.069> that<00:05:02.279> now<00:05:02.519> because<00:05:02.759> I<00:05:03.089> have<00:05:03.359> I<00:05:03.569> did

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
can do that now because I have I did

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.629 
can do that now because I have I did
tell<00:05:04.259> them<00:05:04.379> about<00:05:04.529> it<00:05:04.799> a<00:05:04.859> while<00:05:05.039> back<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.579> I

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
tell them about it a while back and I

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.179 
tell them about it a while back and I
hope<00:05:05.789> they<00:05:05.879> listen<00:05:06.179> to<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.569> idea<00:05:06.899> about<00:05:07.859> that

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
hope they listen to the idea about that

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.079 
hope they listen to the idea about that
and<00:05:08.399> uh<00:05:08.599> put<00:05:09.599> that<00:05:09.779> in<00:05:09.899> the<00:05:10.019> game<00:05:10.199> so<00:05:11.059> hope<00:05:12.059> they

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:12.089 
and uh put that in the game so hope they

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.179 
and uh put that in the game so hope they
change<00:05:12.569> that<00:05:12.869> animation<00:05:13.289> that<00:05:13.769> I'm<00:05:13.979> pretty

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
change that animation that I'm pretty

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.569 
change that animation that I'm pretty
sure<00:05:14.279> is<00:05:14.369> not<00:05:14.669> that<00:05:14.849> hard<00:05:15.739> well<00:05:16.739> it's<00:05:17.219> just<00:05:17.399> me

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:17.579 
sure is not that hard well it's just me

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:18.679 
sure is not that hard well it's just me
I<00:05:17.609> don't<00:05:17.939> really<00:05:18.029> know<00:05:18.269> anything<00:05:18.299> about

I don't really know anything about

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.539 
I don't really know anything about
programming<00:05:19.319> but<00:05:19.679> I<00:05:19.709> hope<00:05:20.039> it<00:05:20.219> isn't<00:05:20.519> that

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:20.549 
programming but I hope it isn't that

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:23.419 
programming but I hope it isn't that
hard<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.269> they<00:05:21.419> can<00:05:21.779> actually<00:05:22.249> you<00:05:23.249> don't

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:23.429 
hard that they can actually you don't

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:27.649 
hard that they can actually you don't
want<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:23.909> change<00:05:24.119> that<00:05:24.589> um<00:05:25.939> that's<00:05:26.939> really<00:05:27.029> hit
