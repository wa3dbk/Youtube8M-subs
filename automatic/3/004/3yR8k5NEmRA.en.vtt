glow around the edge of the screen and
it's<00:00:12.960> visible<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.650> edges<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:15.299> told

a<00:00:17.930> manufacturing<00:00:18.930> flaw<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.949> wanted

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
a manufacturing flaw and I just wanted

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.920 
a manufacturing flaw and I just wanted
to<00:00:20.250> bring<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.789> light<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.180> case<00:00:21.420> anybody

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

else<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.320> wondering<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.400> or

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
else was wondering what this was or

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
else was wondering what this was or
maybe<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.810> haven't<00:00:25.080> seen<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> yet<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.650> just

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
maybe if you haven't seen it yet I just

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
maybe if you haven't seen it yet I just
wanted<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> put<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.849> make<00:00:26.910> sure

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
wanted to put it out there and make sure

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
wanted to put it out there and make sure
that<00:00:27.630> everybody<00:00:28.140> knew<00:00:28.349> exactly<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.980> was

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that everybody knew exactly what was

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.999 
that everybody knew exactly what was
going<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.119> there's<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.810> bluish<00:00:31.230> purplish

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
going on so there's this bluish purplish

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
going on so there's this bluish purplish
glow<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.730> said<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
glow like I said and you can see it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
glow like I said and you can see it
pretty<00:00:34.469> much<00:00:34.770> anywhere<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.940> especially

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
pretty much anywhere it's especially

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.530 
pretty much anywhere it's especially
distracting<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.649> white<00:00:38.579> backgrounds<00:00:39.390> or

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
distracting on white backgrounds or

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
distracting on white backgrounds or
lighter<00:00:40.050> color<00:00:40.440> backgrounds<00:00:41.160> where<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> can

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
lighter color backgrounds where you can

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.470 
lighter color backgrounds where you can
definitely<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> contrast<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
definitely see that contrast but this is

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
definitely see that contrast but this is
probably<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> manufacturing<00:00:46.500> issue<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
probably a manufacturing issue I'm not

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
probably a manufacturing issue I'm not
exactly<00:00:47.700> sure<00:00:47.879> cuz<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.300> work<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.690> Amazon

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
exactly sure cuz I don't work at Amazon

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160 
exactly sure cuz I don't work at Amazon
but<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.980> assume<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.510> problem<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:52.050> be

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
but I assume that the problem will be

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
but I assume that the problem will be
corrected<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.520> along

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
corrected as you can see here it's along

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.430 
corrected as you can see here it's along
the<00:00:53.969> long<00:00:54.180> edge<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.079> slight

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the long edge there it's just a slight

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
the long edge there it's just a slight
gradient<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:56.879> noticed<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
gradient when I first noticed this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
gradient when I first noticed this
actually<00:00:57.719> went<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.649> Best<00:00:58.859> Buy<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
actually went back to Best Buy and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.420 
actually went back to Best Buy and
exchanged<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.500> saw<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.800> again<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.340> then

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
exchanged it and I saw it again and then

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
exchanged it and I saw it again and then
I<00:01:02.520> exchanged<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> again<00:01:03.480> shot<00:01:04.019> again<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
I exchanged it again shot again and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
I exchanged it again shot again and
exchanged<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.400> time<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> still<00:01:06.450> saw

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
exchanged it one more time and still saw

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.950 
exchanged it one more time and still saw
the<00:01:06.780> same<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:08.159> bluish<00:01:08.790> purple<00:01:09.390> glow<00:01:09.750> right

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the same little bluish purple glow right

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
the same little bluish purple glow right
here<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> edge<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.950> after<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.670> determined

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
here on the edge but after we determined

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
here on the edge but after we determined
that<00:01:12.299> most<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> best<00:01:13.110> buying<00:01:13.350> units<00:01:13.560> had

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that most of the best buying units had

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
that most of the best buying units had
this<00:01:14.250> same<00:01:14.580> issue

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this same issue

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
this same issue
I<00:01:15.600> contacted<00:01:16.110> Amazon<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:16.920> said<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I contacted Amazon and they said that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770 
I contacted Amazon and they said that
they<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.549> continue<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.090> replace<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
they will continue to replace this

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
they will continue to replace this
device<00:01:19.170> until<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.369> without<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
device until I get one without the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
device until I get one without the
problem<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:22.049> assuming<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
problem so I'm assuming that this is a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.520 
problem so I'm assuming that this is a
manufacturing<00:01:23.850> issue<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.450> who<00:01:24.869> knows<00:01:25.110> what

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
manufacturing issue but who knows what

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
manufacturing issue but who knows what
it<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> why<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.369> happening<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:26.909> hope

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it is and why it's happening I just hope

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.670 
it is and why it's happening I just hope
they<00:01:27.390> correct<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.140> soon<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> future

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
they correct it very soon in the future

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
they correct it very soon in the future
so<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:29.970> people<00:01:30.270> aren't<00:01:30.689> stuck
