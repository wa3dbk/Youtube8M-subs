00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.230
 someone was going to throw it out 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.370
 I think it's some kind of antiques are not 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.400
 only for a tie 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.090
 wait for 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.489

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.450

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.170

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.519
