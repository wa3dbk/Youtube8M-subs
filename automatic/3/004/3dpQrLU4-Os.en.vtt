00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.460 

they<00:01:10.620> wouldn't<00:01:10.920> stay<00:01:11.160> by<00:01:11.460> themselves<00:01:11.910> so<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
they wouldn't stay by themselves so I

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000 
they wouldn't stay by themselves so I
used<00:01:13.470> twisty<00:01:14.010> ties<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.490> hair<00:01:15.300> ties<00:01:15.540> um<00:01:16.010> so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
used twisty ties or hair ties um so

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.650 
used twisty ties or hair ties um so
let's<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.760> comes<00:01:17.940> out<00:01:18.180> I've<00:01:18.480> never

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
let's see how it comes out I've never

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.480 
let's see how it comes out I've never
done<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.470> alright<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
done this it's the first one alright so

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
done this it's the first one alright so
I'm<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.730> to<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:23.910> these<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.460> let's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
I'm going to take these out and let's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:03:47.210 
I'm going to take these out and let's
speed<00:01:26.880> up

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180 

okay<00:03:48.090> um<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.990> guess<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.890> finished

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
okay um I guess this is the finished

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.420 
okay um I guess this is the finished
look<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:52.110> might<00:03:52.350> flip<00:03:52.710> it<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.010> little<00:03:53.220> bit

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
look and I might flip it a little bit

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.990 
look and I might flip it a little bit
more<00:03:53.610> before<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.510> was<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> house<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:56.220> this

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
more before I was the house but this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.660 
more before I was the house but this
pretty<00:03:57.240> much<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.770> as<00:03:58.770> you<00:03:58.860> can<00:03:58.980> see<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.550> was

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
pretty much it as you can see as I was

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.080 
pretty much it as you can see as I was
going<00:03:59.820> through<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.660> was<00:04:01.650> separating<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.850> knots

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
going through I was separating the knots

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.520 
going through I was separating the knots
and<00:04:03.600> then<00:04:04.440> fluffing<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.220> lot<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:05.730> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
and then fluffing it a lot because I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.000 
and then fluffing it a lot because I
don't<00:04:07.530> want<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.090> look<00:04:09.240> too<00:04:09.710> done<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.950> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
don't want it to look too done and I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.539 
don't want it to look too done and I
want<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.460> big<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:14.870> think<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.019> looks<00:04:16.170> good

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
want it to be big I think it looks good

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.170 
want it to be big I think it looks good
right<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.850> don't<00:04:18.329> know<00:04:19.790> um<00:04:22.130> anyway<00:04:23.130> alright<00:04:23.970> so

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
right I don't know um anyway alright so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:37.510 
right I don't know um anyway alright so
here<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.480> is

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.570 

uh<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:38.680> think<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:39.770> pretty<00:04:39.919> good<00:04:40.069> for<00:04:40.129> my<00:04:40.280> first

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
uh I think it's pretty good for my first

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.820 
uh I think it's pretty good for my first
try<00:04:40.789> but<00:04:41.660> I'm<00:04:41.960> probably<00:04:42.289> going<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:44.560> redo<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830
