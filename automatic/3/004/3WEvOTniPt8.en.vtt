00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 new episode of no limits 2 and this 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 arrived on episode 87 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 it goes so quickly 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 and I'm going to a level in the folder tje 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 we chose to play one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 oh i know they are three again 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.039
 roller coasters in a folder 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 that's why i put it in a yes you go it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.320
 steinel and see in it did the stijn 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 Link and city dweller is an amusement park that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.019
 who has made with his middle here 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.670
 in the park and we are here at the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.260
 first roller coaster arrived I think 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.850
 I just this one right I do 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 mean he leaves just that you see 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.840
 always a new one too 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 nicely timed again nicely timed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.710
 let's do this first i repeat the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.030
 We striker and we are here at the cost 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 the typhoon 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 so that is the very first one already sees quite 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 great I see station 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 and then it has thought of the environment 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.280
 so it's just a complete park that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 we are going to visit the so tumble 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 it is called a little based on the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.609
 I think efteling and there we go 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 leave from the station with this 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.390
 separate carts 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is very strange how you how i can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 are made but it is of course one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.170
 chose launch as we see that is not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.310
 to miss 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 and we go with a really different one 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.450
 speed of 95 km 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.460
 shot 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.689
 he actually did not go fast than 95 me 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.640
 I think that's a bit the maximum 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.670
 set up this roller coaster just like that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.619
 exciting as possible and not so 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.549
 hurry 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 well looks nice loops already 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.509
 nice curves nice support very 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.030
 well done very cool done the colors 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 red nice a bit mixed gray and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.520
 I see red 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.040
 He also let it come back in the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 carts now a corkscrew and we 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 get a piece here and share him 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.610
 that was the roller coaster again that was real 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 a very fast ride actually we are there 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.119
 so quickly through in the typhoon but 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.890
 I think this is just a roller coaster 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 where you just your hair just nice 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 and can throw a red tasty 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.829
 can relax from this ride i think 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
 this such a roller coaster is that that 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.740
 I almost certainly know the typhoon 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 t2c an s2 it's just that you get it 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.320
 write in the dust write in you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.790
 notebook 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 may also come coordinate i know 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.239
 not exactly what it means 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 raid i actually have to go through the exit 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.050
 the out so I can actually through this 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.310
 but we just do it 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 yolo and we go to the next one 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.610
 roller coaster so he has three roller coasters 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 made in a park called styling and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.540
 should this be the python no 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.370
 I just a looping 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.960
 and it doesn't look but I think so 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.880
 it is nice to have a look at it has grass 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.870
 used instead of that high hedge 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.340
 then finds a very big one anyway 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.080
 plus because you always have those hedges 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.570
 along those sides and it too 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.370
 use of trees in between and from 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.440
 lamp-posts which fit nicely here 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.820
 or tick separately only those that were there 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.710
 not anymore 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.900
 I see my green roller coaster and one 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.810
 let the blue save the blue for it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.460
 recently had all these green ones and this one 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.430
 roller coaster is called the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.290
 Snake or the snake and looks one 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
 like a fairground idea 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.130
 but really another roller coaster where I 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.020
 fall in love with you know that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.830
 little off jobs that interest me 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.480
 most 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.820
 because they are very cute and compact 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.130
 made in the I love forever now we 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360
 leave and he is not so 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.680
 high as you see it is really one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.420
 bit a child once the coast 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.310
 I think so too 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.080
 supports themselves are nice 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.489
 but we really do that at the fair 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.110
 think that until now 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.000
 yes and you know that really a blue you know 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.440
 well and that it also come back in the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.630
 I think there are carts at the last one 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.850
 choice is also going to happen and I think 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.230
 a maximum speed of 39 km whether it is 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.239
 even more 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.320
 who has who is like 44km that they are on 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.530
 pretty fast for that once 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.970
 coaster also has a nice trip 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.470
 last turn 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.560
 well just a simple suspicious you there 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.300
 yet with an average of 40 km hours it is 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.860
 drop rollercoaster 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.050
 nice support by the way again 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.300
 again nice support nicely done 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.250
 nice carts nice system I thought 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.380
 this also super nice I am satisfied 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.260
 about what has been deposited in so far 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.440
 in the park and very original and unique 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.730
 and I thought this was super fun though 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.170
 yes the opinions always differ 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.489
 also know in the comments which you 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.050
 the most fun, but I was going to leave 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.300
 because we still have a roller coaster 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.950
 let 's get out of the cart 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.540
 I'll go to the right place this time 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.290
 get off the and the I already stood here so 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.620
 per party or was I oh oh I was 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.320
 got in wrong 10 you were just here 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.820
 underneath o but that grass could even go on 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.590
 the stairs by question by well here eh even 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.120
 look at what we would last here 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.639
 roller coaster 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.979
 That's the until it's a cracking whole 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.240
 quite nice that roller coaster names and 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.280
 here is also ready for me 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.160
 is that i could just do any entry whenever 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.380
 I want to sit in the back again even though I am 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.410
 take it late no no no come in 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.630
 knock no no no I have to wait for the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.000
 I'm in no now I really have to wait 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.160
 until the next oh my god i want 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.050
 just me in the back and there we go 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.130
 then in the dragon is whole and I think 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.630
 this is the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.460
 yes maybe this will soon be me too 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.449
 am a teacher who then sets the first 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.770
 coaster 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.280
 but here he looks very cool 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.930
 Well check out very nicely built and supple 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 then I also think about a big one 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.440
 part of the terrain and this 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.660
 will also be the last eight people we 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.220
 we do with the 12 km hours 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.139
 launched and I think this is almost too 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.479
 the highest roller coaster is of the park as 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.789
 I see it so think he comes in 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.990
 my eyes higher than the red roller coasters me 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.960
 don't know for sure because it is usually 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.100
 a kind of illusion because then you think 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.780
 van is the hearing but the see in the 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.550
 wooden roller coaster and then you see oh no 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.130
 this does not come close to this 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.330
 height of this roller coaster raid we go 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.130
 get the first drop and then get it 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.500
 the first looping we were really cool about one 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.410
 time back 8 months they are already a 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.210
 kind of a kind of python idea 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.979
 maybe if your terol 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.650
 yes maybe have to look very often 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.729
 maybe to you it is nice to 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.760
 to sit in the back once 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.039
 he is not really super fast but the 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.330
 have a fair momentum in and out 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.070
 that it is also very important because they 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.289
 on average 50 times pure 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.520
 a reasonable speed 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.440
 every fall it is not the fastest 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.030
 roller coaster of the park and again not 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.419
 a very super long roller coaster because me 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.770
 Well in the beginning I thought it would be 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.139
 just three actually three small ones 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.639
 compact roller coasters and yes that is 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.860
 also nice and he finally has it 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.419
 also has not used yellow and that 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.949
 has not been in the supports or or 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.539
 used the job but only for this 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.240
 the carts that is cool to share 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.800
 did and after I just find it 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.050
 very cool park it just looks very good 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.849
 out all of them and leave again 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.830
 fly over everything to see what we 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.479
 now we have done the the the 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.699
 a whole track was very blue 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.380
 and we always done this 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.970
 snow that is that little fair day warm 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.860
 and have called the red 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.349
 and that was just thinking but what if one 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.390
 I just secretly go typhoon 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.340
 I think I am the typhoon 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.740
 I think that's the coolest roller coaster 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.110
 of everything because you and me 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.400
 went fastest and also a very long one 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.260
 layout 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.390
 speak with the other roller coasters also 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.290
 the blue as well as quite large and cool 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.460
 done 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.080
 so such a difficult choice
