all right we're over at cycling concepts

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.980 
all right we're over at cycling concepts
we<00:00:07.580> just<00:00:07.730> finished<00:00:07.970> up<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.120> menorah<00:00:08.510> review

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
and now we're going to go over the nuts

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.660 
and now we're going to go over the nuts
and<00:00:10.129> bolts<00:00:10.309> literally<00:00:11.150> of<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.960> kinetic<00:00:12.670> road

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
and bolts literally of the kinetic road

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.299 
and bolts literally of the kinetic road
machine<00:00:14.300> now<00:00:15.259> I<00:00:15.290> think<00:00:15.590> many<00:00:15.830> of<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.099> that<00:00:16.189> are

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
machine now I think many of you that are

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.339 
machine now I think many of you that are
in<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.430> club<00:00:16.670> a<00:00:16.700> price<00:00:16.939> seen<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.300> review<00:00:17.840> on<00:00:18.170> the

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
in the club a price seen a review on the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.580 
in the club a price seen a review on the
road<00:00:19.160> machine<00:00:19.340> by<00:00:19.730> Josh<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.570> Dave<00:00:21.260> one<00:00:21.410> heavy

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
road machine by Josh and Dave one heavy

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.040 
road machine by Josh and Dave one heavy
stop<00:00:21.859> peddling<00:00:22.130> just<00:00:22.279> for<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.460> second<00:00:23.050> now

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
stop peddling just for a second now

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.320 
stop peddling just for a second now
right<00:00:24.230> away<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:25.039> first<00:00:25.070> thing<00:00:25.369> I<00:00:25.580> noted<00:00:25.970> just

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
right away the first thing I noted just

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.880 
right away the first thing I noted just
looking<00:00:26.660> at<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.840> machine<00:00:27.199> is<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.740> much

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
looking at the machine is it's a much

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.920 
looking at the machine is it's a much
heavier<00:00:28.369> machine<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.210> little<00:00:29.330> bit<00:00:29.539> more<00:00:29.720> beef

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
heavier machine a little bit more beef

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.200 
heavier machine a little bit more beef
so<00:00:30.349> right<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.680> hear<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.010> two<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.279> joints<00:00:31.640> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
so right you hear the two the joints the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.360 
so right you hear the two the joints the
choices<00:00:32.660> how<00:00:33.590> this<00:00:33.739> opens<00:00:33.890> up<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.309> little

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
choices how this opens up is a little

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.180 
choices how this opens up is a little
bit<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.120> know<00:00:35.210> less<00:00:35.420> steep<00:00:35.719> angle<00:00:36.190> typically

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
bit you know less steep angle typically

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.870 
bit you know less steep angle typically
meaning<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:37.550> going<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.760> have<00:00:37.850> more

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
meaning it's going to have more

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.569 
meaning it's going to have more
stability<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:39.110> little<00:00:39.559> bit<00:00:39.649> more<00:00:39.770> quality<00:00:40.250> here

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
stability a little bit more quality here

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.600 
stability a little bit more quality here
in<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.770> little<00:00:42.770> nipples<00:00:43.100> that<00:00:43.280> kind<00:00:43.550> of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
in the little nipples that kind of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.790 
in the little nipples that kind of
adjacent<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.480> floor<00:00:44.780> obviously<00:00:45.379> a

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
adjacent to the floor obviously a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.440 
adjacent to the floor obviously a
different<00:00:46.309> flywheel<00:00:46.910> set<00:00:47.120> up<00:00:47.180> which<00:00:47.270> I<00:00:47.329> want

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
different flywheel set up which I want

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.330 
different flywheel set up which I want
to<00:00:47.510> let<00:00:47.629> Dave<00:00:47.870> here<00:00:48.140> explain<00:00:48.559> in<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.800> second

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
to let Dave here explain in a second

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.049 
to let Dave here explain in a second
I<00:00:49.370> was<00:00:50.030> watching<00:00:50.390> Dave<00:00:50.600> put<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:51.940> put<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
I was watching Dave put this put the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.700 
I was watching Dave put this put the
bike<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.840> system<00:00:54.230> again<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.530> want

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
bike in the system again you want

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.750 
bike in the system again you want
something<00:00:54.890> that's<00:00:55.010> really<00:00:55.370> well<00:00:55.550> put

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
something that's really well put

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
is with that again typically if it's

been<00:01:48.439> able<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.680> find<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.560> how<00:01:51.560> heavy<00:01:51.740> is

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
been able to find so it's how heavy is

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.319 
been able to find so it's how heavy is
the<00:01:51.950> flywheel<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:52.670> six<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.180> quarter

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
the flywheel here it's six and a quarter

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.770 
the flywheel here it's six and a quarter
pounds<00:01:53.630> okay<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:54.820> this<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:56.060> fluid<00:01:56.509> yes

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
pounds okay and then this is fluid yes

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.740 
pounds okay and then this is fluid yes
yep<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.500> uses<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.829> synthetic<00:01:58.540> fluid<00:01:59.540> that's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
yep it uses a synthetic fluid that's

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.810 
yep it uses a synthetic fluid that's
resistant<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.409> heat<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.369> going<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.549> stay

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
resistant to heat so it's going to stay

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.700 
resistant to heat so it's going to stay
very<00:02:02.240> consistent<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> harder<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.530> you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
very consistent the harder that you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.310 
very consistent the harder that you
pedal<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.700> more<00:02:05.060> resistance<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:05.869> model<00:02:06.259> is

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
pedal the more resistance this model is

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.499 
pedal the more resistance this model is
going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.560> create<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:07.430> unlike<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.969> minora<00:02:08.329> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
going to create now unlike the minora I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.240 
going to create now unlike the minora I
don't<00:02:08.690> see<00:02:08.899> anything<00:02:09.079> connected<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.100> so

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
don't see anything connected to this so

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.559 
don't see anything connected to this so
there's<00:02:10.429> nothing<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.850> comes<00:02:11.090> up<00:02:11.299> here<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
there's nothing that comes up here and

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.780 
there's nothing that comes up here and
attaches<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.230> handlebar<00:02:12.739> right<00:02:12.980> yep<00:02:13.489> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
attaches to the handlebar right yep that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.640 
attaches to the handlebar right yep that
in<00:02:13.970> essence<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.450> beauty<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.930> this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
in essence is the beauty of this

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.280 
in essence is the beauty of this
of<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:16.010> fluid<00:02:16.489> resistance<00:02:17.060> unit<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.569> it's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
of the fluid resistance unit is it's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.190 
of the fluid resistance unit is it's
really<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.860> put<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> bike<00:02:19.939> on<00:02:20.200> start

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
really just put the bike on start

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.899 
really just put the bike on start
working<00:02:21.560> out<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.189> simple<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.700> you

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
working out it's as simple as that you

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.339 
working out it's as simple as that you
don't<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.269> anything<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.780> work<00:02:23.959> with<00:02:23.989> of

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
don't have anything to work with of

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.210 
don't have anything to work with of
cables<00:02:24.739> or<00:02:24.860> anything

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
cables or anything

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.309

so unlike the menorah or unlike a

device<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.400> nonlinear<00:02:32.180> its

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
device this one is nonlinear its

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.690 
device this one is nonlinear its
progressive<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.620> know<00:02:33.680> absolutely<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.549> what

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
progressive you know absolutely and what

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.399 
progressive you know absolutely and what
does<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.819> mean<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.750> everyday<00:02:35.930> cyclist

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
does that mean for the everyday cyclist

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.259 
does that mean for the everyday cyclist
using<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:37.400> means<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.849> as<00:02:38.030> you're<00:02:38.239> going

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
using that means that as you're going

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.240 
using that means that as you're going
through<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:38.810> workouts<00:02:39.349> or<00:02:39.590> even<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.099> an

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
through your workouts or even just an

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.880 
through your workouts or even just an
aerobic<00:02:40.909> ride<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.170> feel<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.379> lot

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
aerobic ride it's going to feel a lot

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.589 
aerobic ride it's going to feel a lot
more<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.489> you're<00:02:43.640> actually<00:02:44.030> riding<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
more like you're actually riding the

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.420 
more like you're actually riding the
bike<00:02:44.780> on<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.170> road<00:02:45.319> outside<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.189> when<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
bike on the road outside so when you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.890 
bike on the road outside so when you
start<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.730> step<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> gas<00:02:47.239> more<00:02:47.629> davidann

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
start to step on the gas more davidann

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.059 
start to step on the gas more davidann
and<00:02:48.049> start<00:02:48.200> getting<00:02:48.409> your<00:02:48.470> pedaling<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:48.859> little

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
and start getting your pedaling a little

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.699 
and start getting your pedaling a little
bit<00:02:49.159> more<00:02:51.639> so<00:02:52.639> I'm<00:02:53.060> assuming<00:02:53.540> now<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.720> pretty

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
bit more so I'm assuming now that pretty

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.099 
bit more so I'm assuming now that pretty
much<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.099> resistance<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.359> he<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:57.049> to

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
much the resistance that he is going to

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.080 
much the resistance that he is going to
feel<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:58.099> gonna<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> result<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.909> both

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
feel it's gonna be the result of both

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.379 
feel it's gonna be the result of both
the<00:02:59.389> shifting<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> the<00:02:59.959> years<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.730> how<00:03:02.209> much

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
the shifting of the years and how much

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.069 
the shifting of the years and how much
actual<00:03:02.959> muscle<00:03:03.500> tension<00:03:03.920> C<00:03:04.129> applies

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
actual muscle tension C applies

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.210 
actual muscle tension C applies
absolutely<00:03:06.079> so<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.379> more<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:06.709> if<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:06.950> stay<00:03:07.159> in

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
absolutely so the more so if you stay in

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890 
absolutely so the more so if you stay in
the<00:03:07.340> same<00:03:07.549> gear<00:03:07.819> Dave<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.599> you<00:03:08.659> begin<00:03:08.840> to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
the same gear Dave and you begin to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.679 
the same gear Dave and you begin to
apply<00:03:09.230> more<00:03:09.620> muscle<00:03:10.069> tension<00:03:10.489> do<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.450> feel<00:03:11.659> a

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
apply more muscle tension do you feel a

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.000 
apply more muscle tension do you feel a
change<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.230> resistance<00:03:12.349> in<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.859> back<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
change in the resistance in the back and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.309 
change in the resistance in the back and
a<00:03:16.040> little<00:03:16.099> faster<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:16.700> me<00:03:16.939> even<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.359> right

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
a little faster for me even and right

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.170 
a little faster for me even and right
away<00:03:18.470> begins<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:18.980> progressive<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
away begins to get progressive so it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.599 
away begins to get progressive so it
begins<00:03:20.389> to<00:03:20.599> go<00:03:20.750> up<00:03:21.139> yeah<00:03:21.530> yep<00:03:21.889> absolutely

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
begins to go up yeah yep absolutely

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.470 
begins to go up yeah yep absolutely
which<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.879> why<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.329> feel<00:03:23.449> more

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
which is why it's going to feel more

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.920 
which is why it's going to feel more
like<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:24.139> good<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.680> better<00:03:24.980> Road<00:03:25.250> feel<00:03:25.549> yeah<00:03:26.419> now

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
like a good a better Road feel yeah now

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.770 
like a good a better Road feel yeah now
right<00:03:27.139> away<00:03:27.260> for<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.280> on<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.699> bike<00:03:28.910> what<00:03:29.720> do

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
right away for you on the bike what do

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.759 
right away for you on the bike what do
you<00:03:29.840> notice<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.169> biggest<00:03:30.440> difference

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
you notice the biggest difference

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.170 
you notice the biggest difference
between<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.430> menorah<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.909> you<00:03:32.000> were<00:03:32.060> just

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
between the menorah that you were just

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.170 
between the menorah that you were just
gone<00:03:32.419> and<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.139> kinetic<00:03:33.549> why<00:03:34.549> do<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.790> notice

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
gone and the kinetic why do I notice

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.300 
gone and the kinetic why do I notice
that<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.629> actual<00:03:36.199> deal<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.799> resistance

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
that the actual deal in the resistance

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.330 
that the actual deal in the resistance
to<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.449> when<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.109> first<00:03:39.139> start<00:03:39.620> off<00:03:39.739> it's

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
to you when you first start off it's

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.210 
to you when you first start off it's
fairly<00:03:40.579> easy<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.019> pedal<00:03:42.139> harder<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:43.040> cut

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
fairly easy as you pedal harder to cut

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.750 
fairly easy as you pedal harder to cut
harder<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.919> it's<00:03:46.040> got<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.190> little<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:46.609> got<00:03:46.729> a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
harder so it's got a little it's got a

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.420 
harder so it's got a little it's got a
little<00:03:46.909> bit<00:03:47.060> more<00:03:47.209> noise<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.840> yeah<00:03:48.440> yep<00:03:48.889> but

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
little bit more noise to it yeah yep but

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.369 
little bit more noise to it yeah yep but
that<00:03:49.549> comes<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.150> nice<00:03:50.479> benefit<00:03:51.109> of<00:03:51.290> having

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
that comes with a nice benefit of having

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.770 
that comes with a nice benefit of having
a<00:03:51.560> little<00:03:51.769> bit<00:03:51.859> bigger<00:03:52.400> flywheel<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.269> little

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
a little bit bigger flywheel a little

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.869 
a little bit bigger flywheel a little
bit<00:03:53.870> more<00:03:54.079> tension<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.979> to<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.250> bicycle<00:03:55.760> a

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
bit more tension going to the bicycle a

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.599 
bit more tension going to the bicycle a
little<00:03:56.329> bit<00:03:56.419> better<00:03:56.540> Road<00:03:56.810> feel<00:03:57.109> right<00:03:57.609> but

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
little bit better Road feel right but

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.520 
little bit better Road feel right but
let's<00:03:58.819> let's<00:03:59.299> do<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.510> standing<00:03:59.900> calf<00:04:00.109> so<00:04:00.409> it's

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
let's let's do the standing calf so it's

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.379 
let's let's do the standing calf so it's
getting<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.769> little<00:04:00.859> harder<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.549> let's<00:04:02.180> get

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
getting a little harder here let's get

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.920 
getting a little harder here let's get
you<00:04:02.510> out<00:04:02.629> of<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.780> saddle

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.449 

again<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.860> usually<00:04:08.099> want<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
again what you usually want to be

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.789 
again what you usually want to be
looking<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.750> how<00:04:09.930> much<00:04:10.079> lateral<00:04:10.319> rotation

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
looking for is how much lateral rotation

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.000 
looking for is how much lateral rotation
both<00:04:11.159> in<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> frame<00:04:12.079> and<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.739> device

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
both in the frame and in the device

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.969 
both in the frame and in the device
itself<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.760> sit<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:15.030> me<00:04:17.090> yeah<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> mean<00:04:18.299> it's

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
itself and sit for me yeah I mean it's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.199 
itself and sit for me yeah I mean it's
that's<00:04:19.979> pretty<00:04:20.190> darn<00:04:20.370> smooth<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.970> not

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
that's pretty darn smooth it's not

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.310 
that's pretty darn smooth it's not
moving<00:04:21.630> at<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:23.000> how<00:04:24.000> much<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.419> get<00:04:25.199> one

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
moving at all how much is the get one

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.830 
moving at all how much is the get one
have<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.530> stopped<00:04:25.770> pedaling<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.280> for<00:04:26.490> me

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
have you stopped pedaling that for me

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.879 
have you stopped pedaling that for me
how<00:04:27.840> much<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.259> price<00:04:28.440> point<00:04:28.650> on<00:04:28.800> the

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
how much is the price point on the

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.370 
how much is the price point on the
kinetic<00:04:29.220> here<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.639> kinetic<00:04:30.060> we<00:04:30.240> sell<00:04:30.449> for<00:04:30.660> 319

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
kinetic here the kinetic we sell for 319

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.020 
kinetic here the kinetic we sell for 319
okay<00:04:32.039> it's<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.340> great<00:04:32.580> value

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
okay it's a great value

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.460 
okay it's a great value
one<00:04:33.300> thing<00:04:33.449> we<00:04:33.570> ever<00:04:33.720> really<00:04:34.020> even<00:04:34.050> talked

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
one thing we ever really even talked

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.860 
one thing we ever really even talked
about<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.130> overall<00:04:35.520> durability<00:04:35.910> there

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
about is the overall durability there

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.749 
about is the overall durability there
this<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.440> engineered<00:04:37.979> so<00:04:38.070> well<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.639> actually

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
this is engineered so well it actually

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.969 
this is engineered so well it actually
comes<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.389> lifetime<00:04:39.979> unconditional

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
comes with a lifetime unconditional

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.820 
comes with a lifetime unconditional
warranty<00:04:41.220> really<00:04:41.789> yep<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.419> in<00:04:43.410> regards<00:04:43.740> to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
warranty really yep and in regards to

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.320 
warranty really yep and in regards to
trainers<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.460> that's<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.789> pretty<00:04:44.970> big<00:04:45.120> deal<00:04:45.270> I

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.089 
meter which of course is one of the most
important<00:06:04.020> things<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.289> recommend<00:06:04.470> for<00:06:04.889> indoor

important things I recommend for indoor
training<00:06:05.550> obviously<00:06:06.300> again<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.840> resistance

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
training obviously again the resistance

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.649 
training obviously again the resistance
is<00:06:07.680> through<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:07.919> rear<00:06:08.130> wheel<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:09.150> unless<00:06:09.510> you

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
is through the rear wheel so unless you

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.570 
is through the rear wheel so unless you
have<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.810> power<00:06:10.050> tap<00:06:10.380> or<00:06:10.979> some<00:06:11.220> other<00:06:11.340> kind<00:06:11.550> of
