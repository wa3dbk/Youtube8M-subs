your master up you'll notice because
everything<00:00:44.340> sitting<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:44.940> level

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
everything sitting at the right level

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.549

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
whereas when you were making it maybe

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.840 
whereas when you were making it maybe
you<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:46.860> caught<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> moment<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:47.640> didn't

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you got caught in the moment he didn't

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.569 
you got caught in the moment he didn't
really<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> set<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> levels<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.579> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
really get to set the levels right so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
really get to set the levels right so
that<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.719> really

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that you know that's that's really

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.950 
that you know that's that's really
important<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:53.090> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> star<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.510> fresh<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
important to in the star from fresh and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
important to in the star from fresh and
then<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.260> start<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.340> really

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
then you can start you know really

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
then you can start you know really
mixing<00:00:57.329> i<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:58.199> even<00:00:58.320> remap<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
mixing i can even remap it out to a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.260 
mixing i can even remap it out to a
controller<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.149> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
controller and have a little more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
controller and have a little more
hands-on<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.590> once<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.340> 30

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
hands-on but once you get up to like 30

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
hands-on but once you get up to like 30

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
stuff with controller so it's pretty a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020 
stuff with controller so it's pretty a
mousy<00:01:08.880> type<00:01:09.090> thing<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> um<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> yeah

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
sounding right um i checked my final

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
sounding right um i checked my final
levels<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> everything<00:01:18.150> usually<00:01:18.299> turns<00:01:18.720> out

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
levels and everything usually turns out

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
levels and everything usually turns out
just<00:01:19.140> fine<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> point<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.220> i<00:01:20.810> went

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just fine at that point because i went

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
just fine at that point because i went
to<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.259> steps<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.950> building<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.780> eek

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
to three steps you know building it eek

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.789 
to three steps you know building it eek
ewing<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.369> mixing<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.939> again

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
ewing it and then mixing it all again

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
ewing it and then mixing it all again
you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.890> fix<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.820> final<00:01:30.119> touches<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you know fix up some final touches and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
you know fix up some final touches and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
then you're both done with the track so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.760 
then you're both done with the track so
what<00:01:33.090> I'll<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.390> I'll<00:01:34.079> play<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.560> bit
