00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.840
 Like you wrong language welcome 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.509
 to makeup for everyone today we're going to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 paint dogs the materials that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.640
 we will need to paint we are 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 synthetic brushes great sponges 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.199
 density or mud makeup to water and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.090
 water if you want a description more 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 detailed of the materials that I'm going to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.449
 use I'll leave the link below in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 the description so let's start 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 first with a mud sponge or 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 great density split in half 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 moistened in water we passed it by 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 white water makeup we are going to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 simulate the dog's ears to both 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 sides then we go to do the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 snout from the center 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.950
 towards the exteriors we are going to delimit 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710
 it a little with the edges of the sponge 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.640
 and giving small touches we intensify 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 the target 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.650
 let's move on now to make the little mouth 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.840
 of the dog as before giving the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.370
 small touches to intensify and with 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.370
 the edges to delimit 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.370
 with black makeup we give a few touches 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.690
 in the nose to secure the root of 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.880
 dog and then we went to 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.940
 eye in which we are going to make a great 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.770
 I 'm just going to do it in one eye 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.580
 but if you want you can do it in the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.320
 two 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.590
 we are small touches for 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 intensify and we limit a bit with 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.680
 the edges look at me cause with the eye 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.160
 this part is a little out of focus what 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.130
 I feel next time it will not be like this 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.620
 with pink makeup let's simulate the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.620
 tongue of the dog on the right side 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.479
 we give small touches 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.330
 with the help of a synthetic brush and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 red makeup we are going to delimit the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.650
 edges of the tongue 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.680
 and with a brush stroke in the center we do 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.480
 this appearance of the language let's see 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.390
 a few small touches with the help of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.489
 brush to give a little relief for 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.170
 up and then a little bit in the middle 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.890
 let's give it shine with a little 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 White 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.770
 and we are going to do it on the opposite side 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.550
 in which we have put a red shadow 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.550
 ah 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.950
 below with black makeup 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.860
 we are going to delimit well the mouth and the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.560
 snout first one side and then the other 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.720
 let's make a line in the middle to 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 make the mouth split in two 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:21.500
 We extend towards the exterior putting 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:24.350
 the mouth a little smiling then 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.560
 let's delineate the ears 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.500
 we start at the top we go down and 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.580
 we ended up doing some peaks simulating 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.580
 dog hair 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.709
 we do exactly the same in the other 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.709
 side 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.550
 next we are going to finalize our 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.660
 eye using the brush to make it 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.660
 well delineated 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.390
 finally with a smaller brush and 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.930
 black paint we are going to simulate the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.930
 pilots 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.519
 and ready and we have finished in our 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.070
 makeup and you have seen that for nothing 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.870
 It has been difficult and it is very funny because 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.560
 if you want you can put some moles 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.960
 in the ears or simulate a few dogs 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.139
 different for example Dalmatians like 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.139
 you want and nothing has finished 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.539
 and subscribe to my channel a greeting and 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.539
 until the next video
