when<00:00:01.040> I<00:00:01.069> decided<00:00:01.430> to<00:00:01.580> start<00:00:01.790> device

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179 
when I decided to start device

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:03.669 
when I decided to start device
technologies<00:00:02.899> that<00:00:03.019> was<00:00:03.169> the<00:00:03.229> first<00:00:03.439> tool

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679

technologies that was the first tool
that<00:00:03.830> I<00:00:03.919> bought<00:00:04.100> for<00:00:04.279> myself<00:00:04.430> was<00:00:04.819> when

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:05.149 
that I bought for myself was when

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.470 
that I bought for myself was when

commit<00:00:13.400> to<00:00:13.610> two<00:00:14.360> prototypes<00:00:14.900> is<00:00:15.760> very<00:00:16.760> well

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
commit to two prototypes is very well

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.490 
commit to two prototypes is very well
worth<00:00:17.150> it<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:17.540> the<00:00:17.750> medical<00:00:18.050> device<00:00:18.170> field

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
worth it and the medical device field

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.560 
worth it and the medical device field
things<00:00:18.740> are<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.010> small<00:00:19.370> that<00:00:19.670> making

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
things are so small that making

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.859 
things are so small that making
prototypes<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:21.140> not<00:00:21.800> necessarily<00:00:22.250> cheap<00:00:22.869> that

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
prototypes is not necessarily cheap that

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.750 
prototypes is not necessarily cheap that
cost<00:00:24.230> some<00:00:24.470> money<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:24.770> develop<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.100> processes

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
cost some money to develop the processes

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.820 
cost some money to develop the processes
to<00:00:25.910> make<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.240> prototypes<00:00:26.690> so<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.470> allows<00:00:27.680> you

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
to make the prototypes so it allows you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.890 
to make the prototypes so it allows you
to<00:00:28.010> think<00:00:28.250> through<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.580> process<00:00:29.060> before<00:00:29.660> we

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
to think through the process before we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.960 
to think through the process before we

the trending in medical devices is in

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.430 
the trending in medical devices is in
some<00:00:34.760> ways<00:00:34.909> following<00:00:35.539> the<00:00:36.079> trend<00:00:36.319> in

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
some ways following the trend in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.950 
some ways following the trend in
consumer<00:00:36.890> products<00:00:37.309> where<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.329> design<00:00:38.809> and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
consumer products where the design and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.719 
consumer products where the design and
configuration<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.679> the<00:00:39.739> parts<00:00:40.039> are<00:00:40.249> of<00:00:40.609> the

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:40.729 
configuration of the parts are of the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.329 
configuration of the parts are of the
products<00:00:41.089> are<00:00:41.210> very<00:00:41.390> as<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.899> very<00:00:42.140> organic<00:00:42.469> feel

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
products are very as a very organic feel

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.430 
products are very as a very organic feel
to<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.640> very<00:00:43.879> ergonomic<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.719> medical<00:00:45.379> devices

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
to it very ergonomic and medical devices

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.790 
to it very ergonomic and medical devices
is<00:00:45.920> very<00:00:46.129> much<00:00:46.339> following<00:00:46.819> that<00:00:46.999> path<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:47.800> so

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
is very much following that path and so

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.619 
is very much following that path and so
the<00:00:48.979> servicing<00:00:49.429> capabilities<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.239> celebrex

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
the servicing capabilities and celebrex

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.229 
the servicing capabilities and celebrex
allows<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.799> create<00:00:52.129> very<00:00:52.399> smooth

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
allows you to to create very smooth

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.569 
allows you to to create very smooth
organic<00:00:53.780> surfaces<00:00:54.319> and<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.429> can

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
organic surfaces and then you can

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.209 
organic surfaces and then you can
transfer<00:00:56.299> the<00:00:56.389> file<00:00:56.569> electronically<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.469> the

transfer the file electronically and the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.399 
transfer the file electronically and the
CNC<00:00:58.609> equipment<00:00:58.639> can<00:00:59.179> create<00:00:59.569> a<00:00:59.629> tool<00:00:59.780> path<00:00:59.989> and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
CNC equipment can create a tool path and

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.590 
CNC equipment can create a tool path and
