there's<00:01:38.829> nothing<00:01:39.100> Kelly<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.459> do<00:01:39.579> nothing

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
there's nothing Kelly can do nothing

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.699 
there's nothing Kelly can do nothing
even<00:01:40.179> now<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:40.780> done<00:01:40.959> it's<00:01:41.319> wrapped<00:01:41.530> it's

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
even now it's done it's wrapped it's

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.309 
even now it's done it's wrapped it's
over<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:42.639> mix<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.749> got<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.929> keep<00:01:44.049> rolling

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
over so mix just got to keep rolling

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.599 
over so mix just got to keep rolling
through<00:01:44.709> I<00:01:44.740> think<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.009> two<00:01:45.159> more<00:01:45.310> heats<00:01:45.490> he's

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
through I think it's two more heats he's

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.520 
through I think it's two more heats he's
gotta<00:01:45.759> win<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.509> he<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.780> one<00:01:46.959> is<00:01:47.079> round<00:01:47.319> three

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
gotta win so he just one is round three

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.109 
gotta win so he just one is round three
heats<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.009> two<00:01:48.280> more<00:01:48.429> heats<00:01:48.639> would<00:01:48.819> probably

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
heats so two more heats would probably

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.100 
heats so two more heats would probably
do<00:01:49.240> it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
do it

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.310 
do it
and<00:01:52.060> not<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.210> ever<00:01:53.390> want<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.570> get<00:01:53.660> into<00:01:53.720> inside
