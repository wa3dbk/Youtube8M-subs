of us in Panama use the procedure

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.859 
of us in Panama use the procedure
instead<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.579> using<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.939> procedure<00:01:13.090> using<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
instead of using a procedure using the

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.740 
instead of using a procedure using the
patient's<00:01:14.380> own<00:01:14.530> facts<00:01:15.219> come<00:01:15.490> sells<00:01:15.789> it<00:01:16.270> for

diseases such as a woman toilet players

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.529 
diseases such as a woman toilet players
and<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.950> initial<00:01:21.159> concept<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.210> got<00:01:22.390> us

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
and the initial concept that got us

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.170 
and the initial concept that got us
excited<00:01:22.689> initial<00:01:23.469> our<00:01:23.530> patient<00:01:23.920> observation

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
excited initial our patient observation

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.429 
excited initial our patient observation
was<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.509> started<00:01:25.930> seeing<00:01:26.109> in<00:01:26.380> our

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
was that we started seeing in our

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.639 
was that we started seeing in our
patients<00:01:27.270> similar<00:01:28.270> responses<00:01:29.140> as<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.469> would

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
patients similar responses as you would

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.700 
patients similar responses as you would
see<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:30.460> your<00:01:30.670> patients<00:01:31.240> right<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:32.020> what<00:01:32.500> kind

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
see in your patients right so what kind

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.999 
see in your patients right so what kind
of<00:01:32.770> thinking<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.369> how<00:01:34.060> do<00:01:34.600> these<00:01:34.840> cells<00:01:35.409> work

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
of thinking is how do these cells work

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.669 
of thinking is how do these cells work
from<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> mechanistic<00:01:37.390> point<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:38.049> view<00:01:38.229> so

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
from a mechanistic point of view so

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.039 
from a mechanistic point of view so
we're<00:01:38.920> truly<00:01:39.159> during<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.759> from<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.539> bedside

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
we're truly during the from the bedside

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
and the clinicians view of observations

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.779 
and the clinicians view of observations
in<00:01:43.750> patients<00:01:44.229> now<00:01:44.590> back<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.189> bench<00:01:45.460> top

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
support why we see these clinical

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.169 
support why we see these clinical
effects<00:01:49.749> exactly<00:01:50.619> ok<00:01:50.770> several<00:01:51.340> years<00:01:51.429> ago<00:01:51.670> we

effects exactly ok several years ago we

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.359 
effects exactly ok several years ago we
filed<00:01:52.659> some<00:01:52.960> data<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.469> we<00:01:53.590> are<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.890> published

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.540 
patient with with rheumatoid arthritis
we<00:02:29.080> probably<00:02:29.320> don't<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.740> what<00:02:29.980> triggered<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
we probably don't know what triggered it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.060 
we probably don't know what triggered it
but<00:02:30.970> something<00:02:31.390> causes<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.990> body<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.380> attack

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
but something causes the body to attack

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.670 
but something causes the body to attack
itself<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.240> I've<00:02:34.390> got<00:02:34.600> swollen<00:02:34.900> joints

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
itself so now I've got swollen joints

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.810 
itself so now I've got swollen joints
and<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> lot<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.160> pain<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.150> very<00:02:37.510> ill<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:39.070> how

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
and a lot of pain in a very ill so how

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.360 
and a lot of pain in a very ill so how
did<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.450> cells<00:02:40.720> might<00:02:41.370> actually

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
did you think the cells might actually

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.220 
did you think the cells might actually
impact<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.150> disease<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:43.840> what<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
impact a disease like now what is the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.720 
impact a disease like now what is the
thought<00:02:44.440> because<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.070> not<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
thought because it's not just the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.070 
thought because it's not just the
thought<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.060> stem<00:02:46.300> cell<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.690> makes<00:02:46.870> some

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
thought of a stem cell that makes some

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.330 
thought of a stem cell that makes some
tissue<00:02:47.320> which<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.620> what<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:48.010> all<00:02:48.160> thought

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
tissue which is what we all thought

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.920 
tissue which is what we all thought
originally<00:02:48.640> what's<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.780> on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
originally what's going on

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.540 
originally what's going on
scientifically<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.400> really

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
scientifically here so it's really

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.120 
scientifically here so it's really
really<00:02:51.910> interesting<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:53.260> general<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.890> lot<00:02:54.040> of

we're<00:03:40.209> by<00:03:40.450> coincidence<00:03:40.780> there's<00:03:41.560> also<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.950> lot

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
we're by coincidence there's also a lot

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.850 
we're by coincidence there's also a lot
of<00:03:42.100> stem<00:03:42.400> cells<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.300> we<00:03:43.510> figured<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.290> by

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
of stem cells so we figured that by

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.920 
of stem cells so we figured that by
using<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.610> souls<00:03:45.910> from<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.180> facts<00:03:46.660> tissue

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
using the souls from the facts tissue

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.590 
using the souls from the facts tissue
and<00:03:47.320> put<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.070> back<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.580> body<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.330> can

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
and put in the back in the body you can

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.229 
and put in the back in the body you can
bring<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.230> balance<00:03:50.440> back<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> same

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
bring the balance back and at the same

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.350 
bring the balance back and at the same
time<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:53.739> stem<00:03:54.489> cells<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.970> okay<00:03:55.330> to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
time you have stem cells that okay to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.800 
time you have stem cells that okay to
the<00:03:55.540> damage<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.170> has<00:03:56.680> been<00:03:56.709> done<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:58.330> site<00:03:58.630> so

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
the damage that has been done at site so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.930 
the damage that has been done at site so
the<00:03:58.989> two<00:03:59.200> using<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.800> patient's<00:04:00.340> own<00:04:00.489> cells

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
the two using the patient's own cells

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.510 
the two using the patient's own cells
and<00:04:01.360> just<00:04:01.900> taking<00:04:02.290> them<00:04:02.440> out<00:04:02.620> concentrating

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
and just taking them out concentrating

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.070 
and just taking them out concentrating
them<00:04:03.700> getting<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.390> sort<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.630> separate<00:04:05.050> but

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
them getting in sort of separate but

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.810 
them getting in sort of separate but
still<00:04:05.500> it's<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.800> mix<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.220> cells<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:06.610> not<00:04:06.790> a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
still it's a mix of cells it's not a

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.850 
still it's a mix of cells it's not a
Puritan<00:04:07.330> stem<00:04:07.750> cell<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.380> just<00:04:08.620> mix

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
Puritan stem cell it's just mix

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.770 
Puritan stem cell it's just mix
ourselves<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:09.880> put<00:04:10.150> them<00:04:10.269> back<00:04:10.480> in

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
ourselves and you put them back in

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.350 
ourselves and you put them back in
through<00:04:11.110> an<00:04:11.170> IV<00:04:11.320> thank<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.220> admit<00:04:12.820> exactly

through an IV thank you admit exactly

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.180 
through an IV thank you admit exactly
it's<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.510> very<00:04:13.750> simple<00:04:14.110> procedure

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
it's a very simple procedure

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.550 
it's a very simple procedure
many<00:04:15.640> liposuction<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:16.870> purified<00:04:17.410> themselves

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
in the solidified level tour and you put

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.980 
in the solidified level tour and you put

them back into the penis way and so far

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.440 
them back into the penis way and so far
we<00:04:23.740> have<00:04:23.860> traded<00:04:24.130> several<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.120> couple

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
we have traded several and a couple

hundred patients with this procedure and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.090 
hundred patients with this procedure and
some<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> data<00:04:29.290> has<00:04:29.500> not<00:04:29.710> published

woman's<00:04:35.710> want<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:35.980> play<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.220> which<00:04:36.940> we've

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
woman's want to play this which we've

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.870 
woman's want to play this which we've
published<00:04:37.710> well<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:39.340> me<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:39.670> so

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
published well I to me it's so

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.120 
published well I to me it's so
fascinating<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.080> fabulous<00:04:41.470> because<00:04:41.860> now

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
fascinating and so fabulous because now

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.570 
fascinating and so fabulous because now
we're<00:04:42.430> truly<00:04:42.760> linking<00:04:43.450> up<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.950> clinician

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
we're truly linking up the clinician

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.000 
we're truly linking up the clinician
seeing<00:04:46.210> things<00:04:46.480> in<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.780> clinic<00:04:47.170> ability<00:04:47.890> to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
seeing things in the clinic ability to

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.100 
seeing things in the clinic ability to
use<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.190> patient's<00:04:48.760> own<00:04:48.880> innate<00:04:49.450> ability<00:04:49.960> to

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
use a patient's own innate ability to

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.170 
use a patient's own innate ability to
heal<00:04:50.350> themselves<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.070> we're<00:04:51.730> just<00:04:51.940> sort<00:04:52.120> of

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
heal themselves and we're just sort of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.210 
heal themselves and we're just sort of
helping<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:52.900> then<00:04:53.380> now<00:04:53.560> trying<00:04:53.920> to<00:04:53.980> apply

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
helping it and then now trying to apply

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.040 
helping it and then now trying to apply
the<00:04:54.310> science<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.000> understand<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:55.930> now

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the science to understand it so now

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.220 
the science to understand it so now
we've<00:04:56.290> got<00:04:56.500> from<00:04:57.190> bench<00:04:57.580> back<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.750> bedside

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
we've got from bench back to the bedside

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.290 
we've got from bench back to the bedside
or<00:04:59.590> our<00:04:59.950> piece<00:05:00.160> next<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.790> stall<00:05:01.060> and

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
or our piece next to the stall and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.050 
or our piece next to the stall and
that's<00:05:01.720> nice<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.590> then<00:05:02.980> coming<00:05:03.220> back<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.940> the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
that's nice and then coming back to the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.270 
that's nice and then coming back to the
bench<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.540> try<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.720> understand<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.980> we<00:05:06.130> could

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
bench and try to understand so we could

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.890 
bench and try to understand so we could
optimize<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:07.390> patients<00:05:07.600> are

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
optimize this because patients are

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.710 
optimize this because patients are
variable<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:08.590> we<00:05:09.250> see<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.490> but<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.480> really

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
variable and we see that but it's really

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.050 
variable and we see that but it's really
spectacular<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.620> see<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.010> if<00:05:12.580> for<00:05:12.760> me<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:12.970> a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
spectacular to see and if for me is a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.300 
spectacular to see and if for me is a
veterinarian<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.720> see<00:05:13.930> clinical<00:05:14.530> effects<00:05:15.070> in

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
veterinarian to see clinical effects in

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.610 
veterinarian to see clinical effects in
many<00:05:15.730> many<00:05:15.880> animals<00:05:16.420> and<00:05:16.570> then<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.840> see<00:05:17.050> that

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
many many animals and then to see that

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.350 
many many animals and then to see that
my<00:05:17.770> colleagues<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.400> human<00:05:18.730> side<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.970> doing

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
my colleagues on the human side of doing

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.510 
my colleagues on the human side of doing
this<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.780> we<00:05:20.260> get<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.590> same<00:05:20.860> set<00:05:21.100> of<00:05:21.130> effects

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
this and we get the same set of effects

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.920 
this and we get the same set of effects
and<00:05:21.640> diseases<00:05:21.940> what<00:05:22.240> we<00:05:22.330> really<00:05:22.600> don't<00:05:22.690> have

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
and diseases what we really don't have

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.600 
and diseases what we really don't have

very limited side effects it's hugely

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.850 
very limited side effects it's hugely
excited<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.280> I'm<00:05:34.030> hoping<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.470> name<00:05:35.710> of

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
excited and I'm hoping that the name of

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.200 
excited and I'm hoping that the name of
one<00:05:36.040> of<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.190> journals<00:05:36.550> that<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.730> publish<00:05:37.060> it

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
one of the journals that you publish it

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.240 
one of the journals that you publish it
is<00:05:37.300> translational<00:05:37.960> medicine<00:05:38.290> and<00:05:38.620> that<00:05:38.830> truly

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
is translational medicine and that truly

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.640 
is translational medicine and that truly
means<00:05:39.400> taking<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:40.090> from<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.690> science<00:05:41.110> concept

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
means taking it from the science concept

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.920 
means taking it from the science concept
of<00:05:41.770> translating<00:05:42.370> into<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.730> clinic<00:05:43.090> yeah<00:05:43.660> you

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
of translating into the clinic yeah you

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.120 
of translating into the clinic yeah you
guys<00:05:44.110> are<00:05:44.140> actually<00:05:44.560> doing<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.040> that's

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
guys are actually doing it and that's
