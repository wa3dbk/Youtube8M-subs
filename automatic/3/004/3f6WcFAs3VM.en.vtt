of<00:01:05.220> colors<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.180> I've<00:01:06.390> chose<00:01:06.900> white<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> I've

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
of colors but I've chose white and I've

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
of colors but I've chose white and I've
choice<00:01:08.520> natural<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.270> figure<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
choice natural because I figure that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.270 
choice natural because I figure that
would<00:01:09.930> give<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> most<00:01:10.380> versatility<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
would give me the most versatility I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.950 
would give me the most versatility I
won't<00:01:11.760> say<00:01:11.970> though<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.180> prefer<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> natural

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
won't say though I prefer the natural

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.730 
won't say though I prefer the natural
it's<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.490> hair<00:01:14.880> darker<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.470> make

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's just a hair darker if you can make

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's just a hair darker if you can make
out<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> difference<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> video<00:01:17.850> it's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
out the difference on the video it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
out the difference on the video it's
just<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.689> hair<00:01:18.900> darker<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.950> um<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> takes<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just a hair darker but um it takes the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
just a hair darker but um it takes the
krinkle<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> seems<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
krinkle a lot better it seems to be a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
krinkle a lot better it seems to be a
little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.500> less<00:01:22.920> tightly<00:01:23.520> woven<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.150> also

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
little bit less tightly woven it's also

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.230 
little bit less tightly woven it's also
a<00:01:24.420> tiny<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:24.960> wider<00:01:25.759> but<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> doesn't<00:01:27.090> matter

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a tiny bit wider but it doesn't matter

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.670 
a tiny bit wider but it doesn't matter
you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.659> whatever<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.439> next

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you can get whatever kind you want next

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
you can get whatever kind you want next
time<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> order<00:01:29.310> two<00:01:29.640> rolls<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
time I want to order two rolls of the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
time I want to order two rolls of the
natural<00:01:31.110> instead<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> each<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.340> think

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
natural instead of one of each I think

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.080 
natural instead of one of each I think
so<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
so the first thing you want to do is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
so the first thing you want to do is
snip<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.869> live<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> roll<00:01:37.829> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
snip off to live in from the roll so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
snip off to live in from the roll so
that<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:38.700> contaminate<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.270> roll

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that way you don't contaminate your roll

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.899 
that way you don't contaminate your roll
when<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.500> dyeing<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
when you're dyeing it

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.520 
when you're dyeing it
I'm<00:01:43.420> gonna<00:01:43.539> snip<00:01:43.810> off<00:01:43.929> some<00:01:44.140> white<00:01:44.289> into

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
I'm gonna snip off some white into

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.450 
I'm gonna snip off some white into
natural<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:44.979> will<00:01:45.130> show<00:01:45.249> you<00:01:45.340> how

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
natural this will show you how

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.859 
natural this will show you how
differently<00:01:45.939> they<00:01:46.179> careful

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
differently they careful

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.050 
differently they careful
I<00:01:47.130> imagine<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.219> colored<00:01:48.460> ones<00:01:48.640> crinkles

frame<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:35.140> white<00:02:35.290> doesn't<00:02:35.560> have<00:02:35.829> such<00:02:36.159> an

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
frame and the white doesn't have such an

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.009 
frame and the white doesn't have such an
intense<00:02:36.640> crinkle<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.329> crinkles<00:02:37.599> really

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
intense crinkle but it crinkles really

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.440
