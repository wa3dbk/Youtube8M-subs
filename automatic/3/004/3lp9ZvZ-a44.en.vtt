too<00:01:04.860> cheesy<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.240> sometimes<00:01:06.720> they're

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
too cheesy because sometimes they're

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200 
too cheesy because sometimes they're
limited<00:01:07.290> edition<00:01:07.590> packaging<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.880> little

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
too cheesy for my taste this is their

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.719 
too cheesy for my taste this is their
blush<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.549> fleet<00:01:12.210> fast<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
blush in fleet fast and it is just a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
blush in fleet fast and it is just a
really<00:01:15.180> pretty<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.110> muted<00:01:16.740> coral

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
really pretty kind of like muted coral

really pretty kind of like muted coral
reddish<00:01:18.360> toned<00:01:18.689> color<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.619> wearing<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.040> right

reddish toned color I'm wearing it right
now<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
now and I think that it is just so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
now and I think that it is just so
pretty<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> coral<00:01:23.759> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
pretty it's kind of like a coral that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
pretty it's kind of like a coral that's
more<00:01:24.630> suited<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.110> light<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.680> medium<00:01:25.830> skin

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
more suited for light or medium skin

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
more suited for light or medium skin
tones<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.820> oftentimes<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.630> find<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
tones because oftentimes I find that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
tones because oftentimes I find that
these<00:01:28.200> color<00:01:28.890> blushes<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.850> work<00:01:30.060> nicely

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
these color blushes really work nicely

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
these color blushes really work nicely
on<00:01:30.689> dark<00:01:31.020> complexions<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.829> medium

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
on dark complexions or medium

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.670 
on dark complexions or medium
complexions<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> coral<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.960> sometimes<00:01:34.470> be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
complexions and coral can sometimes be

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
complexions and coral can sometimes be
just<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.070> too<00:01:35.430> red<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.270> light

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just a little too red for light

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
just a little too red for light
complexions<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.579> just

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
complexions but this one I think is just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
complexions but this one I think is just
so<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.630> beautiful<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> satin<00:01:40.770> finish<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
so so beautiful it's a satin finish it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.050 
so so beautiful it's a satin finish it
has<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.380> subtle<00:01:43.380> hint<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.860> gold<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
has a very very subtle hint of gold to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
has a very very subtle hint of gold to
it<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> golden<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.439> even<00:01:46.770> quite<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it like a golden not even quite a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
it like a golden not even quite a
shimmer<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.880> gold<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
shimmer but just a gold so that is the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080

of this product I think everyone kind of
assumed<00:02:18.849> since<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:19.540> were<00:02:19.629> calling<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.049> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
assumed since they were calling it a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.069 
assumed since they were calling it a
highlight<00:02:20.680> powder<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.180> colored<00:02:22.750> parts

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
highlight powder that the colored parts

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.690 
highlight powder that the colored parts
of<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.260> were<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.739> an<00:02:23.829> over<00:02:24.099> spray<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
of it were going to be an over spray and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.220 
of it were going to be an over spray and
then<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.879> would<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.030> fade<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> white<00:02:25.900> color

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
then it would just fade to a white color

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.619 
then it would just fade to a white color
but<00:02:26.860> actually<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.640> opposite<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.269> white

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629
