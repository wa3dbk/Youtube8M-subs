00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.360 

just<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.059> looks<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.540> bit<00:00:39.719> nicer<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:43.370> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
paint and with the same brush I only use

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.130 
paint and with the same brush I only use
two<00:00:51.120> brushes<00:00:51.420> I'm<00:00:52.340> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:54.390> over<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
two brushes I'm going to go over the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
two brushes I'm going to go over the
bottom<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> thin<00:00:57.930> line<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.420> then

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
bottom and make a thin line and then

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.640 
bottom and make a thin line and then
make<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:00.930> lines<00:01:02.180> diagonal<00:01:03.180> lines<00:01:03.650> facing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
make two lines diagonal lines facing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.460 
make two lines diagonal lines facing
inwards<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> skirt<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
inwards so that the this is a skirt it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.240 
inwards so that the this is a skirt it's
divided<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.150> three<00:01:12.150> sections<00:01:13.010> since<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
divided into three sections since we

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
divided into three sections since we
can't<00:01:14.280> fit<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> whole<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:18.259> now<00:01:19.259> we're

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
can't fit the whole thing and now we're

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
can't fit the whole thing and now we're
going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> outline<00:01:19.950> everything<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.460> blacks

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to outline everything with blacks

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.270 
going to outline everything with blacks
so<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> outline<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.530> top

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so I'm just going to outline the top

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
so I'm just going to outline the top
part<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> yellow<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.450> black<00:01:24.950> all<00:01:25.950> over

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
part of the yellow with black all over

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
part of the yellow with black all over
the<00:01:26.580> cross<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.030> nail<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.840> taking<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the cross the nail and then taking the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.880 
the cross the nail and then taking the
black<00:01:28.619> we're<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> outline<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
black we're going to outline the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
black we're going to outline the
diagonal<00:01:31.890> line<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.280> made<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.939> we're<00:01:33.180> just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
diagonal line that we made so we're just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
diagonal line that we made so we're just
going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> start<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> bottom<00:01:34.880> go<00:01:35.880> all

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
going to start from the bottom go all

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to start from the bottom go all
the<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> top<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> same<00:01:37.799> thing

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the way to the top and do the same thing

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.020 
the way to the top and do the same thing
on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.790> other<00:01:38.820> side<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.780> line

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.100 

so<00:01:46.630> we<00:01:46.780> have<00:01:46.930> something<00:01:47.470> like<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.110> I'm

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
so we have something like this and I'm

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.899 
so we have something like this and I'm
just<00:01:50.260> going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.440> make<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.860> black<00:01:51.130> line<00:01:51.430> in

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
just going to make a black line in

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.690 
just going to make a black line in
between<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.900> red<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.380> green<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.490> it's

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
between the red and the green so it's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.490 
between the red and the green so it's
red<00:01:54.970> black<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.600> green<00:01:58.380> and<00:02:00.330> then<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.720> went<00:02:02.140> over

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
red black and green and then I went over

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.350 
red black and green and then I went over
that<00:02:02.979> black<00:02:03.340> line<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.850> was<00:02:03.940> connecting

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
that black line that was connecting

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.630 
that black line that was connecting
everything<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.500> yellow<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.220> fixed

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
everything with the yellow and I fixed

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.080 
everything with the yellow and I fixed
it<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.810> make<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.229> black<00:02:08.530> line<00:02:08.830> going<00:02:09.520> down<00:02:09.550> from

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
it to make a black line going down from

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.479 
it to make a black line going down from
the<00:02:10.209> very<00:02:10.420> corner<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.319> green<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.310> did

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the very corner of this green and I did

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.630 
the very corner of this green and I did
the<00:02:12.580> same<00:02:12.760> thing<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> other<00:02:13.209> side

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
the same thing on the other side

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.890 
the same thing on the other side
hopefully<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.760> makes<00:02:15.910> sense<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> doesn't

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
hopefully that makes sense if it doesn't

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.720 
hopefully that makes sense if it doesn't
it<00:02:17.800> doesn't<00:02:17.830> really<00:02:18.100> matter<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
it doesn't really matter because it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.540 
it doesn't really matter because it
didn't<00:02:18.970> make<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.450> difference<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.220> now

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
didn't make much of a difference so now

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.820 
didn't make much of a difference so now
on<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.180> middle<00:02:22.510> finger<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.080> used<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.500> very

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
on to the middle finger I used a very

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.229 
on to the middle finger I used a very
dark<00:02:24.160> blue<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.500> where<00:02:26.680> Martian<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
dark blue and this is where Martian the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.000 
dark blue and this is where Martian the
morning<00:02:28.570> Marvin<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> Martian<00:02:29.410> said<00:02:29.830> it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
morning Marvin the Martian said it's

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.009
