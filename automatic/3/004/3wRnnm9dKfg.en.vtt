struck a good balance between action and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
struck a good balance between action and
telling<00:01:08.939> story<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.630> good<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
issues focus too much on one or the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
issues focus too much on one or the
other<00:01:14.340> cuz<00:01:14.670> he<00:01:14.850> am<00:01:14.970> born<00:01:15.299> either<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.869> this
