00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
we had a great mentality going into

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.150 
we had a great mentality going into
Irvine<00:03:01.140> unfortunately<00:03:01.800> was<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.070> those

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
Irvine unfortunately was one of those

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.710 
Irvine unfortunately was one of those
days<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.580> did<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> lot<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.000> things<00:03:03.270> well<00:03:03.480> but

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
days we did a lot of things well but

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.600 
days we did a lot of things well but
didn't<00:03:03.990> finish<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.680> ultimately<00:03:05.310> you're

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
didn't finish and so ultimately you're

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.860 
didn't finish and so ultimately you're
gonna<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.850> judged<00:03:06.060> whether<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.450> score<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:06.810> not

and we had an early goal called back so

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.900 
and we had an early goal called back so

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
but the flag is up we got to see on the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.520 
but the flag is up we got to see on the
replay<00:03:17.400> probably<00:03:18.090> wasn't<00:03:18.360> offside<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.959> even

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
replay probably wasn't offside but even

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.410
