00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.569
 good guys and girls you know that 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.280
 windows 10 is already on the street and after the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.960
 launch of this windows 10 the new 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.740
 revision of the operating system of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 microsoft 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 larri known as major nelson we 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.609
 shows how to take advantage of one of the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.199
 designed system characteristics 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.570
 precisely for us for the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 gamers is about using the stream of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 xbox one games towards our pc is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 say from our pc we will be able to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 play xbox one games 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 obviously it's a stream will be 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 running in our xbox one but it's 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.329
 a more than interesting option is worth something 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 so to speak, similar to what I was doing 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 well then with playstation 4 in the case 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 of the sony tablets so to speak 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.629
 not good in this microsoft video illustrates 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 how to connect the xbox one console to a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.149
 pc with windows 10 and how to use the remote 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.270
 of the console to be able to play the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.100
 games the video is in English but it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.280
 shows step by step how to take advantage of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.040
 function all the users we can see 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 in this 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.600
 in this case how to use this function 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.550
 a function that I'm sure that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.590
 many of you are going to finish 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.450
 using because the truth is that it has 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.490
 pretty useful so to speak 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 imagine that you have a laptop with 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.750
 windows 10 in the living room you have the console 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.960
 in the room and you want to play in the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.630
 lounge for whatever it is worth then with 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.390
 this way you can do it you can play 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.160
 to your xbox one from the place in the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.450
 that you have the laptop and the truth is 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.570
 which is a more than interesting option 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.780
 something that had been requested a lot in 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 good in the case of xbox one since already 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.160
 you know that playstation 4 has that 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 Stream stream service with your tablets 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.650
 with playstation vita even and in this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.350
 good case because it's up to xbox one this 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.750
 advantage this utility that sure more 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 of one you use and you have 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.170
 tried 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.010
 gates 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.010
