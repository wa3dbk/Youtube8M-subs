there's<00:00:11.639> two<00:00:11.880> types<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.389> lime<00:00:12.690> standard

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
there's two types of lime standard

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.320 
there's two types of lime standard
agricultural<00:00:14.340> lime<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:14.759> comes<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.120> powder

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
agricultural lime which comes in powder

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
agricultural lime which comes in powder
form<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.100> pail<00:00:17.100> lime<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.550> comes<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
form and pail lime which comes in the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.700 
form and pail lime which comes in the
form<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.630> small<00:00:18.779> pellet<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.560> be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
form of a small pellet that can be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.980 
form of a small pellet that can be
easily<00:00:19.949> spread<00:00:20.490> by<00:00:20.820> pretty<00:00:21.090> much<00:00:21.240> any<00:00:21.480> type<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
easily spread by pretty much any type of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.650 
easily spread by pretty much any type of
seed<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.500> fertilizer<00:00:22.710> spreader<00:00:23.460> pail<00:00:24.449> lime

also<00:00:24.990> becomes<00:00:25.380> active<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> soil<00:00:26.490> more

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
also becomes active in the soil more

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.359 
also becomes active in the soil more
quickly<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.869> makes<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.230> ideal<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.650> food

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
quickly which makes it ideal for food
