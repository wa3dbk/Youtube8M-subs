 handle without believing a good this video what 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.000
 I do because one of my subscribers 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 he asked for it and well here is the solution 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 good as always the first thing 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
 we have to do is download the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 files that I will leave in the description 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 of the good video the first thing is to download 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 crack if they do not have it after 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 we went to download the to believe 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 jerusalem point rar which is the patch 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 for those who can not enter the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 city of jerusalem or they are left 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.899
 hung the game when they do too 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 I leave the patch to believe fix 2 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.950
 arthur that serves so that the game does not 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 you get stuck at the time of entering 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
 this area one thing when installing the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 patches will erase your data from 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 game to say its knows game to avoid that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
 just make a backup of the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.010
 file or folder the truth is not me 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.809
 agreement that was called knows game and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.670
 after installing the patches the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 put back in place and ready not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.449
 they will have to go through the experience of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.969
 good data loss and now 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 let's start with the installation sorry for 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.840
 do not put video but at this moment 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 I have the game if for something in some 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 part are lost replay the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.940
 video 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 they do not understand anyway go to the post 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.740
 where I take out all of which I'll leave 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the links of the video well let's start 1 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 let's install 'assassin's creed' 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 normally 2 now we have to install 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 first the crack unzip the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 file that contains it in a folder 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 that is easily accessible to us immediately 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.700
 we went to the patch folder 102 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 where we will see an executable file 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.350
 point let's click to this file to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 see a window whose progress bar 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 will advance automatically as the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 update is installed in a matter of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 few seconds tip the patch that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.410
 will install will update the game to the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.450
 version 102 that's why they should not 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.340
 copy or paste any file up 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 they have not updated the game 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 before it is also to remind you that the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.690
 update can be carried out 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.180
 having the internet connected 3 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.490
 updated the game we return to our 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.380
 crack folder we select and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.869
 we copied two files 'assassin's creed' 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 of x 9 point excel 'assassin's creed' 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.180
 dx10 exe then we go to the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.530
 folder where the game was installed 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.380
 usually in cear 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.660
 of program ubisoft 'assassin's creed' 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.200
 to paste them and thus finish applying 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.880
 the crack 4 downloaded the fix is bar 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 patches of arthur and jerusalem 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.230
 now we have to solve this problem that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.260
 is formed every time we try to access 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.510
 both maps of the game will suffice 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.670
 click on for example the fix the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.739
 jerusalem where we will see a picture of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.739
 dialogue that will ask us the location 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.080
 of the files to decompress when doing 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.209
 click on extract a bar will be displayed 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.780
 of progress which will be completed in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.880
 a few minutes 5 decompressed the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.280
 Files of the fix is bar patches 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.620
 now we will select only three of 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.850
 those files data point for g data 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.530
 cards punto for haiti jerusalem punto kg 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 tip they may lose some of the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.819
 progress of the game when applying those fix 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.970
 it's mostly when you replace the first 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.650
 file mentioned in sum if they substitute 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
 the files that are not the three 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 mentioned in the previous paragraph the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.760
 game will not run because no 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.160
 correspond to version 102 which is 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 exactly the installed update 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.830
 step 26 selected such files 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.350
 now it will be enough to copy and paste them 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.870
 right in the folder where it was installed 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.300
 'assassin's creed' when the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.370
 dialog box accept the replacement 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.290
 of the dot files now enter the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.720
 game and approximate the entrance that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.090
 leads directly to jerusalem and ready and no 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.100
 the good game will be hung on my part 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.080
 that's all if something did not work out 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.270
