00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello I'm daniel the free android and today 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.620
 we are here with the video review of 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.000
 nexus 4 a new google phone 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.490
 which has already become the object of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.760
 I desire and saw how when he came to 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.130
 sale in the google play store sold out 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.009
 in just a few minutes only 10 minutes 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.700
 and we had practically stayed 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.670
 without units 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.680
 and is that its price so low 299 euros 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.000
 as a high- end terminal is a whole 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.370
 revolution in the market of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.590
 smartphones 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.680
 let's start with the outside of 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.300
 this nexus 4 phone we can find 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.990
 the power button on the part 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.660
 top right possibly the best 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.700
 site since it is very easy to access the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.560
 power button with the big toe a 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.190
 very natural simple pulsation of the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.079
 hand 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.930
 the left part we have the buttons 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.129
 to raise and lower volume and slot 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.739
 of the micro if maybe one of the worst 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.899
 things from the outside as there are 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.449
 that to get it out and put it in, we have 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.180
 to use a small key that comes to us 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.650
 with the phone that if we lose 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.150
 it can complicate our lives a bit 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.330
 because the slot is downright small 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 the microusb port is in the part 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.760
 later where will we charge 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 we can connect the computer to 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.390
 phone and finally we have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.760
 the entrance 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.909
 already for the headphones in the part 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.909
 higher 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.200
 one of the curiosities of the phone is 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.110
 that not only the front is with 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 gorilla glass but also the part 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.920
 later we find here one thing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.900
 quite interesting in the nexus picture 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.020
 and is that the camera is covered with 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 same gorillas that protects the whole part 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.990
 later this has two problems for 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.670
 one side if the glass gorilla breaks and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.550
 is that we already know that the crystal is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.110
 quite prone to break is what 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.650
 have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.330
 is that he is also covering the camera 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.090
 then when covering the camera if 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.710
 it breaks and a crack appears, it will leave us 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.070
 with the camera totally unusable 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.520
 besides this crystal is not a crystal 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.750
 photographic and when covering the lens can 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.370
 make it one of the small problems 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.170
 which causes the camera to be in which the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.200
 box is not as powerful as its 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.690
 competitors 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 besides that glass in the part 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.530
 posterior does not have any kind of grip 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.200
 so when we have it on a 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.660
 flat surface is very easy to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.580
 slide 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.020
 in fact until it becomes a great 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.300
 problem in certain circumstances 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.840
 when the surface is slightly 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.910
 inclined 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.950
 nevertheless have taken great care the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.920
 details and we can see that kind of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.730
 hologram on the back 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.300
 frankly it looks very good 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.490
 [Music] 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.850
 and aesthetically it's a very telephone 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.850
 beautiful 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.010
 the first thing we notice when we turn on 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.950
 the nexus 4 is the interface an interface 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.620
 of Android 4.2 and the living in the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.110
 unlock screen we have new 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.640
 accesses where we can add 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.549
 widgets we can move through the 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.849
 screens and this direct access to the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.989
 very comfortable camera that only loses certain 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:35.020
 part that this link 4 does not have a button 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.720
 Direct access to the camera 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.740
 from the main screen we noticed 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.290
 mostly speed the phone 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.480
 it works perfectly it is very fast 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.489
 in that sense android is one of the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.829
 more evolutionary steps bigger 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.200
 evolutionarily speaking with jelly well and 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.130
 is that it certainly works very very 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.720
 Quick 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.880
 an interesting detail that we found 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.460
 is a shortcut from the bar 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.010
 notifications to the adjustments we can 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.450
 enter different customizations 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.460
 wifi or airplane direct brightness settings 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 directly from there though one way 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.470
 simpler still to access is through 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.570
 a movement with two fingers in which 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.570
 directly we enter the screen 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.670
 but not only that has also improved 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.290
 a lot of the camera 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.480
 It seems a lie that no one would have 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.670
 happened this before but with a simple 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.890
 a simple click on the screen 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.440
 we can have direct access to 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.170
 settings 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.200
 change we enter to face the back 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.950
 activate the hdr mode change the mode of 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.950
 flash we want 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.380
 go through the exhibition colors 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.070
 or any other type of adjustment 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.200
 really comfortable and a great success in 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.530
 this letters interface box of the 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.530
 camera 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.800
 the quality of the camera is good is not 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 excellent but good improves the previous 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.160
 nexus the galaxy nexus and although it is not 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.690
 the best and their competitors are 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.009
 clearly ahead of him as the 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.270
 galaxy s3 or the htc 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.810
 word x plus 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.390
 but it's a decent camera to achieve good 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.120
 results in macro mode and with little 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.070
 light but as I say it's still a bit 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.690
 behind 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.480
 connectivity has also been taken care of 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.150
 much 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.990
 we can find of course wifi 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.990
 bluetooth 4.0 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.630
 the sc and android pib good lfc we enter 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.330
 in the battle of always a technology 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.980
 that is increasingly used but it does not come from 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.160
 all smartphones although it starts already 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.360
 to be key because the banks 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.100
 credit cards begin to 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.500
 incorporate it and from there it will be 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.500
 where we will see that more sites arrived 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.990
 in your processor snapdragon s4 pro to 15 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.300
 gigahertz and the 2 gigas of ram 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.550
 internal that have this in 64 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.550
 they confirm a very high speed a 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.080
 extraordinary performance level 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.450
 frankly I had never used a 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.380
 Android phone that worked so 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.870
 fast answer too 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.090
 and ultimately give us a result 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.630
 as good as we got with is having 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.260
 his pictures really amazing 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.360
 as in yale and pin 4.1 also in 4.2 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.770
 we found google now although in Spain 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.680
 still not working too much 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.750
 but some cards do work 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.110
 well we can find information like 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.110
 the time 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.050
 in short, our four are 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.410
 before a clearly high-end terminal 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.450
 with very good features and a 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.000
 price that bursts completely the 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:03.120
 Market never seen before is worth it 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.260
 buy it probably yes and surely 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.370
 we are talking about the android that more 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.500
 profitable is now that better 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.900
 value for money has but 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.000
 certain details do that if we look 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.480
 a phone for some things like 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.030
 it can be music quality photography 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.150
 sound quality is going to be a 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.810
 little behind otherwise the 34 is 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.450
 a great android possibly as I said 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.010
 the best in value for money 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.590
 thank you very much for watching this review of 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.580
 free android and see you in the 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.580
 free dotcom android
