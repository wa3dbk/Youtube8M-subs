00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.610 

so<00:02:04.370> like<00:02:04.730> I<00:02:04.850> said<00:02:04.910> we<00:02:05.360> need<00:02:05.690> two<00:02:06.200> tablespoons

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620

of<00:02:06.890> pepper<00:02:07.990> drop<00:02:08.990> off<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.200> little<00:02:09.440> piece<00:02:09.560> right

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
of pepper drop off a little piece right

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.350 
of pepper drop off a little piece right
here<00:02:10.180> we're<00:02:11.180> going<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.420> chop<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:13.360> smells

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
here we're going to chop it smells

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:29.230 
here we're going to chop it smells
really<00:02:14.480> good<00:02:14.840> actually

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:40.950 

there<00:02:29.930> may<00:02:30.050> be<00:02:30.080> really<00:02:30.590> smaller<00:02:34.330> small<00:02:35.330> fish

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.540 

so<00:02:41.960> we<00:02:42.080> probably<00:02:42.290> already<00:02:42.530> had<00:02:42.890> more<00:02:43.160> than<00:02:43.190> we

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
so we probably already had more than we

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:54.550 
so we probably already had more than we
need<00:02:43.580> right<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:52.720> actually<00:02:53.720> might<00:02:54.200> want<00:02:54.440> to

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.910 

we're<00:05:56.480> going<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.720> set<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.350> oven<00:05:57.380> we're
