00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 speaks very good boy of the catalog and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.390
 I hope that I am black or and here 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 we are a video more and it touches us with 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 fourth under 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 I wanted to make this little video for 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.579
 show that I'm using the time 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 because I know that maybe there are people who 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.690
 that would emulate so that but not that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.720
 this type of games is not played if not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.510
 you have digital and then 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.790
 I'm going to make it clear, I have a site 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.160
 which is 52 but I'm very fond of 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.380
 aviation simulators for some time 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 time but in this game they have gone 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.010
 the hand simplifying the controls for 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.490
 the mouse and in fact I'm using the 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.440
 mouse because they represent an advantage for 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.100
 over the joystick unlike how 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.260
 have traditionally been in the games 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.050
 of aerial simulation and well I'm going to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.870
 explain a bit in the controls so that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.970
 you make the idea and good if you want 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.800
 playing with a mouse does not just work 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.170
 well with mice that work best with 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.150
 mouse that with the joystick and good we go 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 to prove it is that simple 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.990
 basically we have our 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.530
 cursor that is the circle this white what 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.540
 you see here I move it is worth the cursor is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.700
 towards where we point the cursor 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.090
 to bring up the plane the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 game now 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 they will move the controls as needed 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.570
 to run the plane next to that point 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.009
 as long as the conditions are given 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 for example if we point upwards and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.120
 we were impotent the plane falls 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.190
 and can not or will not go there or be 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.190
 You understand me 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.710
 Well, you can control completely 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.310
 the plane only with a mouse crossing to the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.570
 sides down up and as 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.860
 you can see in the game will always direct 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.300
 the plane where the cursor is pointing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 now at the time of aiming for 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690
 shoot then it becomes a complete 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729
 advantage because I simply put the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.260
 cursor already on a site and the plane will try 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.180
 to go there we do not have the little ones 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.310
 adjustments that are leaving us a little bit 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.770
 happens we are short as when we 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.240
 happens with the joystick well now the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.800
 advantage of the clear joystick is that the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.910
 johnny we have more control over the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.470
 commands and we can do maneuvers 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.150
 closed good, you'll see here too 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.010
 we have the maneuvers closed first 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.070
 in the wikileaks key 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.710
 we have emergency power and 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.150
 we raise power or if you're already at a hundred 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.060
 percent as we move to the power of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.490
 emergency with the saw key we go down 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 power up on the left we have 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.090
 our acceleration indicator of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.760
 power you can see wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.860
 wiki wiki wiki see 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.660
 we can go adjusting the power to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.680
 level at this time I'm going to 72 for 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.099
 hundred to the level that I want 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.859
 we return to 100% then that with the key 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.769
 wiki wiki we control the engine then 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.319
 with the quebec and echo key we control the 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.500
 rudder as you can see point that 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.200
 means last to the left and 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.060
 to the right respectively then 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.400
 with the alpha and delta keys we have the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.300
 Ailerons in which we can make 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.320
 turn maneuvers until 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.510
 the left as the right 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.250
 respectively and then on the key 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.730
 upper case and control with upper case 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.860
 we have ailerons down which 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.440
 cause it to lower the nose and found the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 elevator spoiler that went in an elevator 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.920
 elevator up then what 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.480
 does this mean that if we 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
 we need to do a closed maneuver 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.430
 we rotate the one that we have elevator and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.520
 we make our maneuver closed with 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.380
 keys 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.270
 and at the moment that we have a 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.450
 goal then let go of the keys and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.130
 We have the precision and the smoothness for 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.400
 the mouse 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.110
 well then without more 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.650
 let's see if it does not come out then 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.650
 starting a decent game with only 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.329
 with just a mouse, I wanted to show that 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.709
 If you are encouraged and good what you 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.299
 I cut a little bit new that I'm not from 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.640
 simulators and I do not have a while a 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.220
 good youtube not forget you because I have 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.380
 is not designed to be played with a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.729
 mouse fact you're already telling me my 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.430
 friends who are a traitor such 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.710
 lacking the same purist friend and good is 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.930
 that we always use joystick and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.280
 at least removed we always use you 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.039
 because it's supposed to represent a 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.110
 advantage playing with 10 and for over 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.300
 people who do not have it go on like this is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.650
 a prize for the people who arrive 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.590
 further in the tribulation 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.780
 but if in this case the advantage is with 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.509
 the mouse or if it gives us more people 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.699
 they are going to have an advantage over me and 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.289
 I have my hands on the instrument 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.449
 the hardware that I give them is an advantage 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.810
 and I do not want to use it as a purist 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.460
 then it would be a bit silly 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.570
 let's see if we get caught this 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.570
 bomber with the cannon 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.690
 I hate hate the Japanese as they tell 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.690
 hosts 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.110
 Come on, but your mother's son falls 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.030
 what better than not all 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.030
 we go for the second time burned down 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.250
 at last 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 Hello 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.579
 that I had been shooting until the last 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:37.609
 moment we recharge we take advantage of that 

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:40.429
 we had a moment of pause yes yes yes 

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:42.259
 in this game reload well that we go to 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:44.359
 egg has very realistic sensations and 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.849
 such but come on you always have a top 

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:50.029
 create every 2 or 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.619
 it's not my fault the merchant's fault 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.619
 let's go the bussines business 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.050
 well let's see how we are winning by 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.510
 little bit but we're winning a puzzle 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.380
 curry hate what happens does not happen they are very 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.240
 very strong and they have 44 cannons that 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.240
 they have some firecrackers that glasses 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.850
 then he gave a lot to the spirits fair 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.010
 pizza are not strong that's nothing 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.740
 they break but god as maneuver and how 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.460
 they stick too 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.240
 the jurist capturing we did not stop him 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.240
 we came late 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.710
 well let's say at least not 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.710
 let's have 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.630

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.630

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.490
 around the world 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.120
 for coming to kill me
