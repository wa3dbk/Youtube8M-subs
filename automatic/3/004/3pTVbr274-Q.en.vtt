00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
off and on the head me I don't know it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.410 
off and on the head me I don't know it
just<00:04:01.840> feels<00:04:02.110> like<00:04:02.350> those<00:04:03.150> butts<00:04:04.150> where<00:04:04.330> the

just feels like those butts where the
actual<00:04:04.600> headphones<00:04:05.470> are<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:06.340> few<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:07.480> I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
actual headphones are the few like I

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.380 
actual headphones are the few like I
said<00:04:07.750> loosen<00:04:08.380> kind<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.770> weakened<00:04:09.670> not

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
said loosen kind of weakened not

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.580 
said loosen kind of weakened not
necessarily<00:04:10.990> cheap<00:04:11.320> but<00:04:11.770> they<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.250> feel

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
necessarily cheap but they just feel

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.340 
necessarily cheap but they just feel
easily<00:04:14.590> snap<00:04:14.860> aboard<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.340> worry<00:04:15.670> that

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
easily snap aboard I worry that

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.479 
easily snap aboard I worry that
depending<00:04:17.350> on<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.500> situation<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:18.310> they<00:04:18.430> were

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
depending on the situation if they were

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.659 
depending on the situation if they were
taking<00:04:18.820> off<00:04:18.940> very<00:04:19.410> exuberantly<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:21.520> they

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
taking off very exuberantly that they

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.250 
taking off very exuberantly that they
may<00:04:22.030> actually<00:04:22.270> snap

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
may actually snap

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.530 
may actually snap
just<00:04:23.500> my<00:04:23.680> feeling<00:04:24.250> they<00:04:24.490> could<00:04:24.700> be<00:04:24.820> strong<00:04:25.270> as

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
just my feeling they could be strong as

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.500 
just my feeling they could be strong as
I<00:04:25.780> don't<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.290> weapons-grade<00:04:26.760> titanium<00:04:27.760> but

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
I don't know weapons-grade titanium but

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.470 
I don't know weapons-grade titanium but
it<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:28.960> feels<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.560> me<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> little<00:04:29.890> loose<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:31.210> I

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
it just feels to me a little loose and I

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.650 
it just feels to me a little loose and I

need the headphone that defeats the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.600 
need the headphone that defeats the
purpose<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.930> being<00:05:20.170> a<00:05:20.260> headset<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:21.220> I

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
purpose of it being a headset and I

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.160 
purpose of it being a headset and I
don't<00:05:21.850> need<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.270> microphone<00:05:22.630> as<00:05:22.960> such

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
don't need the microphone as such

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.740 
don't need the microphone as such
obviously<00:05:23.680> because<00:05:23.950> I've<00:05:24.130> got<00:05:24.400> aa<00:05:24.750> standalone

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
obviously because I've got aa standalone

obviously because I've got aa standalone
condenser<00:05:26.620> mic<00:05:26.830> but<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.370> fact<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.670> it<00:05:27.880> does

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
condenser mic but the fact that it does

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.640 
condenser mic but the fact that it does
give<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.900> option<00:05:29.200> of<00:05:29.260> USB<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.450> audio

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
give you the option of USB and audio

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.620 
give you the option of USB and audio
jacks<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.980> very<00:05:33.310> good<00:05:33.490> because<00:05:33.790> if<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.150> didn't

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
jacks is very good because if I didn't

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.150 
jacks is very good because if I didn't
have<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:34.810> microphone<00:05:35.410> then<00:05:35.920> I<00:05:35.980> could<00:05:36.130> just

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
have that microphone then I could just

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.220 
have that microphone then I could just
plug<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.520> into<00:05:36.700> you<00:05:36.940> USB<00:05:37.270> but<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.960> way<00:05:38.050> my

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
plug it into you USB but the way my

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.780 
plug it into you USB but the way my
microphone<00:05:38.650> works<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.980> plug<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.370> headset

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790

microphone works you plug the headset
into<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:40.480> via<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:41.050> jack<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:42.160> for<00:05:42.610> me<00:05:42.730> that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
into it via the jack so for me that

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.090 
into it via the jack so for me that
works<00:05:43.210> perfectly<00:05:43.720> obviously<00:05:44.380> I<00:05:44.410> will<00:05:44.710> not<00:05:44.950> be

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.900 
compromise because obviously if you want
ultimate<00:06:26.230> quality<00:06:26.500> then<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.490> are<00:06:27.640> going<00:06:27.820> to

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
ultimate quality then you are going to

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.620 
ultimate quality then you are going to
be<00:06:28.000> paying<00:06:28.330> a<00:06:28.540> lot<00:06:29.700> but<00:06:30.700> if<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:31.030> don't<00:06:31.270> want

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
be paying a lot but if you don't want

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.350 
be paying a lot but if you don't want
like<00:06:32.380> if<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.620> want<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:33.580> pay<00:06:33.910> I<00:06:33.940> don't<00:06:34.150> know

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
like if you want to pay I don't know

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.760 
like if you want to pay I don't know
five<00:06:34.720> pounds<00:06:35.080> and<00:06:35.230> you're<00:06:35.410> not<00:06:35.500> going<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.680> get

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
five pounds and you're not going to get

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.870 
five pounds and you're not going to get
very<00:06:36.010> much<00:06:36.310> quality

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
very much quality

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.550 
very much quality
at<00:06:36.940> all<00:06:37.120> so<00:06:37.390> I<00:06:37.600> say<00:06:37.990> this<00:06:38.140> is<00:06:38.260> a<00:06:38.290> good

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
at all so I say this is a good

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.410 
at all so I say this is a good
compromise<00:06:38.800> in<00:06:39.250> both<00:06:39.400> price<00:06:39.760> and<00:06:39.790> quality

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
compromise in both price and quality

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.930 
compromise in both price and quality
it's<00:06:41.170> more<00:06:41.500> quality<00:06:41.950> than<00:06:42.160> I'd<00:06:42.340> be<00:06:42.490> expected

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
it's more quality than I'd be expected

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.440 
it's more quality than I'd be expected
for<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.150> price<00:06:43.360> by<00:06:43.900> the<00:06:43.930> same<00:06:44.170> time<00:06:44.380> it's<00:06:44.620> not

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
for the price by the same time it's not

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.320 
for the price by the same time it's not
like<00:06:46.450> cheap<00:06:47.350> and<00:06:47.560> nasty<00:06:47.770> it's<00:06:48.190> it's<00:06:49.150> a<00:06:49.240> good

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
like cheap and nasty it's it's a good

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.760
