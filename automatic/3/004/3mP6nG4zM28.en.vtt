microphone<00:04:18.739> lightning<00:04:19.599> connector<00:04:20.599> it<00:04:21.590> will

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
microphone lightning connector it will

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.860 
microphone lightning connector it will
work<00:04:22.250> with

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
work with

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.810 
work with
most<00:04:23.050> third-party<00:04:23.830> connectors<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.430> think<00:04:24.669> I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
most third-party connectors I think I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.550 
most third-party connectors I think I
don't<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:25.150> any<00:04:25.210> but<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.720> mean<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.440> guys

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
don't have any but I mean if you guys

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.740 
don't have any but I mean if you guys
look<00:04:26.770> at<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:26.949> it's<00:04:27.250> pretty<00:04:27.520> big<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:27.970> it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
look at it it's pretty big so it

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.040 
look at it it's pretty big so it
probably<00:04:29.380> isn't<00:04:29.710> any<00:04:29.800> problem<00:04:32.699> for<00:04:33.699> me<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.210> I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
probably isn't any problem for me I I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.740 
probably isn't any problem for me I I
think<00:04:35.470> this<00:04:35.979> case<00:04:36.160> is<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> great<00:04:36.580> design<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.389> is

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
think this case is a great design it is

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.439 
think this case is a great design it is
a<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.590> very<00:04:39.130> protective<00:04:39.400> case<00:04:39.850> I've<00:04:40.090> dropped

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
a very very protective case I've dropped

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.560 
a very very protective case I've dropped
it<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.750> couple<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.080> times<00:04:41.350> not<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:41.770> purpose<00:04:42.280> and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
it a couple of times not on purpose and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.270 
it a couple of times not on purpose and
I<00:04:43.570> mean<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:43.990> always<00:04:44.139> came<00:04:44.500> out<00:04:44.650> pretty<00:04:44.830> good<00:04:45.010> my

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
I mean it always came out pretty good my

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.760 
I mean it always came out pretty good my
phone<00:04:45.550> still<00:04:45.940> looks<00:04:46.240> as<00:04:46.449> new<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.290> that's<00:04:47.500> good

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
phone still looks as new so that's good

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.490 
phone still looks as new so that's good
and<00:04:47.979> actually<00:04:48.639> speaking<00:04:49.389> claims<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.290> it's

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
and actually speaking claims that it's

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500 
and actually speaking claims that it's
as<00:04:50.710> protective<00:04:51.460> as<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.880> OtterBox<00:04:52.389> Defender

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
as protective as the OtterBox Defender

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.620 
as protective as the OtterBox Defender
and<00:04:53.229> they<00:04:53.800> use<00:04:53.979> slogan<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.729> it's<00:04:55.090> based<00:04:55.389> on<00:04:55.570> a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
and they use slogan that it's based on a

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.800 
and they use slogan that it's based on a
phone<00:04:56.020> not<00:04:56.560> on<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.860> box<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.479> was<00:04:58.600> pretty

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
phone not on a box so it was pretty

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.790 
phone not on a box so it was pretty
funny

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
funny

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.270 
funny
and<00:05:00.630> actually<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:02.320> well<00:05:03.190> until<00:05:03.550> now<00:05:03.760> it<00:05:04.060> really

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
and actually I well until now it really

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.490 
and actually I well until now it really
stands<00:05:06.280> up<00:05:06.370> pretty<00:05:06.789> well<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.750> slogan<00:05:08.169> so

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
stands up pretty well to that slogan so

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.409 
stands up pretty well to that slogan so
I'm<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.100> happy<00:05:09.340> with<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.760> case<00:05:10.000> it's<00:05:10.270> my
