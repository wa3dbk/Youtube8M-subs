get off and how to learn to ride so
here's<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> step<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.430> could<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> step

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
here's the step you could use a step

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.970 
here's the step you could use a step
four<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> front<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.430> house<00:00:24.980> make

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
four in the front of your house make

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.410 
four in the front of your house make
sure<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.310> pedals<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:28.490> parallel<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:32.420> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
sure the pedals are parallel and you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
sure the pedals are parallel and you
want<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> step<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> pedal<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.309> presses

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
want to step on the pedal that presses

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.780 
want to step on the pedal that presses
up<00:00:36.000> against<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> step<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:39.930> time

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
up against the step and the first time

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.029 
up against the step and the first time
just<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:47.270> when<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.039> at

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
just go over now when you do that at

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
just go over now when you do that at
some<00:00:50.520> point<00:00:52.670> you'll<00:00:53.670> feel<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> weight<00:00:54.480> your

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.289 

that's<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> point<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> balance<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:05.150> notice<00:01:06.150> I

that's the point of balance you notice I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
that's the point of balance you notice I
pause<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> middle<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.650> step

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
you're using it to balance so find some

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.080 
you're using it to balance so find some
place<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.849> hold<00:03:36.060> on

step on the rear pedal step on the front

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:52.949 
step on the rear pedal step on the front
pedal<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.939> take<00:03:44.939> off

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.740 

and<00:03:53.049> that's<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.790> rest<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.239> practiced<00:03:57.750> at

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and that's it the rest is practiced at

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.179 
and that's it the rest is practiced at
the<00:03:58.900> end<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.170> first<00:03:59.439> day<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.709> could<00:04:00.069> go

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
the end of the first day I could go

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.720 
the end of the first day I could go
about<00:04:00.370> 50<00:04:00.849> feet<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.159> end<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.489> first

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
about 50 feet at the end of the first

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.959 
about 50 feet at the end of the first
week<00:04:04.890> about<00:04:05.890> two<00:04:06.069> hundred<00:04:06.159> and<00:04:06.430> fifty<00:04:06.730> feet

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:06.969 
week about two hundred and fifty feet

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.300 
week about two hundred and fifty feet
and<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.390> was<00:04:07.890> practicing<00:04:08.890> for<00:04:08.920> about<00:04:09.189> an

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
and that was practicing for about an

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.400 
and that was practicing for about an
hour<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.609> day<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:15.570> within<00:04:16.570> about<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.870> month<00:04:17.169> or

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
hour a day and within about a month or

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.939 
hour a day and within about a month or
two<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.560> could<00:04:17.739> go<00:04:17.979> several<00:04:18.340> miles<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.799> got

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
two I could go several miles but you got

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.810 
two I could go several miles but you got
to<00:04:21.070> practice<00:04:21.220> every<00:04:21.699> day<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:23.550> that's<00:04:24.550> it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
to practice every day and that's it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.670 
to practice every day and that's it
all<00:04:27.820> right<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.699> on<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.940> unicycle<00:04:34.680> find

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
all right so to get on the unicycle find

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.420 
all right so to get on the unicycle find
a<00:04:35.860> step<00:04:36.160> initially<00:04:37.080> make<00:04:38.080> sure<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.500> pedals

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
a step initially make sure the pedals

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.070 
a step initially make sure the pedals
are<00:04:39.610> parallel<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.360> ground<00:04:42.599> hold<00:04:43.599> on<00:04:43.810> to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
are parallel to the ground hold on to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770 
are parallel to the ground hold on to
something<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.740> can<00:04:45.030> adjust<00:04:46.030> yourself<00:04:46.210> in

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
something so you can adjust yourself in

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.280 
something so you can adjust yourself in
the<00:04:47.530> seat<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.840> then<00:04:49.840> push<00:04:50.110> off

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.100 

make<00:04:55.920> sure<00:04:56.100> your<00:04:56.340> arms<00:04:56.880> are<00:04:57.060> out<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.930> can

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
make sure your arms are out so you can

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:08.270 
make sure your arms are out so you can
balance<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:04.380> may<00:05:04.560> find<00:05:06.440> it's<00:05:07.440> easier<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:08.070> turn

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
balance you may find it's easier to turn

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:19.210 
balance you may find it's easier to turn
in<00:05:08.490> one<00:05:08.670> direction<00:05:08.850> than<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.390> other
