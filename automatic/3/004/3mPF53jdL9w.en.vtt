all<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.020> basic<00:03:28.470> ones<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:29.250> just<00:03:29.430> basically

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
all the basic ones that just basically

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.530 
all the basic ones that just basically
add<00:03:30.060> damage<00:03:30.570> or<00:03:30.780> decrease<00:03:31.680> your<00:03:32.370> stamina<00:03:33.120> loss

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
add damage or decrease your stamina loss

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 
because of damage just all the basic
stuff<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.090> that's<00:03:36.480> my<00:03:36.630> first<00:03:36.870> game<00:03:37.110> plan<00:03:37.320> you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
stuff and that's my first game plan you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.720 
stuff and that's my first game plan you
can<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.620> three<00:03:37.830> different<00:03:38.010> game<00:03:38.280> plans<00:03:38.580> that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
can have three different game plans that

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.010 
can have three different game plans that
switch<00:03:38.880> between<00:03:39.090> them<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.570> which<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.810> think

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
switch between them to which I think

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.900 
switch between them to which I think
it's<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.410> cool<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.920> decided<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.760> mess

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
it's really cool I decided not to mess

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.490 
it's really cool I decided not to mess
with<00:03:41.970> any<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.360> moves<00:03:42.600> or<00:03:42.750> animations<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
with any of the moves or animations and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.410 
with any of the moves or animations and
the<00:03:43.920> last<00:03:44.130> thing<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.580> looks<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the last thing it looks like the the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.090 
the last thing it looks like the the
attributes<00:03:45.960> that<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.410> could<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.710> put<00:03:46.950> them

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
attributes that you could just put them

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.560 
attributes that you could just put them
up<00:03:47.250> however<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.610> want<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:48.180> don't<00:03:48.360> know<00:03:48.480> if

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
up however you want I don't know if

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.940 
up however you want I don't know if
there's<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.810> cost<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> couldn't<00:03:49.830> really

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
there's a cost there I couldn't really

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550 
there's a cost there I couldn't really
see<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.850> was<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.210> little<00:03:51.420> bit<00:03:51.510> confusing<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.170> at

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
see I was a little bit confusing but at

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.780 
see I was a little bit confusing but at
the<00:03:52.740> end<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.980> day<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.130> did<00:03:53.340> enjoy<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.640> up

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the end of the day I did enjoy it up

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.250 
the end of the day I did enjoy it up
decided<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.210> put<00:03:54.330> my<00:03:54.450> power<00:03:54.660> up<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.140> little

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
decided to put my power up just a little

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.500
