a couple small benefits but as for your
foot<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.820> means<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
foot what that means is you really get a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.070 
foot what that means is you really get a
good<00:02:25.800> sense<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> ground<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.780> I've

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
good sense of the ground and I know I've

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830 
good sense of the ground and I know I've
spoken<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.580> runners<00:02:30.060> they've<00:02:30.630> had

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
spoken with a lot of runners they've had

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
spoken with a lot of runners they've had
difficulty<00:02:31.910> with<00:02:32.910> stress<00:02:33.390> fractures<00:02:34.370> sore

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
difficulty with stress fractures sore

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.650 
difficulty with stress fractures sore
muscles<00:02:37.280> what's<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.490> other<00:02:38.610> one

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.140 

shin<00:02:42.660> splints<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> list<00:02:43.860> goes<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
shin splints the list goes on and on and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.200 
shin splints the list goes on and on and
a<00:02:45.450> lot<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.260> caused<00:02:46.830> by<00:02:47.700> striking

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
a lot of that can be caused by striking

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.150 
a lot of that can be caused by striking
the<00:02:48.450> ground<00:02:48.570> too<00:02:49.170> hard<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:49.710> you're<00:02:49.890> running

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the ground too hard when you're running

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.120 
the ground too hard when you're running
well<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.210> get<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> better<00:02:51.950> sensation<00:02:52.950> of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the ground a better tactile sensation

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.370 
the ground a better tactile sensation
through<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.190> bottom<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.940> your<00:02:57.120> foot<00:02:57.450> what

through the bottom of your foot what

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.400 
through the bottom of your foot what
that<00:02:58.560> means<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.670> becomes<00:03:00.210> painful<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
that means is it becomes painful to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.430 
that means is it becomes painful to
strike<00:03:01.770> incorrectly<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.570> these<00:03:03.810> shoes<00:03:04.230> are

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
strike incorrectly so these shoes are

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.820 
strike incorrectly so these shoes are
supposed<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.040> provide<00:03:05.550> an<00:03:05.700> excellent

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
sensation of the ground and what that

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.520 
sensation of the ground and what that
means<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.870> you'll<00:03:12.870> stand<00:03:13.200> less<00:03:13.500> a

chance of getting shin splints stress

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.960 
chance of getting shin splints stress
fractures<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.830> list<00:03:17.040> goes<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.880> on

another<00:03:18.930> thing<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> mean<00:03:19.800> your<00:03:19.950> toes<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.520> splay

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
another thing I mean your toes can splay

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.350 
another thing I mean your toes can splay
out<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.750> zero<00:03:22.080> drop<00:03:22.670> meaning<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
out it's a zero drop meaning it is the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.810 
out it's a zero drop meaning it is the
same<00:03:24.690> height<00:03:24.990> at<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.440> heel<00:03:25.770> as<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.160> ball<00:03:26.490> of

same height at the heel as the ball of
the<00:03:27.000> foot<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.540> could<00:03:28.110> go<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.320> forever<00:03:28.860> about
