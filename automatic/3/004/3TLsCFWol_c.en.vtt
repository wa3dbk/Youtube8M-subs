00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
bad weapons had to be left out of this

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.060 
bad weapons had to be left out of this
top-10<00:00:34.789> but<00:00:35.690> as<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.019> said<00:00:36.260> I<00:00:36.289> try<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.680> choose<00:00:37.010> the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
top-10 but as I said I try to choose the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.939 
top-10 but as I said I try to choose the
worst<00:00:37.809> in<00:00:38.809> my<00:00:39.530> opinion<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.989> so<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.350> first<00:00:42.649> one

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
worst in my opinion and so the first one

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.310 
worst in my opinion and so the first one
that<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.340> have<00:00:43.460> right<00:00:43.940> here<00:00:43.969> is<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:44.750> on<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.079> top

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
that I have right here is not on the top

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.500 
that I have right here is not on the top
10<00:00:45.589> but<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:45.920> decided<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.429> put<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.730> here<00:00:47.059> as<00:00:47.239> like

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
10 but I decided to put it here as like

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.529 
10 but I decided to put it here as like
a<00:00:47.620> nobleman<00:00:48.620> ssin<00:00:48.949> because<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:50.359> that

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
a nobleman ssin because I think that

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.869 
a nobleman ssin because I think that
it's<00:00:50.719> bad<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:51.710> at<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.920> same<00:00:52.100> time<00:00:52.339> it's<00:00:52.579> good

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
it's bad but at the same time it's good

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.000 
it's bad but at the same time it's good
and<00:00:53.120> that's<00:00:53.510> why<00:00:53.749> it's<00:00:54.019> not<00:00:54.230> on<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.499> top<00:00:54.739> ten

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
and that's why it's not on the top ten

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.299 
and that's why it's not on the top ten
and<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:55.370> weapon<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.809> flamethrower<00:00:57.679> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
and that weapon is the flamethrower the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.189 
and that weapon is the flamethrower the
flamethrower<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.179> bad<00:00:59.539> weapon<00:00:59.809> in<00:01:00.050> my

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
flamethrower is a bad weapon in my

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.829 
flamethrower is a bad weapon in my
opinion<00:01:00.589> because<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.920> kills<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.670> slowly<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
opinion because it kills to slowly it

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.370 
opinion because it kills to slowly it
has<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:04.670> takes<00:01:05.060> a<00:01:05.180> lot<00:01:05.300> of<00:01:05.330> time<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.840> recharge

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
has it takes a lot of time to recharge

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.230 
has it takes a lot of time to recharge
to<00:01:07.250> recharge<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.270> goes<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.960> know<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.410> goes

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
to recharge and it goes you know it goes

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.790 
to recharge and it goes you know it goes
how<00:01:11.240> do<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.480> say<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.720> go<00:01:12.110> let's<00:01:12.380> say<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.620> goes

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
how do you say it go let's say it goes

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.400 
how do you say it go let's say it goes
out<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.190> ammo<00:01:13.370> very<00:01:14.120> fast<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.810> then<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> takes

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
out of ammo very fast and then it takes

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.290 
out of ammo very fast and then it takes
a<00:01:15.560> lot<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.800> time<00:01:15.980> to<00:01:16.100> recharge<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:16.850> that's<00:01:17.030> why

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
a lot of time to recharge so that's why

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.580 
a lot of time to recharge so that's why
I<00:01:17.330> think<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.140> bad<00:01:18.350> weapon

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
I think that it's a bad weapon

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
I think that it's a bad weapon
especially<00:01:19.490> because<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.850> kills<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.510> slowly

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
especially because it kills very slowly

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.110 
especially because it kills very slowly
but<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.980> good<00:01:22.160> weapon<00:01:22.310> because<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.850> has

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
but it's a good weapon because it has

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.630 
but it's a good weapon because it has
infinite<00:01:23.570> ammo<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:25.010> patience

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
infinite ammo and if you have patience

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.330 
infinite ammo and if you have patience
you<00:01:25.820> can<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.840> know<00:01:26.960> kill<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.590> can<00:01:27.800> like<00:01:27.980> red

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you can you know kill you can like red

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.030 
you can you know kill you can like red
try<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.790> kill<00:01:29.000> those<00:01:29.120> off<00:01:29.300> so<00:01:29.540> that's<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.920> the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
try and kill those off so that's so the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.950 
try and kill those off so that's so the
flamethrower<00:01:31.520> gets<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.030> horrible<00:01:32.540> mention

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
flamethrower gets the horrible mention

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.870 
flamethrower gets the horrible mention
because<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:33.380> bad<00:01:33.710> at<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.250> at<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.490> same<00:01:34.670> time

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
because it's bad at and at the same time

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.420 
because it's bad at and at the same time
it's<00:01:35.090> good<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.900> 10<00:01:36.140> place<00:01:36.440> I<00:01:36.710> decided<00:01:37.280> to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
it's good so in 10 place I decided to

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.630 
it's good so in 10 place I decided to
put<00:01:37.640> 3<00:01:37.970> SMGs<00:01:38.720> from<00:01:39.380> black<00:01:39.590> ops<00:01:39.860> 1<00:01:40.160> I<00:01:40.190> think<00:01:40.340> that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
put 3 SMGs from black ops 1 I think that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.420 
put 3 SMGs from black ops 1 I think that
these<00:01:40.790> three<00:01:41.030> SMGs<00:01:41.780> are<00:01:41.990> terrible<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:43.160> first

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
these three SMGs are terrible the first

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.140 
these three SMGs are terrible the first
one<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.840> worst<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.470> these<00:01:45.680> three<00:01:46.010> SMG<00:01:46.940> is

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
one and the worst of these three SMG is

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.380 
one and the worst of these three SMG is
the<00:01:47.480> pm-63<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.530> my<00:01:48.650> opinion<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.580> shoots<00:01:50.060> too

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
the pm-63 in my opinion it shoots too

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.620 
the pm-63 in my opinion it shoots too
fast<00:01:50.750> until<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:51.410> round<00:01:51.710> 10<00:01:52.100> 15<00:01:53.120> you<00:01:53.510> know

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
fast until like round 10 15 you know

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.650 
fast until like round 10 15 you know
it's<00:01:53.840> usable<00:01:54.620> but<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.370> shoots<00:01:55.670> too<00:01:55.970> fast<00:01:56.330> and

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's usable but it shoots too fast and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.950 
it's usable but it shoots too fast and
it<00:01:57.380> goes<00:01:57.740> out<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.040> ammo<00:01:58.340> too<00:01:58.640> fast<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.390> mean

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
it goes out of ammo too fast so I mean

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480 
it goes out of ammo too fast so I mean
you<00:02:00.050> kill<00:02:00.260> 5<00:02:00.500> zombies<00:02:00.920> you're<00:02:01.010> out<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.190> ammo

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
you kill 5 zombies you're out of ammo

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.890 
you kill 5 zombies you're out of ammo
the<00:02:02.000> next<00:02:02.300> one<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.350> mp5<00:02:03.980> this<00:02:04.790> one<00:02:05.090> shoots

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
the next one is the mp5 this one shoots

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.430 
the next one is the mp5 this one shoots
a<00:02:06.080> little<00:02:06.380> bit<00:02:06.500> slower<00:02:06.830> but<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:08.630> still<00:02:09.110> goes

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
a little bit slower but it still goes

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.190 
a little bit slower but it still goes
out<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.860> ammo<00:02:10.039> super<00:02:10.610> fast<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
out of ammo super fast and just like the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.809 
out of ammo super fast and just like the
just

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
just

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.500 
just
the<00:02:12.939> pm-63<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:14.260> has<00:02:14.500> no<00:02:14.739> stopping<00:02:15.219> power<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.819> it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the pm-63 it has no stopping power so it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.979 
the pm-63 it has no stopping power so it
stops<00:02:16.870> doing<00:02:17.260> damage<00:02:17.709> very<00:02:18.250> very<00:02:18.810> early<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
stops doing damage very very early and

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.349 
stops doing damage very very early and
finally<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.950> worst<00:02:21.310> out<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.700> these<00:02:22.090> three

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
finally the worst out of these three

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.530 
finally the worst out of these three
SMGs<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.560> specter<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:24.579> unlike<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
SMGs is the specter because unlike the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.229 
SMGs is the specter because unlike the
other<00:02:25.750> two<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.769> one<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.609> other<00:02:27.640> two<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.090> get

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
other two this one the other two you get

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.849 
other two this one the other two you get
them<00:02:28.450> from<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.780> wall<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.290> when<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.620> run<00:02:29.799> out

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
them from the wall so when you run out

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.039 
them from the wall so when you run out
of<00:02:29.980> ammo<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.519> always<00:02:30.790> give<00:02:31.060> ammo<00:02:31.359> but

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
of ammo you can always give ammo but

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.319 
of ammo you can always give ammo but
this<00:02:32.140> one<00:02:32.379> you<00:02:32.500> get<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.799> from<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.040> box<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.180> get

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
this one you get it from the box you get

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.479 
this one you get it from the box you get
it<00:02:34.450> from<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.750> mystery<00:02:35.200> box<00:02:35.409> so<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.159> cannot

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
it from the mystery box so you cannot

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.539 
it from the mystery box so you cannot
get<00:02:36.730> ammo<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> shoots<00:02:38.560> too<00:02:38.859> fast<00:02:39.220> it

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
get ammo for it so it shoots too fast it

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.089 
get ammo for it so it shoots too fast it
goes<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.359> them<00:02:40.480> or<00:02:40.629> too<00:02:40.810> fast<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.409> you

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
goes out of them or too fast and you

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.309 
goes out of them or too fast and you
can't<00:02:42.400> buy<00:02:42.579> ammo<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.299> pretty<00:02:43.629> much<00:02:43.780> will<00:02:44.079> kill

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
can't buy ammo so pretty much will kill

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.440 
can't buy ammo so pretty much will kill
you<00:02:44.500> will<00:02:44.650> waste<00:02:44.829> nine<00:02:45.159> nine<00:02:46.000> hundred<00:02:46.329> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
you will waste nine nine hundred and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
you will waste nine nine hundred and
fifty<00:02:46.750> points<00:02:47.139> and<00:02:47.349> you<00:02:47.769> won't<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.099> able<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
fifty points and you won't be able to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.399 
fifty points and you won't be able to
get<00:02:48.670> more<00:02:48.849> ammo<00:02:49.090> for<00:02:49.389> this<00:02:49.510> piece<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.750> crap<00:02:50.079> in

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
get more ammo for this piece of crap in

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.159 
get more ammo for this piece of crap in

it's worthless we have the thumper and
the<00:02:56.590> thumper<00:02:57.129> is<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.669> worst<00:02:58.680> launcher<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the thumper is the worst launcher a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.129 
the thumper is the worst launcher a

zombies<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:04.959> absolutely<00:03:05.680> worthless<00:03:06.010> it

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
zombies it's absolutely worthless it

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.170 
zombies it's absolutely worthless it
stops<00:03:07.329> doing<00:03:07.659> damage<00:03:08.099> very<00:03:09.099> very<00:03:09.430> early<00:03:09.939> and

stops doing damage very very early and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.229 
stops doing damage very very early and
it<00:03:10.930> has<00:03:11.169> D<00:03:11.409> when<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.829> fires<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:12.489> has<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.849> weird

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
it has D when it fires it has this weird

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.599 
it has D when it fires it has this weird
animation<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.200> goes<00:03:14.409> like<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:14.889> it's<00:03:15.549> very

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
animation it goes like up it's very

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.319 
animation it goes like up it's very
weird<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:18.190> takes<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.669> lot<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:18.879> time<00:03:19.180> to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
weird and it takes a lot of time to

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.490 
weird and it takes a lot of time to
write<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.859> recharge<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.549> reload<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.500> that's

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
write to to recharge to reload so that's

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.699 
write to to recharge to reload so that's
why<00:03:23.889> I<00:03:23.919> do<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.519> like<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.449> launcher<00:03:26.319> usually

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
why I do not like this launcher usually

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.649 
why I do not like this launcher usually
usually<00:03:27.099> launchers<00:03:27.790> are<00:03:27.909> good<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:28.479> one

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
usually launchers are good but this one

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.439 
usually launchers are good but this one
is<00:03:28.810> bad<00:03:29.049> in<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.340> 8th<00:03:30.639> place<00:03:30.879> we<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.299> the
