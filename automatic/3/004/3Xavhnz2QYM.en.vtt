it's<00:04:30.520> easy<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.300> mean<00:04:31.570> no<00:04:31.720> it's<00:04:31.870> not<00:04:32.020> necessarily

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
it's easy I mean no it's not necessarily

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.500 
it's easy I mean no it's not necessarily
easier<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.490> guess<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:34.000> guess<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.389> little

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
easier I guess I guess a little

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.830 
easier I guess I guess a little
detangling<00:04:35.139> process<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.770> lot<00:04:35.950> easier<00:04:36.190> but<00:04:37.000> just

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
detangling process a lot easier but just

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.629 
detangling process a lot easier but just
think<00:04:38.110> about<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.410> just<00:04:38.530> know<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:39.250> it's<00:04:39.460> not

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
think about it just know that it's not

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.969 
think about it just know that it's not
it's<00:04:40.090> not<00:04:40.360> always<00:04:40.960> greener<00:04:41.590> on<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.889> other

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
it's not always greener on the other

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.240 
it's not always greener on the other
side<00:04:42.160> you<00:04:42.970> know<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.650> some<00:04:44.860> point<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.130> this

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250
