00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.450
 hello guys today we are going to 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.940
 prepare delicious shrimp with 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.959
 broccoli and for this here we have the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.450
 ingredients that are fish sauce 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.780
 half a cup of water one pound 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.990
 broccoli shrimp 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.950
 butter tacit media 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.770
 teaspoon cornstarch 3 garlic a 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.770
 teaspoon of garlic and chili salt 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.770
 applied 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.350
 first let's start by heating 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.449
 the butter 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.430
 when the butter is already hot 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.000
 add the garlic so that they are fried 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.150
 little bit in the butter 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.110
 we can see how the garlics are already 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.050
 taking a nice golden color 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.790
 time to add the garlic salt the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 we let it warm up a little bit to 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.140
 that we can add the shrimp 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.229
 we cook taking great care that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 Cosan our shrimp not more 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.520
 we only leave about 2 minutes on one side 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 and we flipped 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.510
 they are already cooked on both sides 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.090
 while dating but you're not over 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.090
 cooked the time to add the broccoli 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.400
 because we already added broccoli now 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.560
 let's let it cook a little 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.810
 with steam and when we have it 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.320
 ready then it's time to add 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.220
 the maizena that I gave we serve in the middle 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.220
 water cup 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.549
 this is ready then we are going to 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.549
 add cornstarch cups 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.460
 and we keep moving so that they do not get 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.460
 chromos 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.990
 It feels like they are too thick 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.910
 can add a little water up 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.569
 that acquires the consistency that you 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.330
 they want good as it is ready now not 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.290
 it is the time that we add 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.510
 half cup of fish sauce in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 shrimp sauce can also add 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.160
 your oyster sauce to your liking 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.840
 as a final touch we add the chile 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 broken but as I told you I repeat 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.520
 now and this is already optional and that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.520
 it depends on the taste it can be without chile 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 and good my loves this was the result 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.440
 final I hope you like many 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.570

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.570
