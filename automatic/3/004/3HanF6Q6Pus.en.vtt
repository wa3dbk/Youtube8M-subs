00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
don't know about you guys but when I saw
decent<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.770> Amazon<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> pictures<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
decent and like Amazon the pictures it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.380 
decent and like Amazon the pictures it
looks<00:02:03.869> pretty<00:02:04.229> ugly<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
looks pretty ugly but when I see it in

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.510 
looks pretty ugly but when I see it in
real<00:02:06.420> life<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.930> actually<00:02:07.110> looks<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:08.220> good

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
real life I actually looks pretty good

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.540 
real life I actually looks pretty good
pretty<00:02:08.970> decent

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
pretty decent

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.690 
pretty decent
this<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.760> my<00:02:10.790> opinion<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.990> yeah<00:02:12.230> there's<00:02:12.470> some

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
this in my opinion and yeah there's some

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.290 
this in my opinion and yeah there's some
scratches<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:13.940> just<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:15.110> from<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.300> sticker

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
scratches but just just from the sticker

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.290 
scratches but just just from the sticker
and<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.200> phone<00:02:18.350> doesn't<00:02:18.650> feel<00:02:18.890> bulky<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.880> it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and the phone doesn't feel bulky so it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.970 
and the phone doesn't feel bulky so it
fits<00:02:20.570> nicely<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.710> reasons

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
fits nicely that's one of the reasons

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.210 
fits nicely that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> got<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> first<00:02:23.270> place<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
why I got this in the first place and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.970 
why I got this in the first place and
the<00:02:25.220> budgets<00:02:25.550> work<00:02:25.790> extremely<00:02:26.510> well<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.230> it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
the budgets work extremely well so it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.640 
the budgets work extremely well so it
have<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.250> push<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:28.940> hard<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.540> those<00:02:29.720> rinky

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
have to push it hard like those rinky

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.170 
have to push it hard like those rinky
cases<00:02:31.160> i<00:02:31.340> don't<00:02:31.760> know<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:31.850> i'm<00:02:32.000> pronouncing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
cases i don't know if i'm pronouncing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.520 
cases i don't know if i'm pronouncing
them<00:02:32.600> right<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:34.370> very<00:02:34.520> easy<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.850> press<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
them right so it's very easy to press a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.930 
them right so it's very easy to press a
volume<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.680> well<00:02:36.730> i'll<00:02:37.730> show<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:39.940> they're

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
volume as well i'll show you they're

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.780 
volume as well i'll show you they're
pretty<00:02:41.090> easy<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.650> there's<00:02:42.650> some<00:02:42.860> bumpers<00:02:43.550> on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
pretty easy and there's some bumpers on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.730 
pretty easy and there's some bumpers on
the<00:02:43.910> front<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.270> well<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.680> to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
the front as well so it's going to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.490 
the front as well so it's going to
survive<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.430> drops<00:02:46.700> from<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> front<00:02:47.500> so

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
survive the drops from the front so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.340 
survive the drops from the front so
that's<00:02:49.010> why<00:02:49.160> i<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:49.970> case<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.900> i<00:02:51.200> forgot

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
that's why i like this case so i forgot

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.840 
that's why i like this case so i forgot
to<00:02:51.500> mention<00:02:51.590> one<00:02:51.980> more<00:02:52.010> thing<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.640> that's

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
to mention one more thing and that's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.660 
to mention one more thing and that's
this<00:02:53.540> camera<00:02:54.110> lens<00:02:54.320> here<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.800> without<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
this camera lens here and without the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.080 
this camera lens here and without the
case<00:02:55.970> since<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.080> camera<00:02:57.560> lens<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.610> pretty<00:02:58.850> big

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
case since the camera lens is pretty big

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.540 
case since the camera lens is pretty big
it<00:02:59.960> was<00:03:00.170> actually<00:03:00.440> rock<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.040> phone<00:03:01.250> because

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
it was actually rock the phone because

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.910 
it was actually rock the phone because
of<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.540> height<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.110> camera<00:03:03.410> lives<00:03:03.620> but

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
of the height of the camera lives but

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.170 
of the height of the camera lives but
with<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.670> case<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:06.020> that's<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.070> rock<00:03:07.280> so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
with the case it's it that's a rock so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.020 
with the case it's it that's a rock so
like<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.750> see<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.260> stay<00:03:09.710> still<00:03:10.030> so

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
like you can see it just stay still so

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.880 
like you can see it just stay still so
it's<00:03:11.240> perfectly<00:03:11.690> fine<00:03:11.930> because<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.500> lens<00:03:12.680> is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
it's perfectly fine because the lens is

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.520 
it's perfectly fine because the lens is
actually<00:03:13.370> below<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:15.010> load<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.190> case<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.910> i

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
actually below the load of the case so i

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.180 
actually below the load of the case so i
don't<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.709> can<00:03:18.830> see<00:03:18.980> from<00:03:19.070> the
