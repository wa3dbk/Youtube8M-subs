finder<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> 300<00:00:26.970> watts<00:00:27.240> so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
finder and I think this is 300 watts so

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.380 
finder and I think this is 300 watts so
you're<00:00:27.930> still<00:00:28.170> getting<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.529> penetration
