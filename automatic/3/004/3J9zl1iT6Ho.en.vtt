00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.450
 no more follows blind 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.270
 well let's start little mermaids first 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.069
 I'm going to show you how I had my 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.350
 extensions and here I will be 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:25.280
 using these from the brand of lahm and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.130
 these are 220 grams 22 inches in 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.630
 the ace ace plan number 60 for the dye 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.899
 I'm going to do mixing this one of the brand 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.420
 splash in the color blue in my daughter john 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.420
 wright in the color and mix very well 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.140
 Now I'm going to apply a little bit of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.680
 conditioner and here I am using 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.320
 this one of soaps in 6 and it's called margin 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.030
 shine and mix it very well brush 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.460
 the extensions very carefully and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.950
 let's start painting those extensions of 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
 hair are 100% human hair the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.660
 you can follow you can wave them 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.180
 You can salazar and distill as if it were 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.250
 your own hair I will let you process 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.380
 the dye for an hour and then I'll 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.880
 wash the extensions with a shampoo and a 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 regular conditioner 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.459
 to save a little bit of time and I 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.500
 I put the extensions but if you want to see 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.299
 a video on how to apply them here I'm going 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 to be leaving the link in the box 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.920
 of description to give a bit of 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 volume I'm going to apply this product and what 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.269
 let's apply at the root and that too 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.269
 will help absorb any excess 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 of fat to give it a texture 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 snapshot 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.090
 to protect my hair from the heat I'm going to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.890
 Apply a protector on all the hair 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.890
 and we are going to gently brush it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.230
 since the ends of my hair tend 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.600
 to make it a little drier I'm going to apply 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.100
 this oil is called instead of honey 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.650
 I love this product because 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.480
 literally it is invisible as the name 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.400
 He says it because he does not leave his hair 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
 fatty 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.349
 we're not going to start by dividing the hair 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.269
 in half holding small 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.239
 sections of the back as of 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.610
 an inch I'm developing my hair 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.459
 with these 32 brads 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.500
 millimeters let's curl the hair to 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.049
 that the curls go in the direction 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.269
 opposite of the face we left it for about 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.939
 10 seconds and then I'm going to release the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.739
 I curl in my hand until it cools 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.739
 will help the curls last much longer 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.420
 the section in front I'll be 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.110
 praying inward to shape 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.110
 to the face 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.970
 this clip create a very very beautiful light 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.490
 and well now let's move on to the other side 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.100
 of the hair in curling the back 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.800
 with curlers in the opposite direction of 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.020
 face and the section in front we're going 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.000
 to roll in 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 if gathered here in the comments 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.230
 tell me if you liked this color of 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.660
 hair because a lot of you have 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.370
 been asking what color do I have like this 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.740
 that's why I decided to teach them the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.740
 dye that I am currently using 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.000
 you can separate the curls with my fingers 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.800
 and then I'm going to fix them with a spray of 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.800
 light finish 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.310
 now let's go with the crest or the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.530
 fringe I will apply hair spray on the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.099
 root and I'll be using a comb 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.539
 with small teeth to give volume 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.509
 brush the top layer gently 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.280
 paralyze it a bit and finally with the 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.919
 tips I will give it shape as a 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.580
 circle as such and we will ensure it 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.590
 with a pin and ready if you want them 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.669
