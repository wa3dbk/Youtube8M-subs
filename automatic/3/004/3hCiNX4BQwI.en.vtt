go<00:01:50.460> ahead<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.210> we've<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
go ahead and look at here we've got the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
go ahead and look at here we've got the
commando<00:01:52.409> let's<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.369> test<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> heat<00:01:54.180> here

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
commando let's go test out the heat here

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
commando let's go test out the heat here
with<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> large<00:01:54.869> pulse<00:01:55.140> blast<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.490> I'm

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
with a large pulse blast you can see I'm

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
with a large pulse blast you can see I'm
just<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> hold<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.210> down<00:01:58.490> alright

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
just going to hold this down alright

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
just going to hold this down alright
let's<00:02:00.090> target<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.960> left<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.560> let's<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
let's target this left or so let's go to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
let's target this left or so let's go to
pull<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.220> trigger<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.880> three<00:02:03.180> medium

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
pull the trigger on all three medium

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.580 
pull the trigger on all three medium
lasers<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.490> duration<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:07.140> cut<00:02:07.560> down

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
lasers and see the duration is cut down

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.669 
lasers and see the duration is cut down
just<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.250> little<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.720> all<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:09.899> let's<00:02:10.530> go

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
just a little bit all right let's go

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
just a little bit all right let's go
ahead<00:02:10.799> give<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.340> full<00:02:11.700> he<00:02:12.150> doesn't<00:02:12.420> he

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
ahead give this now full he doesn't he

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.720 
ahead give this now full he doesn't he
doesn't<00:02:12.540> need<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.930> leg<00:02:13.170> let's<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.490 

alright<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.970> let's<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> move<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> shoot<00:02:19.319> on

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
alright so let's go to move and shoot on

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.899 
alright so let's go to move and shoot on
the<00:02:19.709> move<00:02:19.920> sort<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> give<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.519> an<00:02:20.610> idea<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
the move sort of give you an idea of

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.509 
the move sort of give you an idea of
what<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.329> is<00:02:21.390> under<00:02:21.959> pressure<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.890> again

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
what this is under pressure here again

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.970 
what this is under pressure here again
utilizing<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.599> range<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.230> these<00:02:25.439> weapons

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
utilizing the range of these weapons

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.130 
utilizing the range of these weapons
systems<00:02:26.489> now<00:02:26.700> you're<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.810> able<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
systems now you're going to be able to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.009 
systems now you're going to be able to
hit<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:28.890> bit<00:02:29.040> further<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
hit a little bit further out and do it

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.020 
hit a little bit further out and do it
more<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.680> your<00:02:31.769> effective<00:02:32.280> damage<00:02:32.670> at<00:02:32.849> those

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
more of your effective damage at those

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.869 
more of your effective damage at those
ranges<00:02:33.560> again<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:34.739> stick<00:02:35.250> different

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
ranges again you can stick different

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.789 
ranges again you can stick different
models<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.390> depending<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.109> what<00:02:37.319> setups<00:02:37.680> you

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
models on depending on what setups you

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.800 
models on depending on what setups you
go<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.370> could<00:02:38.549> go<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.060> four

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
go with you could go with the four

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
six with Artemis something to that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.629 
six with Artemis something to that
effect<00:02:45.810> maybe<00:02:46.709> if<00:02:46.859> you<00:02:47.159> wanted<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.519> do<00:02:47.609> a

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
effect maybe if you wanted to do a

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.520 
effect maybe if you wanted to do a
standard<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.629> want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> recommend<00:02:49.109> but

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
standard which I want to recommend but

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.670 
standard which I want to recommend but
you<00:02:49.650> can't<00:02:50.569> or<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.629> can<00:02:51.810> see<00:02:52.049> here<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.650> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you can't or you can see here you can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
you can't or you can see here you can
definitely<00:02:52.980> chain<00:02:53.519> fire<00:02:53.790> your<00:02:54.090> mediums<00:02:54.540> as

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
definitely chain fire your mediums as

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.050 
definitely chain fire your mediums as
well<00:02:55.049> ride<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.799> heat<00:02:56.040> line<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.879> course

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
well ride that heat line and of course

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
well ride that heat line and of course
this<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.420> without<00:03:00.599> any<00:03:00.780> additional<00:03:01.170> double

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this is without any additional double

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.360 
this is without any additional double
heat<00:03:02.159> sinks<00:03:02.579> which<00:03:02.879> on<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.989> wrong<00:03:04.620> map<00:03:05.069> might

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
heat sinks which on the wrong map might

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.099 
heat sinks which on the wrong map might
run<00:03:05.639> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:05.730> bit<00:03:06.030> hot<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.480> again<00:03:06.689> that's

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
run a little bit hot so again that's

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.140 
run a little bit hot so again that's
something<00:03:07.319> where<00:03:07.650> maybe<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.920> drop<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.430> SRM

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
something where maybe you drop the SRM

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.119 
something where maybe you drop the SRM
or<00:03:09.680> switch<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.859> up<00:03:11.069> maybe<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.579> smaller<00:03:11.879> engine

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
or switch this up maybe a smaller engine

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.780 
or switch this up maybe a smaller engine
something<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.489> effect<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.459> definitely

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
something to that effect but definitely

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.610 
something to that effect but definitely
in<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.909> range<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.450> noticeable<00:03:19.139> right<00:03:19.379> off<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
in the range is noticeable right off the
