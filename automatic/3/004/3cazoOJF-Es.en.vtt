value chart and most of you abuse use

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.540 
value chart and most of you abuse use
the<00:00:07.350> value<00:00:07.649> chart<00:00:07.859> I've<00:00:08.040> seen<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.280> value

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the value chart I've seen the value

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.759 
the value chart I've seen the value
chart<00:00:08.700> most<00:00:08.940> books<00:00:09.179> show<00:00:09.360> those<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.840> was

chart most books show those I was
telling<00:00:11.010> audience<00:00:11.340> that's<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:11.759> you've

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
telling audience that's because you've

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.370

mean<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.710> understand<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.639> all

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
mean that we understand because we all

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.490 
mean that we understand because we all
struggle<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.269> values<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> our

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
struggle in values as we do in our

struggle in values as we do in our
personal<00:00:16.859> life<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.760> many<00:00:17.970> times<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.359> our

personal life so many times in our
values<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.380> makes<00:00:19.560> sense<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.920> struggling

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
values it makes sense that we struggling

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.980 
values it makes sense that we struggling

the<00:00:34.320> number<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.770> looks<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.670> white<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.050> black

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the number one looks from white to black

the number one looks from white to black
with<00:00:37.739> eight<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> between<00:00:38.570> now<00:00:39.570> once<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.899> get

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
with eight in between now once we get

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.270 
with eight in between now once we get
into<00:00:40.200> colors<00:00:40.530> you're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:40.950> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
into colors you're going to see it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.130 
into colors you're going to see it's
blue<00:00:41.730> paint<00:00:41.969> how<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.270> harder<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> see

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
blue paint how much harder it is to see

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
blue paint how much harder it is to see
values<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> color<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
values because of the color and the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
values because of the color and the
temperature<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.230> intensity

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
temperature of color and the intensity

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
temperature of color and the intensity
of<00:00:47.039> color<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> every<00:00:48.780> good<00:00:48.930> painting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
of color and every good painting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
of color and every good painting
whatever<00:00:50.129> ones<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.520> study<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> one

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
whatever ones that we study are the one

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
whatever ones that we study are the one
that<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> give<00:00:52.980> three

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that we do basically need to give three

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
that we do basically need to give three
qualities<00:00:53.640> dark<00:00:53.940> sliced<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> intermediate

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
qualities dark sliced and intermediate

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
qualities dark sliced and intermediate
grades<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:55.649> those<00:00:55.860> grades<00:00:56.129> again<00:00:56.520> could<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
grades now those grades again could be

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760 
grades now those grades again could be
greens<00:00:57.090> round<00:00:57.539> purple<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.410> doesn't<00:00:58.680> really

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
greens round purple it doesn't really

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
greens round purple it doesn't really
matter<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> everyone<00:01:01.140> struggled<00:01:01.530> with

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
matter and I see everyone struggled with

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
matter and I see everyone struggled with
those<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.280> did<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.879> still<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
those because I did I still do and the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
those because I did I still do and the
Masters<00:01:04.080> did<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> when<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> break<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> down

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Masters did and when you break it down

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
Masters did and when you break it down
to<00:01:06.030> black<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> white<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.260> drawing<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to black and white not just drawing the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
to black and white not just drawing the
black<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> white<00:01:08.130> value<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> portrait

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
black and white value be it a portrait

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
black and white value be it a portrait
or<00:01:10.170> anything<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> whole<00:01:10.979> lot<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.460> seemed<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
or anything as a whole lot it seemed to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
or anything as a whole lot it seemed to
be<00:01:11.880> simpler<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.330> sometimes<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> little

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
be simpler but sometimes it's a little

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
be simpler but sometimes it's a little
harder<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.280> color<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> if

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
harder because we don't have color so if

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
harder because we don't have color so if
you<00:01:16.890> look<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.369> basically<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.970> number

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you look on here basically my number

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
you look on here basically my number
five<00:01:18.600> squared<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.470> did<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> class

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
five squared we did this in class

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
five squared we did this in class
actually<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> sharp<00:01:21.299> edge<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
actually have kind of a sharp edge and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.850 
actually have kind of a sharp edge and
here<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.080> actually<00:01:22.350> made<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.710> bit

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
here and actually made that little bit

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
here and actually made that little bit
too<00:01:23.009> dark<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.430> side<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.360> little

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
too dark on one side of this one little

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
too dark on one side of this one little
bit<00:01:24.930> darker<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.820> studying<00:01:26.820> inside<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
bit darker so studying inside of the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
bit darker so studying inside of the
value<00:01:27.869> chart<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> overall<00:01:29.729> twin

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
value chart not just the overall twin

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
value chart not just the overall twin
ten<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.170> each<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.590> pertains<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
ten but how each one pertains to the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069

we<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:39.260> very<00:01:39.740> simple<00:01:40.010> painting<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.400> did<00:01:40.550> in

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
we have very simple painting we did in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.880 
we have very simple painting we did in
class<00:01:40.790> two<00:01:41.660> colors<00:01:41.990> black<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.410> white<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.740> use

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
class two colors black and white we use

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.410 
class two colors black and white we use
an<00:01:43.040> ivory<00:01:43.340> black<00:01:43.520> which<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.000> warm<00:01:44.180> black

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
an ivory black which is the warm black

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.870 
an ivory black which is the warm black
and<00:01:44.890> -<00:01:45.890> tanning<00:01:46.220> white<00:01:46.370> which<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.670> fairly

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
and - tanning white which is fairly

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.050 
and - tanning white which is fairly
neutral<00:01:47.660> white<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:49.520> see<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.850> here

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
neutral white so you can see in here

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.450 
neutral white so you can see in here
which<00:01:50.390> may<00:01:50.660> look<00:01:50.870> like<00:01:51.050> 10<00:01:51.410> really<00:01:51.979> dark<00:01:52.250> but

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
which may look like 10 really dark but

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.980 
which may look like 10 really dark but
there's<00:01:52.640> none<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.910> those<00:01:53.060> actually<00:01:53.540> 10<00:01:53.780> which

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
there's none of those actually 10 which

there's none of those actually 10 which
is<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> black<00:01:54.410> as<00:01:54.590> we<00:01:54.740> get<00:01:55.010> these<00:01:55.700> are<00:01:55.880> some

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
is a black as we get these are some

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.150 
is a black as we get these are some
nines<00:01:56.450> or<00:01:56.630> even<00:01:56.869> maybe<00:01:57.020> nines<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.619> sand<00:01:58.040> yes

nines or even maybe nines and a sand yes

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.250 
nines or even maybe nines and a sand yes
we<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.520> talk<00:01:58.760> about<00:01:58.910> half<00:01:59.210> tones<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.810> the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
we will talk about half tones and the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.080 
we will talk about half tones and the
side<00:02:00.500> there<00:02:00.650> each<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.950> their<00:02:01.100> tones<00:02:01.369> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
side there each of their tones the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.060 
side there each of their tones the
whitest<00:02:02.510> white<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.619> little<00:02:03.860> bit<00:02:03.979> on

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
whitest white is here a little bit on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.450 
whitest white is here a little bit on
the<00:02:04.190> water<00:02:04.400> which<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.950> tenth<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.190> white

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the water which is a tenth of white

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.160 
the water which is a tenth of white
because<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.270> cross<00:02:08.509> between<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:09.140> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
because of that cross between one and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.410 
because of that cross between one and
two<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.310> hopefully<00:02:10.729> again<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.060> picks<00:02:11.300> up

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
two but hopefully again this picks up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.930 
two but hopefully again this picks up
you<00:02:11.570> can<00:02:11.720> see<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> lot<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.260> half<00:02:12.650> tones<00:02:12.980> threes

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
you can see a lot of half tones threes

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.050 
you can see a lot of half tones threes
to<00:02:14.360> threes<00:02:14.630> fours<00:02:15.020> into<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.830> gray<00:02:16.040> which<00:02:16.820> is<00:02:16.850> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
to threes fours into the gray which is a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.490 
to threes fours into the gray which is a
great<00:02:17.360> thing<00:02:17.510> about<00:02:17.600> landscape<00:02:18.260> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
great thing about landscape and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.560 
great thing about landscape and
seascapes<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> lot<00:02:19.730> more<00:02:19.880> depth<00:02:20.120> than

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
seascapes we have a lot more depth than

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.620 
seascapes we have a lot more depth than
we<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.810> maybe<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.140> floral<00:02:21.470> -<00:02:21.590> portraiture<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
we do maybe in floral - portraiture and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.449 
we do maybe in floral - portraiture and
so<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.780> again<00:02:24.020> if<00:02:24.140> these<00:02:24.290> are<00:02:24.440> purple<00:02:24.620> green<00:02:25.100> or

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
so if again if these are purple green or

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.160 
so if again if these are purple green or
reds<00:02:25.790> how<00:02:26.060> much<00:02:26.180> more<00:02:26.360> problematic<00:02:26.600> these

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
reds how much more problematic these

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.620 
reds how much more problematic these
these<00:02:27.590> may<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.640> even<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> sky's<00:02:29.239> about<00:02:29.600> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
these may be but even the sky's about a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.010 
these may be but even the sky's about a
number<00:02:29.959> two<00:02:30.140> value<00:02:30.650> 10<00:02:30.860> 10<00:02:31.489> 10<00:02:31.640> -<00:02:31.760> they're<00:02:32.020> very

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
number two value 10 10 10 - they're very

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.380 
number two value 10 10 10 - they're very
simple<00:02:33.440> painting<00:02:33.709> very<00:02:33.890> effective

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
simple painting very effective

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.660 
simple painting very effective
we<00:02:35.720> had<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.170> behind<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.620> which<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.980> now<00:02:37.160> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
we had one behind it which is now the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.740 
we had one behind it which is now the
business<00:02:37.850> selling<00:02:38.209> plant

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
business selling plant

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.600 
business selling plant
obviously<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> lot<00:02:39.739> different<00:02:40.160> because<00:02:40.280> we

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
obviously a lot different because we

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.250 
obviously a lot different because we
pushed<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.060> darks<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.510> lot<00:02:41.660> more<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.080> there

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
pushed the darks a lot more over there

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.160 
pushed the darks a lot more over there
and<00:02:42.530> because<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.400> pushed<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.120> 8<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.570> 9s<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
and because we pushed the 8 to 9s and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.890 
and because we pushed the 8 to 9s and
actually<00:02:46.040> maybe<00:02:46.190> some<00:02:46.459> tins<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.970> there<00:02:47.209> we

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
actually maybe some tins in there we

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.320 
actually maybe some tins in there we
have<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> few<00:02:48.560> white<00:02:49.190> whites<00:02:49.489> which<00:02:50.030> would<00:02:50.180> some

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
have a few white whites which would some

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.660 
have a few white whites which would some
of<00:02:50.360> your<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:51.350> made<00:02:51.650> us<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.310> main<00:02:52.430> white

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
of your one that made us the main white

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.670 
of your one that made us the main white
maybe<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> pot<00:02:53.450> maybe<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.380> one<00:02:54.530> on

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
maybe on the pot maybe a little one on

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.490 
maybe on the pot maybe a little one on
some<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.040> great<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.030> some<00:02:56.989> twos<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
some of the great and some twos and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.330 
some of the great and some twos and
three<00:02:57.709> down<00:02:57.980> here<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.970> drapes<00:02:59.239> on<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
three down here on the drapes on the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.300 
three down here on the drapes on the
doily<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.110> some<00:03:03.110> intermediates<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> lot

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
doily and some intermediates but a lot

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.880 
doily and some intermediates but a lot
of<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.410> lower<00:03:06.680> end

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
of that is really on the lower end

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.430 
of that is really on the lower end
probably<00:03:07.519> 70%<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.810> painting<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
probably 70% of this painting is the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.670 
probably 70% of this painting is the
higher<00:03:09.739> higher<00:03:10.670> end<00:03:10.880> on<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> dart<00:03:11.410> over<00:03:12.410> over

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
higher higher end on the dart over over

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.770 
higher higher end on the dart over over
and<00:03:12.799> have<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.040> want<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.280> look<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.549> those<00:03:13.780> so

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
and have you want to look on those so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.479 
and have you want to look on those so
the<00:03:14.959> difference<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> two<00:03:15.739> from<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.280> very

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the difference of the two from the very

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.730 
the difference of the two from the very
high<00:03:16.760> key<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.420> we

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
high key and that we

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.400 
high key and that we
looked<00:03:18.040> at<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:19.480> some<00:03:19.660> darts<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.140> lot<00:03:20.380> of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
looked at with some darts but a lot of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900 
looked at with some darts but a lot of
probably<00:03:20.830> 80%<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.400> painting<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.880> very

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
probably 80% of the painting is very

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.650 
probably 80% of the painting is very
light<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.420> value<00:03:23.020> -<00:03:23.740> this<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.310> 90%<00:03:25.270> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
light and value - this one is 90% the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.120 
light and value - this one is 90% the
painting<00:03:26.020> is<00:03:26.140> dark<00:03:26.410> with<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> few<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
painting is dark with a few of the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.370 
painting is dark with a few of the
lights<00:03:27.340> through<00:03:27.640> there<00:03:28.110> you're<00:03:29.110> gonna<00:03:29.260> see

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.420 
lights through there you're gonna see
some<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> other<00:03:29.800> episodes<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.310> we're

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
some of the other episodes that we're

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.680 
some of the other episodes that we're
gonna<00:03:30.520> start<00:03:30.820> showing<00:03:31.030> some<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> color

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
gonna start showing some of the color

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.970 
gonna start showing some of the color
with<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.990> value<00:03:32.260> chart<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.650> again<00:03:32.680> how

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
with the value chart and again how

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.350 
with the value chart and again how
differently<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.550> may<00:03:33.700> look<00:03:33.880> under<00:03:34.210> those

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
differently that may look under those

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.420 
differently that may look under those
