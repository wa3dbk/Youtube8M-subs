has<00:00:17.860> been<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.400> gradual<00:00:18.910> process<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.630> I<00:00:19.690> don't

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
has been a gradual process and I don't

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.410 
has been a gradual process and I don't

was<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.570> declaration<00:00:22.810> made<00:00:23.260> that<00:00:23.770> it<00:00:24.040> was<00:00:24.220> fine

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430
