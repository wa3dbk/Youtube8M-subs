when<00:00:02.340> people<00:00:02.550> talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:02.940> ignition<00:00:03.719> systems

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
when people talk about ignition systems

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990 
when people talk about ignition systems
what<00:00:04.529> they're<00:00:04.710> referring<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.700> means

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
what they're referring to is the means

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.810 
what they're referring to is the means
by<00:00:06.149> which<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.690> propellant<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.440> ignited<00:00:08.189> now

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
by which the propellant is ignited now

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.370 
by which the propellant is ignited now

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.590

remember<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.670> were<00:00:47.790> talking<00:00:48.060> about<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
remember when we were talking about the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200 
remember when we were talking about the
different<00:00:48.930> types<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.440> muzzle<00:00:49.890> loaders<00:00:50.210> well

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
different types of muzzle loaders well

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.930 
different types of muzzle loaders well
as<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.720> recall<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.530> flintlock<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> only

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
as you recall the flintlock was the only

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
as you recall the flintlock was the only
game<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.510> town<00:00:54.720> back<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.710> old<00:00:55.860> days

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
game in town back in the good old days

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150 
game in town back in the good old days
and<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.880> course<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.570> ignition<00:00:58.050> pipe<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.010> was

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
and of course the ignition pipe that was

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
and of course the ignition pipe that was
used<00:00:59.610> was<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> Flint<00:01:00.329> meaning<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
used was the Flint meaning that the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
used was the Flint meaning that the
spark<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> started<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> entire<00:01:03.450> process

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
spark that started the entire process

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.190 
spark that started the entire process
came<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.460> piece<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.909> Flint

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
came from a little piece of Flint

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.110 
came from a little piece of Flint
striking<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.560> steel<00:01:07.860> frizzen<00:01:08.550> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> lock

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
striking the steel frizzen of the lock

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.050

mechanism<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:10.620> of<00:01:10.860> course<00:01:11.190> that's<00:01:11.550> why<00:01:11.820> they

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mechanism and of course that's why they

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.560 
mechanism and of course that's why they
call<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.479> guns<00:01:13.070> flintlocks<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.420> the

call the guns flintlocks now this is the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.990 
call the guns flintlocks now this is the

about<00:01:21.170> 1850<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.409> new<00:01:22.740> type<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> muzzle<00:01:23.790> loader

ignition system came along that changed
everything<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.920> Chad's<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> tell<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
everything and Chad's going to tell you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
everything and Chad's going to tell you
about<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.690> now<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.200> he<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.530> remember

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
about that right now if he can remember

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130 
about that right now if he can remember
now<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.580> surprised<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.180> remembered<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
now I'm surprised you remembered back to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.890 
now I'm surprised you remembered back to
1850<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.190> probably<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> biggest

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
behind the inline was that it was easier

fact a standard 209 primer releases so
much<00:04:12.630> energy<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.859> expel<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.459> bullet

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
much energy that it can expel a bullet

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.719 
much energy that it can expel a bullet

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
at all unfortunately it can also

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.779 
at all unfortunately it can also
displace<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.479> entire<00:04:21.810> propellant<00:04:22.620> and

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
displace the entire propellant and

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.370 
displace the entire propellant and
projectile<00:04:23.789> charge<00:04:24.150> prior<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.930> complete

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
inline muzzleloaders they actually have

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.750 
inline muzzleloaders they actually have
less<00:04:36.600> explosive<00:04:37.170> material<00:04:38.010> than<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> standard

less explosive material than a standard
209<00:04:39.360> but<00:04:40.260> still<00:04:40.560> plenty<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.220> ignite<00:04:41.490> a

muzzleloader<00:04:42.120> now<00:04:42.720> these<00:04:42.930> primers<00:04:43.320> are<00:04:43.680> made

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
muzzleloader now these primers are made

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.880 
muzzleloader now these primers are made
by<00:04:44.160> Winchester<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.120> are<00:04:45.300> called<00:04:45.860> triple7

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
by Winchester and are called triple7

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.860 
by Winchester and are called triple7
this<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.760> because<00:04:48.120> they<00:04:48.420> were<00:04:48.480> first

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
this is because they were first

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.230 
this is because they were first
developed<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.470> use<00:04:49.860> with<00:04:50.240> triple7

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
developed for use with triple7

developed for use with triple7
propellant<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.350> we<00:04:52.500> have<00:04:52.680> found<00:04:52.950> that<00:04:53.160> they

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.120

of<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> propellant<00:04:56.850> used<00:04:57.240> now<00:04:57.990> these<00:04:58.680> are
