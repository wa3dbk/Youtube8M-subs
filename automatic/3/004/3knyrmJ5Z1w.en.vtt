don't<00:00:46.920> forget<00:00:47.960> some<00:00:48.960> other<00:00:49.110> pros<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
don't forget some other pros are that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
don't forget some other pros are that
they're<00:00:50.550> already<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> maybe<00:00:51.719> most<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
they're already back to maybe most of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
they're already back to maybe most of
the<00:00:52.230> time<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.640> end<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.879> being<00:00:54.090> cheaper

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the time and they end up being cheaper

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
the time and they end up being cheaper
overall<00:00:55.260> anyway<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:56.190> cheaper<00:00:56.550> than<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
overall anyway so they're cheaper than a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
overall anyway so they're cheaper than a
pet<00:00:56.910> store<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> they're<00:00:57.480> already<00:00:57.719> vaccine

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pet store and they're already vaccine

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
pet store and they're already vaccine
you<00:00:58.440> too<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.160> even<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you too which makes them even more of a

small color selection because they
usually<00:05:52.699> only<00:05:53.120> try<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.810> make<00:05:54.050> certain<00:05:54.830> colors

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.370 

sometimes<00:05:58.430> parent<00:05:59.330> breeders<00:05:59.660> are<00:05:59.810> far<00:06:00.199> away

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
sometimes parent breeders are far away

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.420 
sometimes parent breeders are far away
the<00:06:00.680> closest<00:06:01.099> ferret<00:06:01.789> readers<00:06:02.539> to<00:06:02.750> me<00:06:02.900> are<00:06:03.430> 14

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
the closest ferret readers to me are 14

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.390 
the closest ferret readers to me are 14
hours<00:06:04.940> away<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:06.699> the<00:06:07.699> last<00:06:07.910> con<00:06:08.270> is<00:06:08.599> that

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
hours away and the last con is that

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.870 
hours away and the last con is that
sometimes<00:06:10.400> they<00:06:10.880> don't<00:06:11.330> come<00:06:11.630> neutered<00:06:12.080> so

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
sometimes they don't come neutered so

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.700 
sometimes they don't come neutered so
they<00:06:13.880> tend<00:06:14.150> to<00:06:14.180> be<00:06:14.300> sort<00:06:14.660> of<00:06:14.750> expensive<00:06:15.229> and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
they tend to be sort of expensive and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.710 
they tend to be sort of expensive and
then<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.070> top<00:06:16.310> off<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.820> price<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.060> neutering

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
then you top off the price and neutering

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.710 
then you top off the price and neutering
them<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:19.400> can<00:06:19.610> make<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:20.479> even<00:06:20.599> more

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
them and that can make it even more

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.230 
them and that can make it even more
crazy<00:06:21.020> but<00:06:21.440> you're<00:06:21.949> paying<00:06:22.099> for<00:06:22.280> genetics<00:06:22.970> and

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
crazy but you're paying for genetics and

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.390 
crazy but you're paying for genetics and
you<00:06:23.810> paying<00:06:24.080> for<00:06:24.320> all<00:06:24.590> these<00:06:25.099> good<00:06:25.370> things

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
you paying for all these good things

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.980 
you paying for all these good things
that<00:06:25.759> come<00:06:26.000> with<00:06:26.180> quality<00:06:26.539> breeder<00:06:26.840> for

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
that come with quality breeder for

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
that come with quality breeder for
itself<00:06:27.349> I<00:06:27.680> think<00:06:28.220> it's<00:06:28.310> worth<00:06:28.490> it<00:06:29.260> so<00:06:30.260> those

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
itself I think it's worth it so those

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.409 
itself I think it's worth it so those
are<00:06:31.220> the<00:06:31.250> three<00:06:31.340> ways<00:06:31.699> that<00:06:32.000> you<00:06:32.030> can<00:06:32.240> get<00:06:32.360> a

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
ferret there are other places like back

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.020 
ferret there are other places like back
drug<00:06:35.270> for<00:06:35.539> years<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:36.220> going<00:06:37.220> to<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.610> place<00:06:37.820> like

Craigslist<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:38.840> finding<00:06:39.320> spirit<00:06:39.740> but<00:06:40.580> these

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
Craigslist and finding spirit but these

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.850 
Craigslist and finding spirit but these
are<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.360> three<00:06:41.630> main<00:06:41.810> ways<00:06:42.050> if<00:06:42.440> you<00:06:42.620> want<00:06:42.770> me
