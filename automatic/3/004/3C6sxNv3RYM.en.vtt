obviously my mistake and I simply have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.490 
obviously my mistake and I simply have
to<00:01:19.680> accept<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.549> blame<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.119> goal

but I think we showed a good team effort
following<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.200> great<00:01:25.350> team

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
following that see we have great team
spirit<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.150> evident

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
spirit and by on I think it was evident
