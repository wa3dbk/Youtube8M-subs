install some shift cables there's two
different<00:00:12.809> kind<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.990> cables<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.380> there<00:00:13.590> one

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
different kind of cables out there one

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.670 
different kind of cables out there one
is<00:00:14.190> shift<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> brake<00:00:15.379> shift<00:00:16.379> cables

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
is shift and one is a brake shift cables

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
is shift and one is a brake shift cables
are<00:00:16.770> linear<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.220> they<00:00:17.580> go<00:00:17.730> straight<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
are linear and they go straight in and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.120 
are linear and they go straight in and
out<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.230> brake<00:00:19.410> cable<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.800> more<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.039> a
