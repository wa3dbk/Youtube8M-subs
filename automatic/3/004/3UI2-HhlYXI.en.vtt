00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.590
 let's go to chapter 8 then 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.050
 let's learn how to configure the server a clue 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.500
 I've already said that mind is a service of tcp / ip protocol very similar to bns 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.549
 the icon summits pcp and pev according to names of tennis and guarantees the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.699
 maintenance and replication of the name of existing names in the network 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 come on let's set up billions then 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.739
 come on, let's start 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.599
 Software 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.919
 administrative tools 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.919
 and an entity is the last item to hit 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.150
 if you observe 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.700
 the ones the bad server that already that until you had that up saying that he 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.900
 is in full operation we are going to stay here and more we will observe that yes 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.570
 active record 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.570
 and duplication partner 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.480
 we will right click and server 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 and we go on properties 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.440
 akin get general there is command to decapitate bank fingerprints sick let's have 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.660
 put up backup of kept will put the directory our strike mine 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.660
 will be the cebas points 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.420
 the index 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 Let's go, yes, bank check. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.960
 let's put it so that it checks the consistency of the database 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.710
 every 24 hours 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.160
 let's put 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 to apply 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.090
 and we're going to go there now 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.820
 never colloquy 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 to record detailed winds soon to disappear said he will leave the event 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.330
 too slow 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.750
 Let's leave it the way it is 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 and let's squeeze a little bit 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.350
 We are going to close 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.270
 and now we will initialize the service many initial moments 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.740
 Software 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 administrative assistant manager 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 let's use the screen more 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.529
 let's keep it 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.219
 is that I only served right click on it 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.789
 We're staying at 15 a.m. 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.789
 point to initial selections 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.499
 is working perfectly
