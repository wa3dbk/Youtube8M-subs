00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.400
The T26E4 Super Pershing is an American medium tank in Tier VIII.

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:13.933
Since the game was released it has been showered with universal love and bitter hatred.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:20.400
But its most distinctive feature always stayed the same: it was never a “regular tank”.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.467
The premium tanks in our game are always a little different.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.933
“Unique gameplay” is often the way we describe it.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:41.433
Here that means a little more.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:51.667
Any premium tank is just a tank: shooting, driving, and pwning, but!

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:54.267
There’s always, always a catch!

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.767
And for the Pershing it’s the speed.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:09.100
Take a peek at its combat characteristics, and you’ll see its maximum speed of 40 km/h.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.833
40 kilometers!

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.567
To put it mildly, that’s not much.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.833
Keep in mind this is a medium tank.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.100
And even worse is the fact that once you leave the Garage and enter a battle…

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.100
you’ll realize that the Pershing never reaches that maximum speed… ever!

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:37.633
32 km/h is all you can get from this American if it’s not going down a hill!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.000
The Super Pershing has less than 10 horsepower per ton, which makes it the slowest tank within its type.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.467
Looking outside of its type, it’s even inferior to heavy tanks!

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:55.500
And we aren’t talking about some AMX 50 100.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:02:02.267
The IS-3, a Soviet heavy, can easily beat the American in a straight line.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.067
And you can forget climbing hills too.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.967
But there is something of note.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:14.900
Our “not-quite-medium tank” gains speed faster when it’s going backwards rather than forwards!

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:21.833
You can still climb the hill facing either way, but it’ll be equally as slow.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.567
So you’ll suffer whichever way you approach the enemy.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.133
Why does this happen?

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:37.400
That’s easy: the Super Pershing is covered in so much armor that it just can’t move that fast.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:44.467
This American’s turret is an unusual shape, so it’s very hard to penetrate, even in the weak points.

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:51.333
Not that its weak points are stronger than other tanks—but they still have to hit them!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.100
The daunting BL-10 hits them 4 times out of 10.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.867
In other cases, the shell either misses or fails to penetrate.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.000
Armor-piercing shells, but it doesn’t penetrate!

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:13.633
It’s another story with APCR, they can penetrate anything.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:17.500
Who uses APCR with a BL-10 though?

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:26.267
A cast iron turret and good angles allow the Super Pershing to be comfortable behind hills.

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:31.967
On Himmelsdorf, it can simply stick out its turret… and fire!

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:36.300
Most of the enemies won’t be able to do a thing!

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.733
Within the entire tier, only the Super Pershing and the T32 can manage this.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:48.067
Well, the T-32, with its turret and elevation angles, can do this.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.067
But nobody can do THIS!

00:03:55.267 --> 00:04:00.900
In reality, the Super Pershing’s front plates were made from the sides of a knocked out Panther.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.100
And they were made with several layers.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.900
And we mean several.

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:13.800
If you calculate the effective armor on its upper front plate, it comes out at a daunting 300 mm!

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:21.900
It’s impossible to calculate it more accurately, but one thing is clear, it’s one of the thickest in Tier VIII!

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.467
But there’s a catch.

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:29.567
Isn’t that like having a top quality barbecue and living in Greenland?

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:36.900
I mean, how often are you hit on your upper front plate?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.533
Once or twice a month?

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:43.467
Even the beginners know that the most vulnerable spot is the lower plate!

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.700
Usually…

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.767
Not for the Pershing!

00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:54.233
The lower plate is made in the same way as the upper one, so it’s almost as strong.

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:57.033
This armor knows no equal!

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:00.600
Well, you won’t fool the more experienced players.

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:11.867
But the first move of many players is to fire at the lower plate!

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:15.100
No penetration, what a surprise.

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:20.167
Remember that the Pershing has a hard face and a soft behind.

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:26.967
The armor is what makes the Pershing a real frontline tank.

00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:31.500
Yes, this is a medium tank, but it does a heavy tank’s job.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.233
Think that’s strange?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:38.100
However, it’s easy to explain: the Super Pershing is pretty heavy!

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.367
You can’t really call it a medium.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.567
All characteristics shout that it’s heavy.

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:58.667
There are some other paradoxes like that in World of Tanks.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:13.367
For example, the Super Pershing is a medium tank as much as the FCM is a heavy tank.

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:16.833
The only thing medium about the Super Pershing is its gun.

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:19.833
And it’s unbelievably normal.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:23.433
It’s strange to see something so standard on a tank like this!

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.533
Average aiming speed, average accuracy, average alpha: a standard medium tank.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.933
But a Pershing isn’t a Pershing if there isn’t anything to show off!

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:37.033
One little thing: penetration!

00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:43.167
There’s a big difference between the characteristics of AP and APCR shells.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:51.200
AP shells manage 170 mm, and APCR go much further: 258!

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.467
That’s really impressive.

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:57.300
And enough for any enemy the Super Pershing might encounter.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.167
The worst case is a Tier IX enemy.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:03.233
It’s meant to be placed at the forefront.

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:12.133
Tease the enemy with its face, and take 3 to 4 thousand damage, that’s its role in battle.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:15.200
Don’t be too creative, simply face the enemy.

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:18.033
No diamonds, or angled positions.

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:22.500
You are going to be hit in the tracks before you find the right position.

00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:30.700
Well, it won’t hold the front alone.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.033
But be honest, who can?

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:42.000
Just remember that if you need someone to distract enemies and absorb damage, that’s the Pershing.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.100
It’s among the few tanks which you can almost call “impenetrable”

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.100
What a shame it will never meet the Bat.-Châtillon!
