00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.190
 welcome fm oviedo task from diego lozano counted eat the video 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.530
 previous tutorial we learned how they got on their website 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.040
 from the same penalty and that harper now let's learn how they got on their 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.570
 website from another way that is what I've done I actually recommend what 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.110
 first thing we're going to do is continue to publish our website okello mozart 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.280
 will be published in which the local directory 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.929
 we were going to say in public we hope 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.550
 and it has already been published nothing to lie because we have it there to all the archives 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 including what is the contact form now we wanted the degree 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.159
 because on that website it will no longer be necessary to have what I say open 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.280
 before leaving so simply loins when closing 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 we will do and what not 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.850
 or that since it is here we have our entire website 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.830
 very good percent then what we need is this program coke the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.510
 program is called deceased and is completely free we can not search 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.180
 directly something goal 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.330
 you put died 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.210
 and it looks for city to be able to enter to the web of the creator somebody 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.530
 you can download the windows version 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.840
 of the deceased 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 operates from what you have on your computer and with the same data as us 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.940
 we want 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.680
 percent had at the time of creating our fp account but let's enter 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.190
 to the deceased 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 what we will first put the name of the server in this area here 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.250
 well before continuing you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.350
 I have to clarify that the deceased basically has 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.720
 let's say it like that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.940
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.010
 let's see 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.110
 the five panels because first of all we have on that side of here all the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.090
 tools 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.430
 ok and on this other side of here we will have some notifications of 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.160
 connection to a server 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.890
 because in this area in that other one I will have just had all the files that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.399
 there is 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.330
 in our computer 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.050
 because there in this other face area on the right side we have or the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.060
 archives that there are in ee 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.540
 internet what on our server 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.910
 and in this one a small area store that we're going to have 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.960
 what are the notifications of failed transfers 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.779
 i percent 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.279
 and the history of the whole society in the presence of factors including 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.379
 as well 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.740
 what I know that the waiting time that 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.899
 we're going to have 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:18.719
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.749
 What to expect true separation I keep x 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.079
 OK so 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.909
 the first thing we have to do is connect your fee to our server 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.529
 gay for it does not prevent the first the name of our server 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.099
 the name of our server as to show that it really is this 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.379
 from ftp 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.889
 point of a point lion is a point with control to hit me 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.939
 of euros but the username 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 as we have seen earlier this 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.709
 we place 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.489
 iniesta password 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 and the port we put port 21 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.789
 now they have fast connection 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.879
 we wait for it to connect as it is 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.859
 we already have in this pair of all the odile files which are 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.280
 composed our website now what we're going to do is erase them completely 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.859
 that as it is repeated in erase 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.229
 we do not tolerate clients in suffering 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.559
 to erase them 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.559
 we say yes they did delete all the files 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.489
 we hope that all are deleted 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.169
 you are erasing we can 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 by blind search what is 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.379
 what is ours is not the website locally as it is 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.370
 to each citizen is a left side are on your website the same site 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.909
 Web 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.590
 just that what we have in that range 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.399
 busy now 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.219
 that as we are in and advance percent desktop 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.060
 explains culson pleca temple where where is 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.730
 our website hosted on our hard drive that on that computer 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.079
 and what we need is to pass it to the right side ask for side here 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.759
 to upload the internet 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.759
 before we are going to tie on your website 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.629
 let's refresh the page 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.969
 and as he says no to everything he asked that the fringed absolutely all parents 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:13.619
 children 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.790
 Okay then, we're going to be 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 select all files here 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 we are going to win here the immense click on the first file or folder that 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.889
 have control icons 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.240
 to say that with the arrows down we select it completely 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.939
 everyone 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.139
 and now the 'paras' stretches all 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.050
 made this panel decade that easy 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.779
 this suggests on our website 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.059
 to Internet 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.059
 using what is deceased 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.570
 and here we are also seeing what makes the forum 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.940
 contact molarÃ­a that we are joining 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.949
 only the files on our website 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.080
 that make up the website itself but also formulates the form's 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.180
 contact that there are three ex-grounds 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.830
 what we expect is that only as ezeldina says how many more going up 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.180
 it's already completely finished up on your website 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.469
 hello girl refresh the page 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.160
 we will not be able to visualize 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.380
 again our website but 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.000
 his life from the church 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 or what and now we are going to go to the contact 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:23.139
 and as you can see now this is what is the contact form 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.349
 correctly 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.349
 l on our site 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.719
 we must always verify that everything works 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.360
 as we want 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.089
 i once here we already have 100 that website when uploading a post 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.089
 it would only be missing what will be proved in it what is the contact form 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.050
 however, that task that I will leave here 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.349
 or to go I hope you enjoyed this little mini-bus that we have created 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.949
 what we were going to follow created the belligerents remember who the hell to 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:55.800

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.870
 what he is 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.699
 Jose's plans are more comfortable though and as president at 1 99 at a time it is a 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.819
 super economic plan and cost 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.009
 even for one in prey 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.669
