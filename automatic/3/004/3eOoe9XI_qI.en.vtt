 more or less 10 degrees but this does not 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.400
 prevents us from practicing the board 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.260

 this sport started here in floripa is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.390
 then in fact the original idea was 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.150
 one of the Americans as most of the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.910

 came here to floripa and here 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 the first boards 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.520
 proportion of own goals to the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.720
 that the bottom is different is that the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.700
 started to develop the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.770
