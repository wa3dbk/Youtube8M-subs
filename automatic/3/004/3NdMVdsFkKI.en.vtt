to<00:00:07.330> the<00:00:07.420> clinic<00:00:07.780> today<00:00:07.990> in<00:00:08.320> Cardiff<00:00:08.679> except

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
to the clinic today in Cardiff except

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.880 
to the clinic today in Cardiff except
appointment<00:00:09.490> 12:30<00:00:09.970> for<00:00:10.269> it<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.350> be<00:00:11.440> done<00:00:11.590> I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:11.890 
appointment 12:30 for it to be done I

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.320 
appointment 12:30 for it to be done I
didn't<00:00:12.370> actually<00:00:12.490> go<00:00:12.730> through<00:00:12.970> that<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
didn't actually go through that the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.940 
didn't actually go through that the
reason<00:00:13.690> being<00:00:13.900> is<00:00:14.050> because<00:00:14.080> it<00:00:14.500> really<00:00:14.800> would

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
reason being is because it really would

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.790 
reason being is because it really would
have<00:00:15.040> taken<00:00:15.610> around<00:00:16.359> about<00:00:16.750> six<00:00:17.080> treatments

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
have taken around about six treatments

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.130 
have taken around about six treatments
for<00:00:17.920> me<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.220> have<00:00:18.340> seen<00:00:18.640> a<00:00:18.880> benefit<00:00:19.690> from<00:00:19.869> this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
for me to have seen a benefit from this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.170 
for me to have seen a benefit from this
treatment<00:00:20.890> that<00:00:21.160> they<00:00:21.400> were<00:00:21.460> talking<00:00:21.910> about

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
treatment that they were talking about

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.300 
treatment that they were talking about
and<00:00:22.600> those<00:00:23.199> six<00:00:23.440> treatments<00:00:23.770> would<00:00:24.160> have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
and those six treatments would have

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.859 
and those six treatments would have
built<00:00:24.550> up<00:00:24.760> to<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.000> lot<00:00:25.240> of<00:00:25.270> money<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:25.810> that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
built up to a lot of money and that

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.140 
built up to a lot of money and that
money<00:00:26.619> I<00:00:26.920> could<00:00:27.279> have<00:00:27.369> spent<00:00:27.580> on<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.820> laser

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
money I could have spent on a laser

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.090 
money I could have spent on a laser
treatment<00:00:28.660> instead<00:00:29.050> because<00:00:29.770> it<00:00:29.890> would<00:00:30.010> have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
treatment instead because it would have

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.159 
treatment instead because it would have
built<00:00:30.369> up<00:00:30.609> to<00:00:30.850> that<00:00:31.029> kind<00:00:31.269> of<00:00:31.420> money<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:31.660> I

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
built up to that kind of money so I

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.410 
built up to that kind of money so I
decided<00:00:32.829> against<00:00:33.220> that<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.790> rather<00:00:34.000> I'm

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
decided against that and rather I'm

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.030 
decided against that and rather I'm
gonna<00:00:34.630> go<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:34.960> have<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.140> laser<00:00:35.440> treatment<00:00:35.710> is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
gonna go and have a laser treatment is

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.650 
gonna go and have a laser treatment is
there<00:00:36.250> because<00:00:36.430> it's<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.820> same<00:00:37.030> price<00:00:37.300> for

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
there because it's the same price for

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.900 
there because it's the same price for
one<00:00:38.440> laser<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:38.950> is<00:00:39.010> for<00:00:39.340> six<00:00:39.550> of<00:00:39.730> those

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
one laser it is for six of those

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.639 
one laser it is for six of those
treatments<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:40.780> I'd<00:00:40.960> rather<00:00:41.110> just<00:00:41.350> get<00:00:41.500> the

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
treatments so I'd rather just get the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.130 
treatments so I'd rather just get the
laser<00:00:41.829> done<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.460> be<00:00:42.640> done<00:00:42.790> with<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:43.030> on<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
laser done and be done with it on the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.709 
laser done and be done with it on the
downtime<00:00:44.640> excuse<00:00:45.640> me<00:00:45.790> I<00:00:45.850> was<00:00:45.969> speaking<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.360> Kay

she says that the downtime can be
anything<00:00:49.660> from<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:50.050> day<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.590> about<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.670> week<00:00:51.910> but

when I say gametime what that really

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.130 
when I say gametime what that really
means<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.610> skin<00:00:54.910> will<00:00:55.090> have<00:00:55.329> can<00:00:55.840> have<00:00:55.989> the

means is the skin will have can have the
marks<00:00:56.530> where<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.770> laser<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.309> hit<00:00:57.579> now<00:00:58.329> they

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
marks where the laser is hit now they

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.299 
marks where the laser is hit now they
can<00:00:58.750> be<00:00:58.870> covered<00:00:59.140> up<00:00:59.260> immediately<00:00:59.620> with

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
can be covered up immediately with

know all the other things that lasers

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.739 
know all the other things that lasers
can<00:01:15.459> do<00:01:15.639> so<00:01:15.819> that's<00:01:15.999> what<00:01:16.149> I'm<00:01:16.329> going<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.539> do

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
see the results from it of what the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.459 
see the results from it of what the
treatment<00:01:24.700> looks<00:01:25.060> like<00:01:25.299> what<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:25.959> feels<00:01:26.259> like

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
treatment looks like what it feels like

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.039 
treatment looks like what it feels like
and<00:01:26.859> of<00:01:27.340> course<00:01:27.369> as<00:01:27.999> we<00:01:28.359> go<00:01:28.389> along<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
and of course as we go along the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.300 
and of course as we go along the
benefits<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.679> it<00:01:29.799> because<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.099> going<00:01:30.249> to

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
benefits of it because it's going to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.550 
benefits of it because it's going to
take<00:01:30.520> around<00:01:30.759> about<00:01:30.849> six<00:01:31.270> weeks<00:01:31.389> for<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.319> full

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
take around about six weeks for the full

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.319 
take around about six weeks for the full
benefits<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.099> that<00:01:33.279> laser<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.789> be<00:01:33.939> seen<00:01:34.149> and

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
benefits of that laser to be seen and

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.789 
benefits of that laser to be seen and
I'm<00:01:34.419> going<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.569> go<00:01:34.719> for<00:01:34.929> three<00:01:35.139> sessions<00:01:35.380> which

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
I'm going to go for three sessions which

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.769 
I'm going to go for three sessions which
are<00:01:35.919> the<00:01:36.009> recommended<00:01:36.549> three<00:01:36.819> anyway<00:01:37.240> and

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
are the recommended three anyway and

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.149 
are the recommended three anyway and
we'll<00:01:38.289> see<00:01:38.469> where<00:01:38.649> we<00:01:38.740> go

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
we'll see where we go

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.800 
we'll see where we go
obviously<00:01:39.669> the<00:01:39.789> areas<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.179> want<00:01:40.389> to<00:01:40.509> improve

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
obviously the areas I want to improve

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.919 
obviously the areas I want to improve
are<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.529> ice<00:01:41.859> I<00:01:42.189> want<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.999> under-eye<00:01:43.479> bag<00:01:43.749> to

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
are the ice I want the under-eye bag to

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.769 
are the ice I want the under-eye bag to
be<00:01:44.020> completely<00:01:44.520> eliminated<00:01:45.520> if<00:01:45.639> possible<00:01:46.149> or

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:46.779 
be completely eliminated if possible or

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.629 
be completely eliminated if possible or
the<00:01:47.259> very<00:01:47.469> least<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:47.889> skin<00:01:48.130> under<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.609> a

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
the very least the skin under it to be a

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.940 
the very least the skin under it to be a
lot<00:01:48.849> tighter<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.479> was<00:01:49.630> my<00:01:49.779> main<00:01:49.989> concern<00:01:50.020> so

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
lot tighter that was my main concern so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.469 
lot tighter that was my main concern so
I'm<00:01:51.099> going<00:01:51.279> to<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.429> for<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.789> I'm<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.389> to

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
I'm going to go for it I'm going to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.760 
I'm going to go for it I'm going to
record<00:01:52.779> it<00:01:52.929> if<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.169> can<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.529> get<00:01:53.649> that

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
record it if I can and get that

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.779 
record it if I can and get that
permission<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.459> I<00:01:54.759> will<00:01:56.489> document<00:01:57.489> the<00:01:57.549> whole
