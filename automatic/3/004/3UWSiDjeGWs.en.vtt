00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800

 This week is still Michelle reporter

 Gourmet Country France If you come to France, eat delicious authentic French cuisine 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.860
 It looks like 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.230
 However, there are many Japanese people who do not understand words and customs or who are confused by anxiety 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.380
 Is not there 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.610
 there 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:50.650
 I would like to introduce you how to enjoy the restaurant in 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 The popular and casual brasserie les congres near the Arc de Triomphe 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.510
 Let's get lost and get lunch 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.989
 dee 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 I can not sit in a vacant seat when I enter the shop 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 Let's wait until shop people come If you are making a reservation If you are not making a reserved name 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.150
 Let's tell the number of people 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.320
 If you can not use words 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.070
 With your finger 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 Seed is 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 N Gooding 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.290
 Is jaf 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.940
 It will be understood if it conveys like this 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 You'll be spying if you go to Seto 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.570
 Good 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.010

 Moose Salarom Hyun View customers 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.210
 The person in the shop brings the menu like this 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 The menu is unless Niu-time in French means that set meal in reverse 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.000
 I wonder what I should choose this 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.740
 Seafood is a specialty of French brush 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.480
 So the first page of the menu is usually seafood 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.480
 There are various things such as raw oysters 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.850
 It looks like a menu that looks difficult at first glance, but it's almost a configuration that is nowhere 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.360
 First appetizer 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.790
 To the refrigerator

 Irupu Lapa Parry 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.900
 This is a fish 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.530
 And 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530
 Sony stock 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.270
 And three eyes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 Arm will be a dessert 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:57.180
 There are many people who think that it is a French Japanese-style course, but it is not so and the condition of the stomach is empty 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.900
 Appetizers and main dishes alone or together with dessert 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.740
 You can also order the Fu that it or Sakenatake 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 In the menu 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:17.700
 In this case it is here that there is a set meal of page 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.310
 This job change is daily or weekly, but the choice is limited, but usually 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.440
 It is advantageous in price 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.090
 The other menu is simmering and I asked for wine as I came to France . 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.989
 Let's go 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.090
 Wine is a bottleless 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:40.280
 Semibotoru or aircraft shell This would be a thing of the 600 parent-child 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.240
 You can ask for it with a troop glass 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 By the way, tap water and bread are free in France 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.520
 We will work as much as you like 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.170
 It is serious chart when you want to ask for water 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.860
 Let's say and ask 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.860
 me 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.950
 uh
