00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey youtube today we're going to try and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.079 
hey youtube today we're going to try and
repair<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.750> speaker<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> clip

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
repair this speaker here this is a clip

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.089 
repair this speaker here this is a clip
pro<00:00:07.080> media<00:00:07.350> 2.1<00:00:08.960> surround<00:00:09.960> sound<00:00:10.260> speaker<00:00:10.830> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
pro media 2.1 surround sound speaker and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.950 
pro media 2.1 surround sound speaker and
I<00:00:11.969> believe<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.450> version<00:00:12.780> 2.1<00:00:14.179> and<00:00:15.179> i<00:00:15.750> pick

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
I believe it's version 2.1 and i pick

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.519 
I believe it's version 2.1 and i pick
this<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.289> broken<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.949> craigslist<00:00:17.779> and<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
this up broken on craigslist and the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
this up broken on craigslist and the
problem<00:00:20.039> ends<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.460> being<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.480> you've<00:00:21.600> got<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
problem ends up being so you've got the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.730 
problem ends up being so you've got the
control<00:00:22.230> pod<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.369> wire<00:00:24.560> if<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
control pod here in this wire if you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
control pod here in this wire if you
look<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:27.380> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.279> broken<00:00:29.670> off

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
look in here you can see it's broken off

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
look in here you can see it's broken off
and<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> sub<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and back here on the back of the sub is

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.750 
and back here on the back of the sub is
the<00:00:33.570> remainder<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> plug<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.340> apparently

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the remainder of the plug so apparently

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.000 
the remainder of the plug so apparently
the<00:00:35.850> previous<00:00:36.329> owner<00:00:36.570> stepped<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> kicked

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the previous owner stepped on it kicked

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
the previous owner stepped on it kicked
on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> wire<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.670> something<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on the wire or something like that and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
on the wire or something like that and
pulled<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.550> oddly<00:00:41.550> enough<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
pulled it out and oddly enough this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.270 
pulled it out and oddly enough this
apparently<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:43.440> common<00:00:43.680> failure

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
apparently is a really common failure

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
apparently is a really common failure
you<00:00:44.850> search<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> internet<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.899> find

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you search on the internet and you find

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.420 
you search on the internet and you find
a<00:00:46.200> lot<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.530> people<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> similar<00:00:47.399> problem

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a lot of people with a similar problem

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
a lot of people with a similar problem
to<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.980> I'm

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to this so I'm going to go through I'm

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
to this so I'm going to go through I'm
going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> solder<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> new<00:00:51.660> connector<00:00:52.350> on

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
going to solder on a new connector on

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to solder on a new connector on
here<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.640> also<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.420> check

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here I'm also going to have to check

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
here I'm also going to have to check
this<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> circuit<00:00:56.340> board<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.610> make<00:00:56.789> sure

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this on the circuit board here make sure

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
this on the circuit board here make sure
there's<00:00:57.090> no<00:00:57.239> broken<00:00:57.420> traces<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.710> we'll<00:00:59.250> go

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there's no broken traces and we'll go

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
there's no broken traces and we'll go
ahead<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> whole<00:00:59.940> thing<00:00:59.969> apart<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
ahead and take the whole thing apart and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
ahead and take the whole thing apart and
see<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.500> there's<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:01.949> caps<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> be

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
see if there's any caps that need to be

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.990 
see if there's any caps that need to be
replaced<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.690> any<00:01:03.840> other<00:01:04.019> problems<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.830> yeah<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
replaced or any other problems so yeah I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
replaced or any other problems so yeah I
guess<00:01:06.299> step<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> let's<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> ahead<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
guess step one is let's go ahead and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.620 
guess step one is let's go ahead and
pull<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.360> that's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pull this out and so this here that's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380 
pull this out and so this here that's
what<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> connector<00:01:17.460> looks<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.270> need

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
what the connector looks like so we need

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
what the connector looks like so we need
to<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> new<00:01:19.799> connector<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to get a new connector like that and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
to get a new connector like that and
solder<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.540> up

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.610 

and<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> inside<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> pod

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
and this is what the inside of the pod

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.340 
and this is what the inside of the pod
looks<00:01:29.010> like<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.510> small<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> circuit

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
looks like just a small of a circuit

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.240 
looks like just a small of a circuit
board<00:01:32.570> we<00:01:33.570> went<00:01:33.750> through<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.230> snot<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.070> up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
board we went through and snot it up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.690 
board we went through and snot it up
every<00:01:36.000> capacitor<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> board

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
every capacitor on here but the board

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.080 
every capacitor on here but the board
itself<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:40.160> don't<00:01:41.160> see<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.430> problems<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.940> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
itself I don't see any problems on the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
itself I don't see any problems on the
board<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.260> use<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.770> ESR<00:01:44.640> meter<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
board and I use the ESR meter and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.400 
board and I use the ESR meter and
checked<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> caps<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.050> everything

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
checked all the caps and everything

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.040 
checked all the caps and everything
checks<00:01:46.650> out<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.980> this<00:01:47.130> board<00:01:47.400> so<00:01:48.210> unless<00:01:48.810> these

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
checks out on this board so unless these

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.080 
checks out on this board so unless these
potentiometers<00:01:49.980> are<00:01:50.160> dirty<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.550> think<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
potentiometers are dirty I think this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.080 
potentiometers are dirty I think this
board<00:01:51.480> is<00:01:51.690> good<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:55.550> I've<00:01:56.550> gone<00:01:56.760> ahead<00:01:56.940> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
board is good to go I've gone ahead and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.180 
board is good to go I've gone ahead and
taken<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.810> panel<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> subwoofer

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
taken the back panel off the subwoofer

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.170 
taken the back panel off the subwoofer
here<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> had<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> look<00:02:00.869> inside<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.180> first

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
here and had a look inside and first

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.130 
here and had a look inside and first
thing<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.420> noticed<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.190> pod<00:02:06.140> every

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
thing I noticed just like the pod every

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.169 
thing I noticed just like the pod every
single<00:02:07.560> capacitor<00:02:07.910> resistors<00:02:08.910> about

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
single capacitor resistors about

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.470 
single capacitor resistors about
everything<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.050> gunked<00:02:10.560> down<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.480> compound

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
everything is gunked down with compound

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320 
everything is gunked down with compound
which<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.560> first<00:02:13.830> seemed<00:02:14.100> overkill<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.030> now

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
which it first seemed overkill but now

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.060 
which it first seemed overkill but now
they<00:02:15.480> think<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> speaker

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
they think about it it is a speaker

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.970 
they think about it it is a speaker
there's<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> lot<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> vibration<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.260> all<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
there's a lot of vibration so all of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
there's a lot of vibration so all of
that<00:02:20.130> compound<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.760> hold<00:02:20.910> things<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.240> place

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that compound to hold things in place

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.410 
that compound to hold things in place
kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> makes<00:02:22.020> sense<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.670> every<00:02:23.760> capacitor

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
kind of makes sense in every capacitor

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020 
kind of makes sense in every capacitor
looks<00:02:24.720> good<00:02:25.080> tests<00:02:25.650> fine<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> don't<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.880> any

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
looks good tests fine I don't see any

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.380 
looks good tests fine I don't see any
problems<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:29.670> where<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.030> plug

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
problems in here here where this plug

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.440 
problems in here here where this plug
comes<00:02:30.810> over<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.070> solder<00:02:32.519> joints<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.300> they

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
comes over the solder joints here they

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.990 
comes over the solder joints here they
look<00:02:33.720> fine<00:02:34.050> I'll<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.620> any<00:02:34.769> problems<00:02:35.250> I'll

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
look fine I'll see any problems I'll

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
look fine I'll see any problems I'll
still<00:02:36.330> probably<00:02:36.560> touch<00:02:37.560> them<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.010> with<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
still probably touch them up with a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.890 
still probably touch them up with a
little<00:02:38.459> bit<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.580> fresh<00:02:38.880> slaughter<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
little bit of fresh slaughter but I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.400 
little bit of fresh slaughter but I
don't<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.680> any<00:02:40.830> cracks<00:02:41.130> odder<00:02:41.489> joints<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
don't see any cracks odder joints so I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.270 
don't see any cracks odder joints so I
think<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.280> replace<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.239> plug<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
think really just replace that plug and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.840 
think really just replace that plug and
the<00:02:47.280> subwoofer<00:02:47.730> should<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.690> fine<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the subwoofer should work fine so the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.729 
the subwoofer should work fine so the
repair<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.420> subwoofer<00:02:54.959> took<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> couple<00:02:55.500> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
repair on the subwoofer took a couple of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.789 
repair on the subwoofer took a couple of
twists<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.220> turns<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.640> was<00:02:56.820> unexpected<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
twists and turns that was unexpected to

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.320 
twists and turns that was unexpected to
repair<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.010> plug<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.640> back<00:02:59.790> my<00:03:00.090> first

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
repair the plug in the back my first

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.750 
repair the plug in the back my first
thought<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.049> use<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.590> which<00:03:02.549> is

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
thought was to use this which is

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.460 
thought was to use this which is
basically<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.950> tiny<00:03:05.370> little<00:03:06.019> plug<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.290> you

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
basically the tiny little plug that you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.350 
basically the tiny little plug that you
can<00:03:07.650> solder<00:03:07.920> wires<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> back<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.299> you

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
can solder wires on to the back and you

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240 
can solder wires on to the back and you
can<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.750> assemble<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.560> together<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.130> it's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
can just assemble it together and it's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
can just assemble it together and it's
basically<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.820> replacement<00:03:12.239> for<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.930> plug

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
basically a replacement for the plug

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.350 
basically a replacement for the plug
that's<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> problem<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.269> was

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
that's on there and the problem I was

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.180 
that's on there and the problem I was
running<00:03:15.750> into<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.640> these<00:03:17.640> wires<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.690> very

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
running into is these wires are very

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.949 
running into is these wires are very
small<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.459> here<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.820> solder<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.900> I

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
small back here to solder on to and I

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.930 
small back here to solder on to and I
was<00:03:22.080> actually<00:03:22.260> melting<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> housing<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
was actually melting the housing and the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.539 
was actually melting the housing and the
pins<00:03:24.239> were<00:03:24.450> getting<00:03:24.720> deformed<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.250> very

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
pins were getting deformed so very

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.400 
pins were getting deformed so very
quickly<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.970> realized<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> too

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
quickly I realized that this is just too

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.009 
quickly I realized that this is just too
small<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.730> having<00:03:30.000> no<00:03:30.150> luck<00:03:30.360> soldering<00:03:30.810> my

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
small I was having no luck soldering my

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.460 
small I was having no luck soldering my
so<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.130> next<00:03:32.370> thought<00:03:32.549> was<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.470> connectors

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
so my next thought was that connectors

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.120 
so my next thought was that connectors
the<00:03:35.010> same<00:03:35.250> size<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> ps/2<00:03:36.360> connector<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:38.099> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
the same size as a ps/2 connector so I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.950 
the same size as a ps/2 connector so I
thought<00:03:38.430> cut<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.060> end<00:03:39.209> of

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
thought cut the end of

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.320 
thought cut the end of
keyboard<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:41.340> solder<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.150> wires

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
keyboard and then solder the wires

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.630 
keyboard and then solder the wires
together<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:43.470> which<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.800> lot<00:03:44.040> easier<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
together here which is a lot easier to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.430 
together here which is a lot easier to
sort<00:03:44.910> our<00:03:45.000> two<00:03:45.180> wires<00:03:45.360> together<00:03:45.630> than<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.200> try

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
sort our two wires together than to try

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.820 
sort our two wires together than to try
and<00:03:46.470> go<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.710> this<00:03:46.920> tiny<00:03:47.520> little<00:03:47.700> pin<00:03:48.740> on<00:03:49.740> the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
and go to this tiny little pin on the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.220 
and go to this tiny little pin on the
problem<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.190> ran<00:03:50.400> into<00:03:50.460> there<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.050> are

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
problem I ran into there so there are

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.740 
problem I ran into there so there are
six<00:03:52.740> wires<00:03:53.460> down<00:03:53.760> there<00:03:54.000> plus<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.420> outer

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
six wires down there plus the outer

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.290 
six wires down there plus the outer
ground<00:03:55.260> sleeve<00:03:55.790> yet<00:03:56.790> when<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.000> cut<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
ground sleeve yet when I cut the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.030 
ground sleeve yet when I cut the
keyboard<00:03:57.690> wire<00:03:58.590> open<00:03:59.030> there<00:04:00.030> are<00:04:00.470> four<00:04:01.470> was<00:04:01.920> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
keyboard wire open there are four was it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.340 
keyboard wire open there are four was it
five<00:04:02.280> wires<00:04:02.490> in<00:04:02.850> there<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.750> there's<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.140> number

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
five wires in there so there's a number

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.490 
five wires in there so there's a number
of<00:04:04.560> wires<00:04:04.770> missing<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:06.350> cable<00:04:07.350> just

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
of wires missing so this cable just

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.820 
of wires missing so this cable just
physically<00:04:08.130> won't<00:04:08.340> work<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:10.110> what<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> ended<00:04:10.710> up

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
physically won't work so what I ended up

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.100 
physically won't work so what I ended up
doing<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.700> kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.000> hesitant<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.570> do<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.870> but

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
doing it's kind of hesitant to do it but

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.770 
doing it's kind of hesitant to do it but
I<00:04:13.320> drilled<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.890> hole<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> case<00:04:14.520> here<00:04:14.910> ran

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
I drilled a hole in the case here ran

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.380 
I drilled a hole in the case here ran
the<00:04:15.990> wire<00:04:16.170> through<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:18.000> literally

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
the wire through and then literally

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.690 
the wire through and then literally
direct<00:04:19.080> solder<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.620> everything<00:04:20.010> onto<00:04:20.520> the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
direct solder to everything onto the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.390 
direct solder to everything onto the
circuit<00:04:21.060> board<00:04:21.270> there<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.980> there's<00:04:23.190> not<00:04:23.340> a

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
circuit board there and there's not a

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.420 
circuit board there and there's not a
lot<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.670> what<00:04:23.820> light<00:04:24.180> hard<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.720> see<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.430> just

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
lot of what light hard to see but just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.140 
lot of what light hard to see but just
do<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.000> then<00:04:27.150> right<00:04:27.510> here<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:28.850> put<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> zip

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
do that and then right here I put a zip

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.060 
do that and then right here I put a zip
tie<00:04:30.420> on<00:04:30.720> there<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.200> tight<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.860> kind

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
tie on there really tight and that kind

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.420 
tie on there really tight and that kind
of<00:04:32.130> acts<00:04:32.280> as<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.600> cable<00:04:33.600> strain<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.620> if<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.040> tug

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
of acts as a cable strain so if you tug

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.830 
of acts as a cable strain so if you tug
on<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.760> it's<00:04:35.970> not<00:04:36.150> going<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.390> pull<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
on it it's not going to pull on the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.110 
on it it's not going to pull on the
wires<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.440> circuit<00:04:37.830> board<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.790> tugs

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
wires on the circuit board it it tugs

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.460 
wires on the circuit board it it tugs
right<00:04:39.360> there<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:40.530> let's<00:04:41.460> go<00:04:41.550> ahead<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.470> we've

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
right there so let's go ahead and we've

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.440 
right there so let's go ahead and we've
got<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.860> all<00:04:43.950> hooked<00:04:44.250> up<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.790> let's<00:04:45.090> turn<00:04:45.330> it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
got it all hooked up here let's turn it

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.600 
got it all hooked up here let's turn it
on<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.630> see<00:04:45.840> what<00:04:45.990> happens

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
on and see what happens

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.210 
on and see what happens
turn<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> water<00:04:47.880> coat<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.770> heard<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.890> relight

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
turn on the water coat I heard a relight

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.690 
turn on the water coat I heard a relight
click<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.760> we've<00:04:50.880> got<00:04:51.120> lights<00:04:51.480> here<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.700> let's

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
click and we've got lights here so let's

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.100 
click and we've got lights here so let's
go<00:04:53.820> ahead<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.090> hook<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> speaker's<00:04:54.720> up<00:04:54.900> and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
go ahead and hook the speaker's up and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.670 
go ahead and hook the speaker's up and
an<00:04:55.410> audio<00:04:55.710> source<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.400> see<00:04:56.790> what<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.030> get<00:05:00.680> when

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
an audio source and see what we get when

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.710 
an audio source and see what we get when
you<00:05:01.800> get<00:05:01.980> it<00:05:02.070> all<00:05:02.190> hooked<00:05:02.460> up<00:05:02.730> this<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.450> what<00:05:03.600> it

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
you get it all hooked up this is what it

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.490 
you get it all hooked up this is what it
sounds<00:05:04.080> like<00:05:08.570> sounds<00:05:09.570> pretty<00:05:09.960> good<00:05:12.500> bass

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
sounds like sounds pretty good bass

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:43.040 
sounds like sounds pretty good bass
controls<00:05:14.040> on<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.400> sub<00:05:14.640> word<00:05:16.190> volume

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.090 

there<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.170> go<00:05:44.380> replace<00:05:45.010> repaired<00:05:45.880> clips

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
there you go replace repaired clips

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.920 
there you go replace repaired clips
subwoofer<00:05:48.100> and<00:05:48.310> satellite<00:05:48.790> speakers<00:05:49.060> ended

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
subwoofer and satellite speakers ended

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.390 
subwoofer and satellite speakers ended
up<00:05:50.050> costing<00:05:50.320> nothing<00:05:50.920> because<00:05:51.130> I<00:05:51.250> just

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
up costing nothing because I just

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.660 
up costing nothing because I just
soldered<00:05:52.270> directly<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.900> circuit<00:05:53.230> board

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
soldered directly to the circuit board

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.630 
soldered directly to the circuit board
so<00:05:54.670> thanks<00:05:55.150> for<00:05:55.240> watching
