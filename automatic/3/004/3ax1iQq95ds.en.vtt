00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.130
 hello how are you here we are going to start a 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.050
 very nice job that we are going to do a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.109
 glove for a girl 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.470
 or child between 4 to 6 years old this is a 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.590
 glove with short fingers 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.600
 let's start here at this time already 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.340
 I have it ready but I have it open 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.860
 to explain it here we have 28 points 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.550
 in this elastic point warps and fabrics 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 with the height of 3 centimeters 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.660
 here I made the chubby little finger and we 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.660
 taken out 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.250
 together rising up to complete eight 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:11.070
 points come here I have the 28 points and 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:13.979
 here stand here come apart 12 points 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 of the 28 that I have left here because 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.490
 we have in mind that here I have 16 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.310
 points 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.640
 then after separating this finger 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 here we are going to weave three runs or two 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.160
 runs to complete up to here 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.200
 an inch and a half approximately with the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.560
 sewing will not do like a centimeter 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.900
 and a half and then we're going to start 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 weave attacking everything that was the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.390
 centimeter and a half and we can move forward 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 weave the first finger 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.210
 that here on this side of the part of 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.049
 on top of the right hand we have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.740
 4 points we take 4 points from here and 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.600
 below the glove we took 3 points and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.500
 yes we would complete 7 points 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.340
 we are going to weave from 3 to 4 runs and 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.649
 then close it and so we continue 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.560
 taking from here to three points of the part 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.750
 from below and taking four points up 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.890
 complete the seven we leave them and the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.610
 we close up here also we continue with 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.160
 the other finger we take four points and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.010
 then here we take three points and what 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.940
 we weave long that we always want 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 that are the same as the others after the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.040
 last small crime we also take 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 here the four points as we take 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.989
 the three points that would be seven if in 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.660
 The girl's house has a very thin finger 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.540
 we can remove a point and leave it in 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.750
 six on the little finger in this case what 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910
 leave the same with the 7 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.800
 so now what would be missing would be 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.800
 see it turn and sew it 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.020
 and so we have this glove so 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 beautiful for this little girl with her little fingers 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.200
 so thin 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.920
 and if you liked this work, give it a like and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.920
