00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.359
 this vote is why guys don't 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 feel free to go vote about 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.400
 of the year 2012 as a whole, it is good for 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 computer games though did not work 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 new consoles no ixbox coin no 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.040
 psn about the game came out quite serious 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.790
 cool enough and if you compare 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 2012 is the eleventh year then generally 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.880
 heaven and earth as they say well, that in 2012 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.720
 much more interesting 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 cool games came out than the same 2011 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 I would like to mention separately 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.900
 Now sounds of the game are in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.680
 I have a voting plan in my group 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.180
 better game of 2012 and these facets 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.409
 really very nice so designer 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.649
 Here is this game cool stealth action RPD 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.850
 there is all included a very interesting game I 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.500
 I think this is a good nominee for the game of the year 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 then headlights edge 3 runaway success then 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330
 there is after the unsuccessful second part of the third 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.619
 part again showed us all the charms 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.019
 this game and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 I really want to play and even 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.700
 at times let him go live there 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.680
 therefore I also include the nominee 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.680
 on the 2012 game to the max payne 3 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.930
 it really is also very good 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.579
 the game and it is no worse than the first and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.340
 the second part is generally what a cool series 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.920
 these games that they are all good there is no 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.069
 such that the second is bad 3 good 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.519
 first so so no and 1 great edge 2 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.900
 and 3 doesn't want it really is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.690
 the project is exactly the global scale and 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.120
 very cool game and i want to say that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.400
 in my opinion max payne 3 is just 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.319
 game of the year there is everything 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.109
 graphics and storyline and gameplay why are 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.829
 only worth something that worked with her 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.829
 rockstar and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.920
 it is also necessary shelling Dodona they did 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.069
 clone gta 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.900
 and did directly that max payne 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.849
 which we used to see that is all 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.819
 his charms have this whole atmosphere 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.190
 survived for this very big 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.739
 thank you rockstar and really me then 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.370
 come at least the president of the game of the year 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.870
 and in my opinion this is the game of the year 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.079
 then xcom is also a continuation of 3 too 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.599
 let's even say the games of the 90s and she 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.889
 also successful and also a good challenger 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:44.849
 on the game of the year there I turned on assassin's 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.829
 creed 3 may also be a game 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.620
 year and because the same again 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.329
 continue we see that this year 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.310
 some days of continuing the sea ​​queen and 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.230
 trillions funny stuff like that up 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.459
 eight really 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.209
 original games by and large 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.310
 Probably not all all continuation I do not 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.959
 I'll say it's bad, but it's probably one 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.269
 of feature with feature of 2012 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:13.169
 then I turned on hitman absolution again 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.940
 continuations further maybe not quite 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.070
 challenger honestly because 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.459
 low estimates now get data 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.550
 but nevertheless the game is good you know 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.560
 try to cost maybe not worth it 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.310
 Games of the year, but let it be free with this you 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.940
 for the total then the borderlands 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.150
 2 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.849
 these network thriller genes are about cooperative 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.190
 yes you can play a single game there but 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.830
 it will not bring only pleasure 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.810
 as much fun as if you it 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.219
 pass co-op neighbor with a friend 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.680
 with acquaintance that is it really 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.450
 very different things therefore I advise something else 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.729
 will not necessarily play this 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.349
 play plus play desirable 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.580
 co-op it you get much 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.729
 More fun 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.219
 Well, I included it in the list of president on 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.090
 game code 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:08.219
 diablo 3 is also such a controversial game but 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.219
 let it be possible for her 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:13.620
 vote it will be the game of the year just 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.440
 and waited a long time she came out principle 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.690
 not bad but he is not what was expected of him 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.580
 get so let it be said 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.320
 on the list but I honestly don't think on 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:31.469
 summit game of the year and euro track simulator 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.469
 2 next sequel sees all everything 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.590
 games bore circles turned out all 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:41.909
 continue or remake like but it's like 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.710
 tick so much 2012 chip here and 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.469
 euro track simulator 2 I included in this 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.990
 Why does the list seem to be okay ? 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:52.200
 type trucks where does it all such 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.490
 but it's really worth the game 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.440
 play she is very good big 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.830
 tremendous work has been done on 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.139
 compared with the first part that is well 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.380
 a lot of work was laid on me 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.659
 so I think she deserves to be 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.550
 the game of the year is a contender for the game of the year and 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.139
 if it were not for max payne most likely that I 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.680
 would choose exactly i am glad res 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:21.180
 emulator 2 so guys vote 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.610

 years and insert our put our answers 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.539

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.379
 will be no more this year 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:39.689
