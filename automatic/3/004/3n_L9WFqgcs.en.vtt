maybe<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> solid<00:00:21.359> enough<00:00:21.539> game<00:00:21.810> today<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.170> guess

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 

do<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.619> maybe<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> weather

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

do you think maybe the weather
conditions<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.079> had<00:00:34.440> anything<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.100> so

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
conditions or had anything to do with so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
itself obviously you try to use it when

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.590 
itself obviously you try to use it when
the<00:00:45.510> conditions<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.230> advantage<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the ball in play you know probably long

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.799

enough even though I wasn't hitting the
ball<00:00:54.960> poorly<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.860> been<00:00:56.010> maybe<00:00:56.940> been<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
ball poorly but it's been maybe been a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910

tough week for me the last couple and
maybe<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.030> conditions<00:01:00.320> today<00:01:01.320> didn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
maybe in these conditions today didn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.960 
help me it didn't help the calls let's
put<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.519> mean<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.760> didn't<00:01:05.939> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
put it that way but I mean I didn't have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
put it that way but I mean I didn't have
enough<00:01:06.240> chances<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:09.030> no<00:01:09.180> excuse<00:01:09.570> there

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
enough chances so it's no excuse there

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.530 
enough chances so it's no excuse there
and<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.470> tried<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.119> didn't<00:01:12.299> work<00:01:12.330> out

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and I tried and it just didn't work out

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
and I tried and it just didn't work out
today<00:01:14.270> Roger<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:16.890> many<00:01:17.130> chances<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
today Roger you had many chances in the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.620 
today Roger you had many chances in the
second<00:01:18.720> set<00:01:18.960> three<00:01:19.470> love<00:01:19.710> four<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> five<00:01:21.240> four

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
second set three love four to five four

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499 
second set three love four to five four
and<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.530> crowd<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> also<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and the crowd was with you also do you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
and the crowd was with you also do you
think<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.799> said<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think that if you had one that said it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.440 
think that if you had one that said it
would<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.729> been<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> totally<00:01:27.420> different

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
would have been a totally different

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
would have been a totally different
match<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.560> yes<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.729> have

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
match or not yes I think it would have

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
match or not yes I think it would have
been<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.189> not<00:01:34.820> where<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.030> talked<00:01:36.270> about

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
been but it's not where you talked about

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
been but it's not where you talked about
struggling<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.990> find<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.350> rhythm<00:01:37.530> after<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
struggling to find your rhythm after a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
struggling to find your rhythm after a
few<00:01:38.939> matches<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.450> week<00:01:39.659> did<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> feel<00:01:40.170> any

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
few matches this week did you feel any

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
few matches this week did you feel any
any<00:01:40.650> better<00:01:40.920> today<00:01:41.130> did<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> were

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
any better today did you think you were

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.380 
any better today did you think you were
hitting<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> ball<00:01:42.270> any<00:01:42.420> better<00:01:44.090> maybe<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
hitting the ball any better maybe you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.340 
hitting the ball any better maybe you
know<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.540> mean<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> guess<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.200> more

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
know I mean I guess it was more

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.719 
know I mean I guess it was more
straightforward<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.130> obviously<00:01:47.490> no

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
straightforward because obviously no

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
straightforward because obviously no
like<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.509> forces<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> issue<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.500> well

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like you know forces the issue as well

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
like you know forces the issue as well
so<00:01:49.920> there's<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.810> there's<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.960> more<00:01:52.140> reacting

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so there's not there's bit more reacting

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.170 
so there's not there's bit more reacting
you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> next<00:01:53.939> you're<00:01:54.149> just

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you know going on the next you're just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.639 
you know going on the next you're just
being<00:01:54.570> able<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> decide<00:01:55.170> where<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
being able to decide where you want to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.910 
being able to decide where you want to
hit<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> ball<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:57.240> many<00:01:57.390> different<00:01:57.920> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hit the ball and how many different you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.660 
hit the ball and how many different you
know<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.369> many<00:01:59.549> different

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
know was how many different

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
know was how many different
possibilities<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.600> hit<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
possibilities can you hit it in a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
possibilities can you hit it in a
certain<00:02:01.409> corner<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.610> think<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
certain corner that was I think a bit of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
certain corner that was I think a bit of
my<00:02:03.360> issue<00:02:03.540> early<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> week<00:02:04.969> obviously

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
my issue early on in the week obviously

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.990 
my issue early on in the week obviously
against<00:02:06.630> top<00:02:07.049> players<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:08.000> more

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
against top players it's more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
against top players it's more
straightforward<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:10.319> doing<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
straightforward you know you're doing a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.580 
straightforward you know you're doing a
bit<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:10.890> reacting<00:02:11.520> as<00:02:11.640> well<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
bit more reacting as well and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.300 
bit more reacting as well and
that<00:02:13.280> was<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.490> case<00:02:13.840> out<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.200> today<00:02:15.890> as<00:02:16.130> well

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that was the case out here today as well

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
that was the case out here today as well
I<00:02:16.670> thought<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.270> know<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.600> was<00:02:17.900> playing<00:02:18.170> very

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I thought you know I was playing very

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
I thought you know I was playing very
aggressive<00:02:19.010> early<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.090> had<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> break<00:02:20.690> things

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
aggressive early on had the break things

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.540 
aggressive early on had the break things
were<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.440> well<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:21.860> obviously<00:02:21.980> was<00:02:22.370> always

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
were going well but obviously was always

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.700 
were going well but obviously was always
going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.760> be<00:02:22.820> hard<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.300> keep<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.720> know<00:02:23.840> I'm

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
going to be hard to keep you know I'm

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.220 
going to be hard to keep you know I'm
serving<00:02:25.070> well<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> wind<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.230> obviously

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
serving well in the wind and obviously

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.170 
serving well in the wind and obviously
when<00:02:27.380> Novak's<00:02:28.070> up<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.370> good<00:02:28.490> returns<00:02:28.880> you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
when Novak's up some good returns you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.790 
when Novak's up some good returns you
know<00:02:29.210> my<00:02:29.480> first<00:02:29.660> service<00:02:30.110> obviously<00:02:30.350> was

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
know my first service obviously was

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.280 
know my first service obviously was
going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.070> difficult<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.170> was<00:02:33.170> actually

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
going to be difficult but I was actually

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.590 
going to be difficult but I was actually
feeling<00:02:33.790> particularly<00:02:34.790> well<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.240> second

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
feeling particularly well in the second

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.810 
feeling particularly well in the second
set<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:36.500> obviously<00:02:37.370> hurts<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> most

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
set so that one obviously hurts the most

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.390 
set so that one obviously hurts the most
to<00:02:38.060> lose

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
to lose

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.070 
to lose
yeah<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> first<00:02:41.090> set<00:02:41.300> too<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
yeah on the first set too but in the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.490 
yeah on the first set too but in the
third<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:43.190> mean<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.940> don't<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.570> just<00:02:44.720> wasn't<00:02:45.350> able

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
third I mean I don't I just wasn't able

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.530 
third I mean I don't I just wasn't able
to<00:02:45.740> put<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.220> good<00:02:46.490> game<00:02:46.640> together<00:02:46.850> anymore<00:02:47.300> on

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
to put a good game together anymore on

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.930 
to put a good game together anymore on
the<00:02:47.630> return<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.230> particular<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.980> obviously

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the return in particular and obviously

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.460 
the return in particular and obviously
was<00:02:50.090> two<00:02:50.420> sets<00:02:50.630> from<00:02:50.720> love<00:02:50.870> leading<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.320> snow

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
buckets it's not the same match anymore

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.080
