00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.220 

from<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.530> very<00:00:01.620> beginning<00:00:02.300> the<00:00:03.300> ipad<00:00:04.049> was

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
from the very beginning the ipad was

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.410 
from the very beginning the ipad was
designed<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.920> be<00:00:05.130> very<00:00:05.160> powerful<00:00:05.850> very

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.640 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:07.309> but<00:00:08.309> also<00:00:09.019> remarkably<00:00:10.019> simple<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.440 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.650> our<00:00:13.799> goal<00:00:14.130> was<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.940> take<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
use so our goal was to take all the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.599 
use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:15.839> things<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:18.060> iPad<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.109> pack<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.619> into<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.390 
full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.090> much<00:00:21.359> smaller<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.310 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.760> did<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> new<00:00:24.930> iPad

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that's what we did with the new iPad

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460 
that's what we did with the new iPad
Mini<00:00:26.480> one<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> things<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.930> makes<00:00:28.109> iPad

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
Mini one of the things that makes iPad

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919 
Mini one of the things that makes iPad
so<00:00:28.740> incredible<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.789> there's<00:00:30.449> almost<00:00:30.630> no

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so incredible is that there's almost no

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.560 
so incredible is that there's almost no
end<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> when

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
end to what you can do with it so when

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
end to what you can do with it so when
we<00:00:33.690> decided<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> ipad<00:00:34.680> mini<00:00:34.710> we

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
features that make iPad so magical he

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
features that make iPad so magical he
began<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> display<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> same

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
began with a display that has the same

began with a display that has the same
resolution<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.020> ipad<00:00:43.410> 2<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.360> your

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
resolution as the ipad 2 so all your

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840

small enough to fit in one hand but it's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
small enough to fit in one hand but it's
still<00:00:53.520> large<00:00:53.789> enough<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.270> give<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.809> rich

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.460 

before<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.329> we<00:01:37.450> had<00:01:37.540> done<00:01:37.810> was<00:01:38.049> take<00:01:38.290> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
before that we had done was take the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.460 
before that we had done was take the
original<00:01:38.920> iPad<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.549> just<00:01:39.790> reduce<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.470> all

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
original iPad and just reduce it all

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.340 
original iPad and just reduce it all
that<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.890> would<00:01:42.040> be<00:01:42.159> aware<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:43.689> was

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
that you would be aware of was was

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.749 
that you would be aware of was was
everything<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.920> was<00:01:45.009> just<00:01:45.220> missing<00:01:45.430> that

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
everything that was just missing that

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.649 
everything that was just missing that
there<00:01:46.299> is<00:01:46.450> inherent<00:01:46.689> loss<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:48.159> just<00:01:48.759> reducing

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
there is inherent loss in just reducing

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.550 
there is inherent loss in just reducing
a<00:01:49.750> product<00:01:50.110> inside<00:01:50.789> on<00:01:51.789> what<00:01:52.060> we<00:01:52.270> did<00:01:52.659> was<00:01:53.530> we

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
a product inside on what we did was we

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.200 
a product inside on what we did was we
went<00:01:53.799> back<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.159> very<00:01:54.280> beginning<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:54.970> we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
went back to the very beginning and we

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.690 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.659> time<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.619> design<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.009> product<00:01:57.429> that

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
took the time to design a product that

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.749 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.259> concentration<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.380> not<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.039> reduction

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.410 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.880> original<00:02:02.220> we<00:02:03.220> felt<00:02:03.490> strongly<00:02:03.909> that

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.469 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:05.229> point<00:02:05.500> nine<00:02:05.560> inches<00:02:06.130> was<00:02:06.820> exactly<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.469 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:07.689> display<00:02:08.140> size<00:02:08.549> but<00:02:09.549> it<00:02:09.670> became<00:02:10.000> clear

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.050 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:11.350> had<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.680> reduce<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:12.190> width<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.819> the
