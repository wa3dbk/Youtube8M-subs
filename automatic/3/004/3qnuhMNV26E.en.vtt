00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
Store and I think they don't even have

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.030 
Store and I think they don't even have
I'm<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.700> sure<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.349> base<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I'm not sure and and don't base it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.369 
I'm not sure and and don't base it
for<00:02:14.219> what<00:02:14.969> I'm<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.209> say<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.420> now<00:02:15.569> but<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
for what I'm gonna say right now but I

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.910 
for what I'm gonna say right now but I
don't<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:16.739> they've<00:02:16.890> gotten<00:02:17.129> 100<00:02:17.670> cells<00:02:17.909> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
don't think they've gotten 100 cells and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.589 
don't think they've gotten 100 cells and
