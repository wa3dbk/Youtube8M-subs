team<00:00:09.809> litter<00:00:10.200> bug<00:00:10.440> gameplay<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> premised

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
team litter bug gameplay the premised

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.980 
team litter bug gameplay the premised
first<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.730> quite<00:00:12.059> interesting<00:00:12.599> I've<00:00:12.750> done<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
first one quite interesting I've done it

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600 
first one quite interesting I've done it
before<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.410> other<00:00:13.530> call<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.799> duty's<00:00:14.160> but

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
before on the other call of duty's but

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.070 
before on the other call of duty's but
basically<00:00:14.940> when<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.360> kill<00:00:15.540> someone<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> have

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
basically when you kill someone you have

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260 
basically when you kill someone you have
to<00:00:16.109> pick<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.440> their<00:00:16.590> gun<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.789> carry<00:00:18.180> on

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
to pick up their gun and then carry on

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.910 
to pick up their gun and then carry on
like<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.050> killed<00:00:19.439> him<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.710> pick<00:00:19.830> up

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
like so so you killed him and pick up

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
like so so you killed him and pick up
that<00:00:20.010> gun<00:00:20.070> kill<00:00:20.490> someone<00:00:20.730> else<00:00:20.880> pick<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.180> their

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
that gun kill someone else pick up their

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
that gun kill someone else pick up their
gun<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.900> carry<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:22.949> were<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
gun and carry on like so there were a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
gun and carry on like so there were a
couple<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.490> occasions<00:00:23.670> where<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> killed

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
couple of occasions where I killed

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.300 
couple of occasions where I killed
someone<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.199> their<00:00:25.350> own<00:00:25.500> gun<00:00:25.769> straight<00:00:26.070> away

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
someone with their own gun straight away

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.529 
someone with their own gun straight away
so<00:00:26.369> obviously<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.849> couldn't<00:00:26.939> pick<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> gun

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so obviously I couldn't pick up the gun

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029 
so obviously I couldn't pick up the gun
i<00:00:27.570> picked<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> ammo<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.500> carried<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
i picked up the ammo and carried on to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
i picked up the ammo and carried on to
anyway<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> gameplay<00:00:30.179> i<00:00:30.330> hope<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
anyway that's the gameplay i hope you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.110 
anyway that's the gameplay i hope you
enjoy<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> bit<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> mad<00:00:32.850> rush

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
enjoy that this was a bit of a mad rush

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
enjoy that this was a bit of a mad rush
at<00:00:33.390> least<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.649> anyway<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
at least start right here but anyway the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.270 
at least start right here but anyway the
topic<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.820> i've<00:00:36.030> been<00:00:36.059> looking<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.280> 3d

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
topic so i've been looking into 3d

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
topic so i've been looking into 3d
printing<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.960> found<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.320> really

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
printing and i found some really

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
printing and i found some really
interesting<00:00:40.829> stuff<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.579> i<00:00:41.760> thought<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.000> be

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
interesting stuff and i thought would be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
interesting stuff and i thought would be
a<00:00:42.149> cool<00:00:42.510> commentary<00:00:42.989> topic<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.680> i'd<00:00:43.770> share

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
a cool commentary topic and i'd share

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.920 
a cool commentary topic and i'd share
what<00:00:44.190> i've<00:00:44.309> learnt<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.000> guys<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> get

your insight on it and that kind of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
your insight on it and that kind of
stuff<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.030> i'm<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.480> straight<00:00:48.780> into

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
stuff so i'm going to go straight into

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.310 
stuff so i'm going to go straight into
it<00:00:49.579> okay<00:00:50.579> first<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> 3d<00:00:51.960> printing

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it okay first of all what is 3d printing

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
it okay first of all what is 3d printing
3d<00:00:52.530> printing<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> quite<00:00:53.610> simply<00:00:54.000> printing

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
3d printing is quite simply printing

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.020 
3d printing is quite simply printing
objects<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> three<00:00:56.100> dimensions<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.879> like

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
objects in three dimensions just like

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.779 
objects in three dimensions just like
you<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> might<00:00:57.600> print<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> 2d<00:00:58.739> image<00:00:59.399> onto<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you or I might print a 2d image onto a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
you or I might print a 2d image onto a
piece<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> paper<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> third<00:01:01.079> dimension

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
piece of paper with the third dimension

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
piece of paper with the third dimension
going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> start<00:01:01.920> using<00:01:02.039> materials<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
going to start using materials and it's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to start using materials and it's
going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> rise<00:01:03.570> off<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> paper<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going to rise off the paper or so to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.760 
going to rise off the paper or so to
speak<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> create<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.360> actual<00:01:06.689> solid<00:01:07.020> object

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
speak and create an actual solid object

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.550 
speak and create an actual solid object
which<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.430> know<00:01:08.460> leads<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> crazy

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
which is you know leads so crazy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
which is you know leads so crazy
potential<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.860> basically<00:01:11.400> you'd<00:01:11.970> use

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
potential and basically you'd use

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.750 
potential and basically you'd use
computer<00:01:12.659> aided<00:01:12.720> design<00:01:12.930> CAD<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.640> know

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
computer aided design CAD to you know

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.100 
computer aided design CAD to you know
put<00:01:14.970> together<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
put together what you actually want to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
put together what you actually want to
create<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.250> choose<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> material<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
create and you choose the material the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
create and you choose the material the
machine<00:01:18.630> instead<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> having<00:01:19.200> incan<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> would

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
machine instead of having incan it would

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.679 
machine instead of having incan it would
have<00:01:19.979> materials<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.420> would<00:01:21.509> start

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
have materials and it would start

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
have materials and it would start
putting<00:01:21.990> together<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.560> object<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
putting together this object for you and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
putting together this object for you and
you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> really

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you know it's going to really

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.039 
you know it's going to really
revolutionize<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.850> way<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.720> things

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
revolutionize the way you know things

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.499 
revolutionize the way you know things
work<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.590> mean<00:01:28.970> people<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.299> gonna<00:01:30.450> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
work I mean people are just gonna be

piece of equipment you know an appliance
and<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> made<00:01:38.400> rather<00:01:38.729> than<00:01:38.880> going

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and just have it made rather than going

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
and just have it made rather than going
out<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> store<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.810> buy<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:41.340> just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
out to store to buy it and it's just

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
out to store to buy it and it's just
going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> change<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.899> work<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
going to change the way things work you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.660 
going to change the way things work you
know<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> getting<00:01:43.920> developed<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.549> it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know this is getting developed and it's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
know this is getting developed and it's
probably<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> reality

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
probably going to be you know a reality

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
probably going to be you know a reality
in<00:01:46.740> 20<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.030> years<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.509> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
in 20 or so years and I think it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
in 20 or so years and I think it's
actually<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
actually going to be one of you know the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
actually going to be one of you know the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
biggest revolutions are one of the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.760 
biggest revolutions are one of the
