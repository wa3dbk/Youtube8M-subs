00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all and nine I hope you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.600
 go well today I find you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.849
 for a video trailer uac shon on the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 new trailer of fifty shape of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.929
 prey so I had not expected at all 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.130
 do this video basically since I 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.450
 had already done 1 for the first 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
 trailer I got myself I did not do it at 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 whenever there is a new but 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.789
 you have been a few to ask me 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 if I was going to make this video and if 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 I had not planned to do it because 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.920
 I could plan to do it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 passed very French that I said 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.250
 finally brief blow I told myself 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.470
 why not just be what it always 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.940
 nice except that it was a little bit 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.829
 immersed in extreme frustration 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.809
 since the trailer has been released since 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 a few days already and that I do not have 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.309
 could do my video before and it would have 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 very well could have happened i mean but 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 I do not know everyone decided to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 talk about this trailer is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 just not possible everyone has 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 spoken as well on facebook it's 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
 placarded on all the walls on twitter 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.510
 only on youtube 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 I always had lots of suggestions 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.289
 youtube on on what to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 finally the frustration comes to his 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 term what I will finally be able to see 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.609

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.609

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.060
 already visually I find that it's 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.820
 always so good and then I saw 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.820
 really good like that to the greek 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.869

 [Music] 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.560
 Yes 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 c 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 it was said is true ah no and too 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.460
 well finally the trailer is too 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.850
 good and I feel like the movie is going 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.310
 to be too good too what then how 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.290
 to say frankly down I had loved the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.370
 first trailer and I love the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.890
 second round yesterday a little bit ago 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.600
 the same passages that come back but 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.540
 but in fact I am a little comforted 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.880
 in a sense where I'm going to spend a little 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.920
 little for a bit of a shameless 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.840
 but hey it does not matter we see he 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.970
 are there any scenes that are 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.530
 times and I find that sticks 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.720
 rather well we deliver without 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.280
 that it does vulgar actually I find 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.350
 that visually it goes very very well 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.580
 his hunger eat I do not have that stuff 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.040
 shocking and it was even pretty nice ccg 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.600
 not all everything is very very beautiful 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.070
 in this trailer and I'm 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.440
 really confident so much done for the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.150
 movie now while I was full 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.380
 of a priori at the beginning when I learned 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.850
 that it will be adapted to the cinema 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.030
 but in fact no I think it can 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.140
 give something rather nice and 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.220
 the songs they did well at last 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.180
 in any case that's what I see in the 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.230
 trailer because I have a little 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.790
 feeling like you're already 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.140
 criticized the film but what I have to 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.480
 the trailer sure they did a 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.730
 without wanting to give a good balance to 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.870
 history not just sex since of 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.940
 anyway it would not happen at 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.500
 cinema like that but without so much 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.750
 that it went completely to 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.460
 second plan since it is necessary not to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.890
 to deceive the basis of this story is 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.250
 sex 1 this is not a book 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.750
 erotic for nothing and it's 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.890
 sex a bit peculiar 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.110
 a little sadomasochistic 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.700
 and it's true that they have not really 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.890
 actually tried to soften the thing in 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.690
 the film they still brought it 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.540
 but so that it is when 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.770
 same beautiful here besides I say not 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.240
 that it's not beautiful in real life I 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.890
 do not know but I find that the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.930
 visually that does not make it vulgar 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.790
 that's it's more important I had 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.920
 really scared that if he adapted in 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.639
 pushing too far this kind of scene the 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.400
 phase view 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.139
 and that it distorts the beauty of the book and 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.610
 not at all and I 'm happy 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.590
 also that here it is not decided 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.539
 to completely ignore these 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.870
 scenes from completely delete them 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.599
 and still given importance 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.490
 primordial actually it's this one 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.099
 since this is a little what will 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.039
 bring these two characters to merge 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.860
 and having plenty is not something 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.939
 here's a say things like that no 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.009
 honestly I find that these 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.539
 workers is very very beautiful game 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.430
 consciousness that I said in first 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.069
 trailer reactions on 50 million 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.930
 degrees the colorimetry of the image 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.879
 perfectly matches the idea 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.580
 that I was doing from the universe of the book 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.949
 it's pretty cold that's if they do that 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.849
 it's very luxurious finally it sticks 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.430
 perfectly to the story 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.840
 taylor that we see in this band 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.699
 announces I find that matches but 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.279
 very well to the idea that I 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.819
 was doing taylor here I find that 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.979
 verizon well chosen and I'm always 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.289
 also convinced in fact of anastasia and 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.449
 of and of christian by cons I have to 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.279
 you admit that in this trailer we 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.289
 hear christian who speaks a little bit 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.370
 longer and I was a little 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.680
 little confused I find that the avs to the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.849
 boad christian and I do not know I 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.860
 did not expect it to be so 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.330
 serious actually 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.490
 then you will say yes but he has a 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.259
 little talked about in the first trailer that you 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.219
 have watched you said yes but here I have 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.569
 not having heard him speak 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.069
 longer I have more confidence 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.430
 in fact the fact that his voice is very 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.469
 serious 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.550
 wow it's nothing very disturbing but 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.139
 it's true that it made me a little 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.849
 weird then by cons I've never 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.259
 listened trailer nice 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.879
 the atmosphere degrees in French I know 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.669
 not what it gives but in any case 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.360
 here is the voice of jamie dornan I believe 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:42.000
 that that's it his name is serious enough 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.800
 but it does not remove absolutely at all 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.899
 its charm i want to specify ebadi 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.120
 who listened to it there is nothing more 

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.439
 to say anyhow sorters 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.000
 the aktion is still pretty short 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.770
 because shit not too much either 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.259
 criticize with band'annonce 1 it's 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.580
 difficult we will say in any case if you 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.660
 enjoyed this trailer or 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.070
 instead you said 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.630
 do not hesitate to let me know 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.980
 comment and has developed a little bit 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.260
 your opinion it's always interesting 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.790
 here is to be able to exchange anyway 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.990
