same sensor as intake 6 4 5 D and the
Mamiya<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> couple<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.590> coming

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
Mamiya there's a couple of them coming

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
Mamiya there's a couple of them coming
out<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.309> bad<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.140> know

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
out a so bad also have one but you know

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
out a so bad also have one but you know
sensors<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.430> used<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> different

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
sensors get used in a lot of different

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
sensors get used in a lot of different
cameras<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.079> always<00:00:58.260> been<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> case<00:00:58.920> it's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
cameras that's always been the case it's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
cameras that's always been the case it's
how<00:00:59.730> they're<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.120> implemented<00:01:00.930> by<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
how they're actually implemented by the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.660 
how they're actually implemented by the
different<00:01:01.469> companies<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> software<00:01:02.520> they

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
different companies in the software they

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
different companies in the software they
wrap<00:01:02.879> around<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> whole

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
wrap around them and how the whole

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
wrap around them and how the whole
engineering<00:01:04.530> package<00:01:05.040> comes<00:01:05.309> together<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
engineering package comes together that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
engineering package comes together that
determines<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> final<00:01:07.170> image<00:01:07.710> quality<00:01:07.979> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
determines the final image quality so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.830 
determines the final image quality so
today<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> few

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
today I just want to take a few

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
today I just want to take a few
different<00:01:10.170> sample<00:01:10.500> images<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.310> and

this<00:01:28.560> guy<00:01:28.770> goes<00:01:28.979> natively<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> 3200<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this guy goes natively up to 3200 so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.590 
this guy goes natively up to 3200 so
we'll<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.079> ISO<00:01:31.439> comparison<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.189> well

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
we'll do an ISO comparison as well

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
we'll do an ISO comparison as well
taking<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> close<00:01:33.869> look<00:01:34.079> around<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> bodies<00:01:34.799> of

taking a close look around the bodies of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
taking a close look around the bodies of
these<00:01:35.100> two<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
these two it's just the back that's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090 
these two it's just the back that's
different<00:01:37.020> they're<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> same<00:01:37.680> body<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
different they're on the same body and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.249 
different they're on the same body and
they<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> same<00:01:38.670> lens<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> it's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
they have the same lens on them and it's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
they have the same lens on them and it's
the<00:01:40.439> back<00:01:40.590> where<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> magic<00:01:41.189> happens

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the back where all the magic happens

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.069 
the back where all the magic happens
that's<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:42.630> looking<00:01:42.780> at

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that's what you're really looking at

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.660 
that's what you're really looking at
here<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> single<00:01:44.009> compact<00:01:44.460> flash

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
here they have a single compact flash

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
here they have a single compact flash
card<00:01:45.030> built<00:01:45.270> into<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.799> sensors<00:01:47.189> are

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
card built into them but the sensors are

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.289 
card built into them but the sensors are
vastly<00:01:47.640> different

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
vastly different

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.469 
vastly different
so<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> iq250<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> actual

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so this is the iq250 that's the actual

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
so this is the iq250 that's the actual
sensor<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:52.619> spending<00:01:52.799> all

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
sensor that's what you're spending all

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
sensor that's what you're spending all
the<00:01:53.189> money<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:54.119> around<00:01:54.329> 70<00:01:54.810> percent

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the money on that's around 70 percent

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
the money on that's around 70 percent
bigger<00:01:55.320> than<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> 35

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
bigger than a 35

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550 
bigger than a 35
millimeter<00:01:56.730> full-frame<00:01:57.210> sensor<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.440> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
millimeter full-frame sensor and this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.850 
millimeter full-frame sensor and this
one<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> 280<00:02:00.330> that's<00:02:00.660> another<00:02:01.020> 60%

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
one is from the 280 that's another 60%

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.160 
one is from the 280 that's another 60%
bigger<00:02:02.040> again<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.910> that's<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> CMOS

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
bigger again and that's the CMOS

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
bigger again and that's the CMOS
technology<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.860> seems<00:02:05.100> new<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.910> see<00:02:06.060> like

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
technology it seems new you can see like

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
technology it seems new you can see like
some<00:02:06.510> kind<00:02:06.870> of<00:02:06.930> grid<00:02:07.320> inside<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.100> could<00:02:08.460> be

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
some kind of grid inside that could be

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.730 
some kind of grid inside that could be
just<00:02:09.270> an<00:02:09.390> optical<00:02:09.570> illusion<00:02:09.960> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.590> see

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
just an optical illusion and you can see

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.440 
just an optical illusion and you can see
there<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.100> noticeable<00:02:11.550> difference<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.180> size

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
there is a noticeable difference in size

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.840 
there is a noticeable difference in size
between<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.140> two<00:02:13.320> looking<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> CMOS<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
between the two looking at the CMOS I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.160 
between the two looking at the CMOS I
hope<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.180> comes<00:02:15.360> through<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.870> video

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hope this comes through in the video

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.949 
hope this comes through in the video
it's<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.800> single<00:02:17.340> panel<00:02:17.720> whereas<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> look

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
it's a single panel whereas if you look

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.800 
it's a single panel whereas if you look
at<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> CCD<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.570> there

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
at the CCD one you can kind of see there

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.460 
at the CCD one you can kind of see there
there's<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.290> eight<00:02:22.620> panels<00:02:24.320> individual<00:02:25.320> one

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
there's like eight panels individual one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.840 
there's like eight panels individual one
is<00:02:25.620> little<00:02:25.800> being<00:02:26.010> stitched<00:02:26.280> together<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
is little being stitched together and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.000 
is little being stitched together and
then<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.540> calibrated<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.890> can

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
then all have to be calibrated you can

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
then all have to be calibrated you can

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.630 
guy so you are looking at buying the
body<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.750> well<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.430> obviously<00:02:38.430> whatever

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
body as well and obviously whatever

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.340 
body as well and obviously whatever
lenses<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.239> want<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.080> clicks

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
lenses you want and then the back clicks

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.199 
lenses you want and then the back clicks
straight<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.520> starting<00:02:42.120> off

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
straight on to there so starting off

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.449 
straight on to there so starting off
with<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> IQ<00:02:42.630> 280<00:02:43.380> that's<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:44.070> its<00:02:44.250> highest

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
with the IQ 280 that's at its highest

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.000 
with the IQ 280 that's at its highest
native<00:02:44.970> ISO<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.510> 800<00:02:46.170> they<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> mode<00:02:46.830> we

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
native ISO of 800 they have a mode we

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
native ISO of 800 they have a mode we
can<00:02:47.190> drop<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.520> resolution<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> quarter<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
can drop the resolution to a quarter and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
can drop the resolution to a quarter and
boost<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.380> up<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> at<00:02:50.310> 3200<00:02:51.300> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
boost it up so this is it at 3200 and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.900 
boost it up so this is it at 3200 and
that's<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.810> crop<00:02:52.050> much<00:02:52.290> lower<00:02:52.590> res<00:02:52.950> checking

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that's the crop much lower res checking

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's the crop much lower res checking
out<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> 250<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> 50<00:02:55.470> megapixel<00:02:56.070> CMOS

hundred<00:02:57.870> ISO<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:59.340> certainly<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.880> lot<00:03:00.180> cleaner

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

they're<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.019> 400<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.610> floor<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.060> so

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
they're at 400 but on the floor it's so

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.210 
they're at 400 but on the floor it's so

year warranty plan and the 115 is just a
1<00:04:44.460> year<00:04:44.700> but<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.510> think<00:04:45.690> if<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.200> gonna<00:04:46.349> be

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
1 year but I think if I was gonna be

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.760 
1 year but I think if I was gonna be
dropping<00:04:46.919> playing<00:04:47.460> 25<00:04:48.110> 30,000<00:04:49.110> euro<00:04:49.349> on<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
dropping playing 25 30,000 euro on the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.670 
dropping playing 25 30,000 euro on the
back<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:50.220> 40<00:04:50.820> 50<00:04:51.120> thousand<00:04:51.599> on<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.720> system<00:04:52.200> I'd

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
back so 40 50 thousand on a system I'd

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.110 
back so 40 50 thousand on a system I'd
probably<00:04:52.919> want<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.310> 5<00:04:53.490> year<00:04:53.700> warranty<00:04:53.849> now

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120
