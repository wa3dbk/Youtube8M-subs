00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.400
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.769
 let's play call of duty advance warfare 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 Unfortunately, there is currently only one 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.460
 round of cod since I currently that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.940
 problem has that my pc smears 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 always about an hour later 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.960
 Nevertheless, I think that the show 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.530
 must continue to go so blatantly or 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.590
 no full show stripped down version of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.970
 call of duty 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.759
 Thanks a lot for your understanding of mine 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.009
 ladies and gentlemen as well as much with the ak 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.640
 12 probably the skos one anyway 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.920
 packed we will see I have for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.850
 terrace waiting times look instinct 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 it has become 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:35.360
 instinct stinks but hey hey hey we 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.360
 have to go through there 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.310
 I fucked up shit I think 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.500
 i am ill or i will be back 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 sick but i am extra of mine 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030
 body is just tired 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:14.070
 I am also on the way with the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 Ak 12 won very nice, too 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:22.350
 somewhere else will be happy even on 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 what the fuck is right at the same time 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.459
 The shit is the same 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 either break down or if someone 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.709
 that's supposed to be different 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.030
 not like a corpse there you feel 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.420
 like a step when you look at the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.870
 same shoots full hit funds 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.870
 important 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.810
 ekkehard the fight ever said 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.599
 that this card does not grab too 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.670
 if we sometimes have very cool kills 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.879
 tear 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.879
 if I already 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.330
 few of them got it 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.020
 striker 33 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.640
 I think I have a fever normally 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.570
 alone are correct in gambling 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.570
 now they were full 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:40.370
 that's why the penner rom is a penner 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:46.459
 around that jumped high was great 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.350
 says face like seven are leading here 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.950
 there are many on the map 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.950
 fight 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.580
 the real shit 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:13.170
 oh yes that was just in one 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:23.260
 I'll be there exactly 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:26.490
 We are lucky for us from somewhere 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.750
 no matter how special crate 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.280
 probably no one bullshit 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.280
 but needs already after without 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:45.599
 everything is good double out here 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.430
 damn damn damn from behind 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:58.240
 that was why damn well 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:05.620
 was the right place at the esl place 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.720
 One would be i hate this panel my 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.940
 advantage the know it becomes more one 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.180
 come here and then do them 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.419
 due they really fight consciously 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.199
 somewhere and all so far I have 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.199
 nothing is going against it 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.229
 the places have to let the too high 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.229
 So patch 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.250
 as long as someone steals in keel does that 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:03.440
 Of course I'm sorry but hey that must 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.880
 be times coming back here should 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.320
 no one has no friends but 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.850
 Nevertheless, the camper speaks already 11 9 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.180
 yes, I can not believe anything anymore 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.180
 tear 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.570
 I think the bomb is behind us 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:39.120
 Delivered from there, that's it 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.950
 not the pedelec if he always just rum 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.990
 and not just a form of 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.100
 that got 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.090
 it's the mac's none at all 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.860
 chance no matter this round is a mess 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.340
 Round was probably nothing running opponents 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.170
 easy 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:07:05.130
 the majority of the opponents always tomorrow 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:07:08.610
 So you know that's the big one 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.870
 wanker of course he gets again and again 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.910
 support but now have one 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.460
 chance to get him but not already 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:22.890
 got 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:25.190
 No matter we are here anyway 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.190
 none 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.729
 always if you try too 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:43.039
 opponents are then no paladin comes 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:47.419
 we all go downstairs now but so 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:55.460
 that must be how you see we get 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:57.110
 us not where we where where we completely 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:06.620
 had made a run of the 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:06.979
 opponent no we only had none here 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.629
 idea 

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:11.240
 No matter the water for today many thanks 

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:15.069
 to watch as they join us tomorrow 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.069
 call of duty every day nice day yet
