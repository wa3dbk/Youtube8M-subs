00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's just a little bit small and the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's just a little bit small and the
shoots<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.940> starting<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> thicken<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.809> as

now as the air temperatures warm up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
now as the air temperatures warm up
you'll<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.920> able<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> harvest<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.670> asparagus

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you'll be able to harvest your asparagus

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
you'll be able to harvest your asparagus
every<00:01:03.420> day<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> you'll<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> keep<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
every day and you'll want to keep on it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.399 
every day and you'll want to keep on it
so<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> plants<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.000> too<00:01:06.240> big<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so that the plants don't get too big we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
so that the plants don't get too big we
want<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> harvest<00:01:07.830> shoots<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.810> between

want to harvest shoots that are between
7<00:01:10.320> &amp;<00:01:10.470> 9<00:01:10.500> inches<00:01:11.240> tall<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
7 &amp; 9 inches tall and so this is a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.399 
7 &amp; 9 inches tall and so this is a
really<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.650> size<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.610> harvest<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.229> could

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
really good size to harvest so we could

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.399 
really good size to harvest so we could
tell<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> quality<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.299> asparagus<00:01:18.750> by

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tell the quality of the asparagus by

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.190 
tell the quality of the asparagus by
looking<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> shoot<00:01:20.220> -<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.689> best<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
looking at the shoot - it's best to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.460 
looking at the shoot - it's best to
harvest<00:01:22.710> asparagus<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> morning<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.950 
to harvest for about two to three weeks
and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> second<00:01:54.540> year<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and then in the second year you can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.670 
and then in the second year you can
increase<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:56.189> four<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:57.270> six<00:01:57.600> weeks<00:01:57.869> now

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
increase that to four to six weeks now

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
increase that to four to six weeks now
when<00:01:58.829> you're<00:01:58.950> harvesting<00:01:59.189> asparagus<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.630> if

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
when you're harvesting asparagus even if

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.660 
when you're harvesting asparagus even if
they're<00:02:00.990> overgrown<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.369> want<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they're overgrown like this you want to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.050 
they're overgrown like this you want to
remove<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.960> allow<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.280> asparagus<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
remove it to allow the asparagus to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.999 
remove it to allow the asparagus to
continue<00:02:06.540> producing

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
a good rule of thumb is to end harvest

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.500 
a good rule of thumb is to end harvest

from<00:02:26.709> your<00:02:27.099> asparagus<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.970> they'll<00:02:28.269> begin<00:02:28.390> to

from your asparagus and they'll begin to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.050 
from your asparagus and they'll begin to

and<00:02:42.340> an<00:02:42.430> old<00:02:42.640> practice<00:02:43.299> was<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.959> put<00:02:44.170> salt

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and an old practice was to put salt

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.250 
and an old practice was to put salt
around<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.700> plants<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.450> manage<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.019> weeds

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
around the plants to manage the weeds

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.610 
around the plants to manage the weeds
and<00:02:47.620> while<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.579> salt<00:02:49.090> does<00:02:49.329> not<00:02:49.569> harm<00:02:50.049> asparagus

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and while a salt does not harm asparagus

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.670 
and while a salt does not harm asparagus
it's<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> recommended<00:02:52.120> practice

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
it's not really a recommended practice

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's not really a recommended practice
because<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.579> salt<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.180> other<00:02:55.329> cause

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
because the salt can do other cause

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.229 
because the salt can do other cause
other<00:02:56.019> problems<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:57.370> interfere<00:02:58.180> with

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
other problems it can interfere with

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.170 
other problems it can interfere with

water movement through the soil and rain

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.270 
water movement through the soil and rain
and<00:03:01.420> irrigation<00:03:01.510> water<00:03:02.079> can<00:03:02.410> leach<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.920> salt

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
and irrigation water can leach that salt

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.030 
and irrigation water can leach that salt
away<00:03:03.670> from<00:03:04.180> your<00:03:04.329> asparagus<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.170> impact

you<00:03:52.599> can<00:03:52.900> see<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.109> little<00:03:53.290> bit<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:54.239> beetle

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
you can see a little bit of beetle

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.809 
you can see a little bit of beetle
damage<00:03:55.660> here<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.500> then<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> larvae<00:03:57.790> are

damage here and then the larvae are
going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.209> hatch<00:03:58.840> from<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.290> eggs<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.799> they'll

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
going to hatch from the eggs and they'll

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.309 
going to hatch from the eggs and they'll
also<00:04:00.280> feed<00:04:00.519> on<00:04:00.669> this<00:04:00.819> shoot<00:04:01.120> now<00:04:01.720> because<00:04:02.109> they

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
also feed on this shoot now because they

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.930 
also feed on this shoot now because they
lay<00:04:02.470> their<00:04:02.650> eggs<00:04:02.829> right<00:04:03.099> up<00:04:03.250> on<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.519> chute<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
lay their eggs right up on the chute and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.210 
lay their eggs right up on the chute and
we<00:04:04.030> eat<00:04:04.209> this<00:04:04.480> just<00:04:05.290> harvesting<00:04:06.099> our
