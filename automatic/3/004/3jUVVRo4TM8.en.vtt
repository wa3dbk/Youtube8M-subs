00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 welcome schÃ¶nherr 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.490
 I hope you can 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
 see me well 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.420
 I do not know if the camera is on 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.200
 I'm not sure 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.759
 Stressed today doing right 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 yes definitely wanted a video 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.470
 make and one is that one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 Quicktipp or even general times 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 again a few five tips for you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 and that's about a job some of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 you probably already have from 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 heard this jubt makes also so be 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 Round here on youtube for those who have it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.649
 do not know yet yes then stay simple 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.649
 tuned 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.440
 yes, and if you hope in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.780
 near you then it is all the better 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 I do not know if the dm has that too 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 it's about the pav brand of larissa i 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 so I use already so long to 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.670
 several years my mother has it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 started me then always a few 5 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.799
 brought by larry i love these 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 So I guess I love those scents 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.210
 because they are super cheap and no matter if 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 it is now the small bottles or 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 hold the slightly larger atomizer so 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 with this brand makes absolute here 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.689
 nothing wrong you see it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.689
 probably already here that is now 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:47.729
 a 90 milliliter great large flat 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.780
 and that is called the tariff in lumens 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.270
 That is a Europe before 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.600
 So I think I find the presentation 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.869
 for the noble I really think 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.210
 and yes, I've had that before 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.770
 and the fragrance that resembled a whole 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.560
 certain hope and I never knew 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.810
 then I do not have to laziness videos 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.100
 Looked at companies also perfume videos 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 I was love know that you cook 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.480
 Just watch my whole movie 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.600
 maybe he is the album 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.170
 it for you here just have a look 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.150
 through and now I do not know that either 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.650
 he always i got you a sample com 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:42.590
 namely from Armani and the Armani them 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.840
 and that's just la called and it smells 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.230
 100 percent like the original from Armani 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.210
 I'll show you so that's one of those 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.650
 mitfahrende packing thus gold at the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.130
 you have always been there 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.260
 Know where to look then 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.260
 would have to look after her is and 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.580
 As I said, most people know that 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 you and even the flacon is like that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.460
 noble so beautiful so really for so 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.460
 a small one for such a small price 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.350
 out and unfortunately I have now 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.890
 I can not do that for you now 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.390
 original show the original flacon 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.690
 As I said I had a sample of it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.430
 I know but that 's even the one 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.570
 Flacon something resembles so the essay 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 So the essay is something something 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.400
 oval googled just after and the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.330
 compare well yes that's one 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.600
 sweetish scents most perhaps 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.890
 will not like him that much 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.890
 I like the weird 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.170
 I also think that's not the case 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.540
 quickly flies on the clothes 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 I have now been a few times 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:21.690
 applied and so it gets scarce 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.910
 super consequently on the day I say now 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.430
 times if you are invited then one 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.220
 does the halt in her handbag purely 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.800
 and then just go in between times 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.710
 above and fresh all this 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 bit up 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.580
 yes as I said it is a difficult one 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.210
 Sweetish scent but I like that very much 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.720
 So I'm not averse to it 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.900
 I have a few at all 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.520
 sweetish scents clear in summer spring 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.930
 This is where you like the summer 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.480
 fresher scents but that is now 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.670
 not so with me so I do not care 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:06.570
 I'm not quite fit now 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.460
 So I continue to see what I see 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.240
 because now it does not matter if it is now 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.830
 a summer scent is or a 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.850
 wintry farm pascom no matter main thing 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.640
 the fragrance smells so this fragrance 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.530
 For example, it really smells like that 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:31.260
 is really a jubilation as the judge very much 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:36.810
 female yes heavy sweet that has so 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.880
 something sweet but also again 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.540
 a little bit of flowery things have to be something 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.070
 exotic 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.660
 So that's how it mixes me so me 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.100
 Do not know if it is a tester at the moment 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.560
 rossmann gives if you can get there 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.730
 can sniff 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.150
 But for the price makes real 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.780
 nothing at all for the free state yes 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:04.320
 absolutely nothing wrong 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:06.090
 look and maybe you also know 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.750
 Armani can not do that at all 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.780
 of course, then I can be 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.240
 anyway recommend this perfume so if 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.020
 you go away in the evening 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.669
 You are invited or to a date 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.229
 I think that's right 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.360
 so it's a good one 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:30.419
 great smell and as I said that 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:34.080
 this is not an original armani so it is 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:37.050
 really thumbs up and that's not 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.199
 Great, yes, as I said I like it 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.690
 scary like it does not fly away 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:46.470
 All too soon, I can give you the same 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.830
 others might be from armani and armani from 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:53.930
 lavive really warmest 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.979
 recommend and just say if you are 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:01.800
 This one knows if you will find it 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:04.199
 you notice the system amani resembles 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.639
 I read a sample and yes so 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:12.120
 I think that it is 100 percent 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:14.159
 afterwards it smells and you did absolutely 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.889
 nothing wrong maybe I have you 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:18.870
 again angefixt 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:21.440
 I do not know that's for everyone 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.440
 let alone
