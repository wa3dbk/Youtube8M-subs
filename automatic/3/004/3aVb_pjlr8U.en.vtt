00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.110
 dignity of the lord of human life

 stayed more or less in the same place 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.430
 point a little left to read a 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.340
 sparks the right 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.019
 a little bit more like that look at the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.120

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.380
 bryant 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.020
 It's worth, and they take away the past 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.610
 before the past in each one where I am 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.140

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.750
 in the most said response that appeared 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.450
 a few or if I do like that I'm 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.770
 average normal good you have stayed 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.810
 half way, but it's worth the 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.830
