00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
fabric so that it's in between these two

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.780 
fabric so that it's in between these two
pieces<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.510> metal<00:02:44.989> here<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:46.519> want<00:02:46.700> to

pull it you'll see that ends are curling
and<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:55.250> forming<00:02:55.790> your<00:02:55.940> double<00:02:56.300> fold<00:02:56.540> bias

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810

now<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> always<00:03:20.540> do<00:03:20.870> an<00:03:20.989> experiment<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.769> test<00:03:22.100> a

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
now I always do an experiment I test a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.940 
now I always do an experiment I test a
piece<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.700> fabric<00:03:23.079> before<00:03:24.079> I<00:03:24.320> actually<00:03:24.590> work

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
piece of fabric before I actually work

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.090 
piece of fabric before I actually work
on<00:03:25.160> my<00:03:25.340> large<00:03:25.610> quilt<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:27.230> stitch<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.769> like

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
on my large quilt the stitch that I like

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.190 
on my large quilt the stitch that I like
to<00:03:28.280> use<00:03:28.519> is<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:30.230> curly<00:03:31.220> stitch<00:03:31.549> on<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.570> horizon

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
to use is a curly stitch on the horizon

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.660 
to use is a curly stitch on the horizon
if<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.860> machine<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.400> stitch

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
if you have that machine at stitch

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.750 
if you have that machine at stitch
number<00:03:34.940> 100<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.260> zigzag<00:03:36.860> or<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.280> straight

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
number 100 but a zigzag or a straight

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.599 
number 100 but a zigzag or a straight
stitch<00:03:38.120> works<00:03:38.570> equally<00:03:39.049> well<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.220> feed

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
stitch works equally well so you feed

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.069 
stitch works equally well so you feed
your<00:03:40.760> fabric<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.690> see<00:03:44.900> where<00:03:45.049> that

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
your fabric so you can see where that

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.780 
your fabric so you can see where that
goes<00:03:45.380> so<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.799> going<00:03:46.010> right<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.579> between

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
goes so it's going right in between

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.210 
goes so it's going right in between
there<00:03:48.790> lower<00:03:49.790> your<00:03:50.090> presser<00:03:50.299> foot<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:51.220> start

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
there lower your presser foot and start

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.680 
there lower your presser foot and start
stitching

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.950 

now<00:03:57.690> as<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.930> said<00:03:58.170> you'll<00:03:58.380> want<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.740> adjust<00:03:59.010> your

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.690 
now as I said you'll want to adjust your
position<00:04:00.960> of<00:04:01.170> your<00:04:01.200> binder<00:04:01.830> depending<00:04:02.400> on<00:04:02.520> how

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
position of your binder depending on how

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.020 
position of your binder depending on how
the<00:04:02.760> stitches<00:04:03.420> are<00:04:04.140> landing<00:04:04.710> on<00:04:04.950> your<00:04:05.220> binding

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
the stitches are landing on your binding

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.350 
the stitches are landing on your binding
and<00:04:06.210> how<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.420> want<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:06.960> to<00:04:07.140> look

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.120 

so<00:04:14.360> now<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.630> can<00:04:14.990> see<00:04:15.230> what<00:04:15.410> I've<00:04:15.530> done<00:04:15.710> is<00:04:15.890> too

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so now you can see what I've done is too

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.000 
so now you can see what I've done is too
close<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.490> my<00:04:16.880> edge<00:04:17.210> on<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.690> outside<00:04:17.960> edge<00:04:18.500> so

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
close to my edge on this outside edge so

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.830 
close to my edge on this outside edge so
I<00:04:19.040> need<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.430> adjust<00:04:19.550> my<00:04:19.910> binder<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.690> my

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
I need to adjust my binder so that my

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.900 
I need to adjust my binder so that my
stitches<00:04:21.260> are<00:04:21.350> coming<00:04:21.710> closer<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.610> edge

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
stitches are coming closer to this edge

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.180 
stitches are coming closer to this edge
inside<00:04:23.630> label<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.200> adjust<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.710> binder<00:04:25.070> I'm

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
inside label to adjust the binder I'm

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.730 
inside label to adjust the binder I'm
going<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.520> loosen<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> screws<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.870> I'm<00:04:27.380> going

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
going to loosen the screws and I'm going

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.370 
going to loosen the screws and I'm going
to<00:04:27.800> slide<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.760> my<00:04:28.940> right<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:32.050> then<00:04:33.050> tighten

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
to slide it to my right and then tighten

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:51.050 
to slide it to my right and then tighten
my<00:04:33.500> screws<00:04:33.800> again

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.520 

so<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.389> where<00:04:52.569> you<00:04:52.689> want<00:04:52.960> your<00:04:53.139> stitching

so this is where you want your stitching

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.499 
so this is where you want your stitching
to<00:04:53.680> land<00:04:53.919> just<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.639> it's<00:04:54.789> coming<00:04:55.060> off<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
to land just so that it's coming off the

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.679 
to land just so that it's coming off the
fold<00:04:55.840> or<00:04:56.139> just<00:04:57.039> almost<00:04:57.310> at<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.819> fold<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.330> your

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689
