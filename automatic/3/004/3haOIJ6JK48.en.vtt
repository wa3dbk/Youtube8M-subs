 and talk a little about 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.629
 This is a video on YouTube you are 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.590
 to demonstrate the landscape of the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.810
 video is a very good quality and the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.400
 images are very beautiful on animals at 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.069
 costa rica and the image quality is very 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 good is allowed even 4 each a stiffness 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.640
 awesome is this is how you just go 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.849
 to be able to observe difference 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.989
 Even you can already see the difference already 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.230
 guides the details you can see 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.389
 small details you do not see in the picture 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:57.329
 full hd image gets too rigid 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:03:02.310
 even does not give a good feeling that 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.849
 is at 4k at 30 fps 30 reze is being 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.849
 wheeled 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.820
 pretty bad 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:16.090
 how do you sing when you move away from the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.580
 place is you distance more 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.100
 television is in case the picture will lose 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.160
 the quality then in the perception does not 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.410
 It's so struggling while when you 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.860
 for example from the transition to 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.350
 usb pro ht is very big difference 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.410
 but 14 car makes a big difference 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.010
 but she is not is not so brutal that the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 difference of s day pro hd sd in case of 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.670
 low standard definition even like 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.070
 day 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.660
 I'll show you another video to show. 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.660
 what a difference to you 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:10.170
 I would say it's very good, I'll put this 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:15.990
 another here he will compare the pictures 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.860
 in full hd 1080p with 14 here the case he 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.680
 makes a comparison that was filmed in 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:32.190
 several in our resolutions and 4k 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:37.860
 kept at home from the difference or 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.900
 four cars in the indy since the image is 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.580
 bigger but you can see the little ones 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.840
 details they can not see outside 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.840
 have to stay in 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:55.959
 the segment the details of the leaf give neither 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:02.270
 in case hd you can see but not 

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:04.380
 do not have the mind is good 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.930
 here you can see a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.700
 Abritta, you can not even see us. 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:18.480
 May in a personal tone is Hindu media 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:21.090
 showing you a case my river 4 case 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.890
 Tvi is very good but unfortunately 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.470
 four fall little content then in case 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.200
 will not have so much option to watch 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.700
 more shape the bitch frame actually gives 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.470
 a difference 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.050
 only the difference of the fourth place for 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.710
 the full hd is not as big as the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.030
 definition is that of 480 lines for me 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.490
 80 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.990
