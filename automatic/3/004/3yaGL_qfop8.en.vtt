00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
now it's going to take a bit so I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.420 
now it's going to take a bit so I
propose<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.899> when<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> let<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.009> download

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
propose and when you let that download

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.400 
propose and when you let that download
you<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.880> same<00:02:11.090> thing<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.630> what<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.230> did

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
you do the same thing with what you did

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.700 
you do the same thing with what you did
with<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:16.630> actual<00:02:17.630> emulator<00:02:18.080> pardon<00:02:18.650> me

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
with the the actual emulator pardon me

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.670 
with the the actual emulator pardon me
and<00:02:19.840> put<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.960> into<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:23.510> right<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.230> CD

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and put it into this right here CD

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.220 
and put it into this right here CD
images<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.970> when<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.240> open<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.720> when

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
images this is when you open the when

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.680 
images this is when you open the when
you<00:02:27.350> open<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.680> emulator<00:02:28.100> it'll<00:02:28.880> load<00:02:29.060> all<00:02:29.390> of

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you open the emulator it'll load all of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.490 
you open the emulator it'll load all of
its<00:02:29.840> roms<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.400> case<00:02:31.640> CD<00:02:32.060> images<00:02:32.500> from

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
its roms or in this case CD images from

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.410 
its roms or in this case CD images from
this<00:02:33.740> file<00:02:34.040> even<00:02:34.970> says<00:02:35.300> put<00:02:35.690> CD<00:02:35.990> images<00:02:36.380> here

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this file even says put CD images here

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
this file even says put CD images here
so<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> already<00:02:38.990> downloaded<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.680> thing<00:02:39.920> into<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
so I already downloaded the thing into a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
so I already downloaded the thing into a
different<00:02:40.730> file<00:02:41.300> where<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.570> put<00:02:41.750> all<00:02:41.930> my

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
different file where I put all my

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.949 
different file where I put all my
emulations<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.030> I'm<00:02:44.300> actually<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.810> gonna

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
emulations so I'm actually just gonna

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.560 
emulations so I'm actually just gonna
take<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> easy<00:02:45.709> way<00:02:46.130> out<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.580> I'm<00:02:47.180> gonna<00:02:47.330> go

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
take the easy way out and I'm gonna go

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.090 
take the easy way out and I'm gonna go
and<00:02:47.980> take<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.280> ROM<00:02:49.750> there<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.770> put<00:02:51.980> it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and take the ROM there it is and put it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:09.490 
and take the ROM there it is and put it
into<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:55.000> CD<00:02:56.000> images<00:02:56.330> for<00:02:56.540> here

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500

run this emulator this might happen to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.350 
run this emulator this might happen to
you<00:03:38.600> you'll<00:03:39.290> try<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.620> open<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.190> well<00:03:41.090> I'll<00:03:41.180> tell

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
you you'll try to open it well I'll tell

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.750 
you you'll try to open it well I'll tell
you<00:03:41.450> what<00:03:41.600> language<00:03:41.930> obviously<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:43.220> emulator

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
you what language obviously the emulator

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.360 
you what language obviously the emulator
requires<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.390> bios<00:03:45.020> image<00:03:45.500> which<00:03:45.980> must<00:03:46.220> be

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
requires a bios image which must be

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.729 
requires a bios image which must be
installed<00:03:46.610> into<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> BIOS<00:03:47.360> folder<00:03:47.810> they

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
installed into the BIOS folder they

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.260 
installed into the BIOS folder they
probably<00:03:48.980> think<00:03:49.190> in<00:03:49.310> one<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.880> didn't<00:03:50.120> come

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
probably think in one and it didn't come

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.380 
probably think in one and it didn't come
with<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.510> BIOS<00:03:51.080> thing<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.920> then<00:03:52.520> it'll<00:03:52.700> bring

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
with a BIOS thing and then it'll bring

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.210 
with a BIOS thing and then it'll bring
up<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.840> pop<00:03:54.110> up<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.620> what<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.010> should

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
up this pop up and what you should

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.770 
up this pop up and what you should
select<00:03:55.430> there's<00:03:56.000> not<00:03:56.180> there's<00:03:56.420> not<00:03:56.600> gonna<00:03:56.690> be

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
select there's not there's not gonna be

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.210 
select there's not there's not gonna be
anything<00:03:57.080> in<00:03:57.350> there<00:03:57.500> for<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.040> select

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
anything in there for you to select

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.640 
anything in there for you to select
it'll<00:03:58.580> just<00:03:58.760> close<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.090> emulator<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.530> what

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
it'll just close the emulator so what

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.229 
it'll just close the emulator so what
you're<00:04:00.739> gonna<00:04:00.830> want<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.160> do<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.610> you're<00:04:02.150> gonna

obscure<00:04:23.419> site<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:26.270> download<00:04:26.510> this<00:04:27.440> one

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
obscure site and you download this one

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.190 
obscure site and you download this one
right<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:28.130> not<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.910> not<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.270> not<00:04:29.990> even

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
right here not that not that not even

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.520 
right here not that not that not even
that<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:32.830> once<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.010> downloads<00:04:34.040> that<00:04:35.530> see

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
that this one once it downloads that see

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.440 
that this one once it downloads that see
it'll<00:04:36.710> take<00:04:36.919> us<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.370> quick<00:04:37.760> time<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.240> don't

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
it'll take us a quick time so I don't

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.980 
it'll take us a quick time so I don't
have<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.780> use<00:04:39.620> any<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.100> files<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.580> have

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
have to use any of the files that I have

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.930 
have to use any of the files that I have
so<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.050> open<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.560> up<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.310> do<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.550> same<00:04:43.729> thing

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
so you open it up and do the same thing

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.300 
so you open it up and do the same thing
you<00:04:44.030> did<00:04:44.150> before<00:04:44.320> it'll<00:04:45.320> actually<00:04:45.500> open<00:04:45.830> the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
you did before it'll actually open the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.159 
you did before it'll actually open the
readme<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.940> WinRAR<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.720> if<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.930> want<00:04:48.080> to
