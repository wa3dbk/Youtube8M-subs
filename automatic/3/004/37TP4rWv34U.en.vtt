00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
and the film in you is actually I think

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.050 
and the film in you is actually I think
slightly<00:02:23.670> better<00:02:24.120> player<00:02:24.660> than<00:02:25.140> sterling

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
slightly better player than sterling

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480 
slightly better player than sterling
then<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.570> could<00:02:27.750> move<00:02:27.959> use<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.620> 50<00:02:28.980> million<00:02:29.160> to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
then we could move use the 50 million to

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.490 
then we could move use the 50 million to
make<00:02:29.640> me<00:02:29.790> sign<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> defensive<00:02:30.810> midfielder<00:02:30.900> like

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.490 
make me sign a defensive midfielder like
Illarramendi<00:02:32.220> maybe<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.970> could<00:02:33.150> sign<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
Illarramendi maybe we could sign a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
Illarramendi maybe we could sign a
another<00:02:34.500> attacking<00:02:34.920> midfielder<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.910> an<00:02:36.900> also

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
another attacking midfielder and an also

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.949 
another attacking midfielder and an also
big<00:02:37.560> striker<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.270> very<00:02:39.660> very

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
big striker so so this is a very very

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.880 
big striker so so this is a very very
interesting<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:41.250> find<00:02:41.459> out<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:43.350> Liverpool

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
interesting to find out how we Liverpool

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.490 
interesting to find out how we Liverpool
behave<00:02:44.489> now<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:45.060> will<00:02:45.120> they<00:02:45.480> act<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.080> think

behave now how will they act but I think

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.640 
behave now how will they act but I think
I<00:02:46.770> think<00:02:47.760> sterling<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.690> his<00:02:48.900> agent<00:02:49.410> are
