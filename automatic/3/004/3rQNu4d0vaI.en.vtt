00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090 

we've<00:00:00.719> got<00:00:00.960> red<00:00:01.199> grapes<00:00:01.500> these<00:00:01.920> are

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
we've got red grapes these are

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.490 
we've got red grapes these are
absolutely<00:00:02.490> gorgeous<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.990> think<00:00:04.350> then

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
absolutely gorgeous and I think then

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.950 
absolutely gorgeous and I think then
we're<00:00:04.680> alone<00:00:04.890> not<00:00:05.250> really<00:00:05.490> sure<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> they

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
we're alone not really sure and they

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.600 
we're alone not really sure and they
grow<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.230> my<00:00:07.410> allotment<00:00:07.680> but<00:00:10.340> anything<00:00:11.340> shot

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
grow on my allotment but anything shot

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.509 
grow on my allotment but anything shot
and<00:00:12.080> they've<00:00:13.080> been<00:00:13.290> washed<00:00:13.530> under<00:00:14.070> running

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and they've been washed under running

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.300 
and they've been washed under running
tap<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.900> bucket<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.650> I'll<00:00:16.770> collect<00:00:16.949> them<00:00:17.160> in

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
tap the bucket that I'll collect them in

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.790 
tap the bucket that I'll collect them in
I<00:00:17.460> always<00:00:17.789> spray<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.359> them<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:19.590> some

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I always spray it with them with some

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
I always spray it with them with some
sterilizer<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.699> simplest<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.340> us<00:00:23.930> not

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
sterilizer and simplest way for us not

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.040 
sterilizer and simplest way for us not
having<00:00:24.960> lots<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> equipment<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.310> simply

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
having lots of equipment is to simply

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
having lots of equipment is to simply
strip<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.699> stripping<00:00:29.970> them<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
strip them and as I'm stripping them I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.260 
strip them and as I'm stripping them I
squeeze<00:00:30.900> them<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:32.719> into<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> bucket

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
squeeze them a little bit into a bucket

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.810 
squeeze them a little bit into a bucket
like<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:40.129> before<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.399> much

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like so that is before we go much

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170 
like so that is before we go much
further<00:00:42.410> we<00:00:43.410> need<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.770> test<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.250> see<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:45.030> make

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
further we need to test to see to make

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
further we need to test to see to make
sure<00:00:45.649> give<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> strike<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
sure give out the strike and what the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.369 
sure give out the strike and what the
specific<00:00:50.940> gravity<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> eventually

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
specific gravity is so that eventually

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.010 
specific gravity is so that eventually
we<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:52.890> calculate<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> amount<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.530> sugar

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
we can calculate the amount of sugar

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
we can calculate the amount of sugar
that's<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:01:00.230> there<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's in the there we go and now that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.859 
that's in the there we go and now that
is<00:01:03.090> reading<00:01:04.070> 74<00:01:05.510> which<00:01:06.510> isn't<00:01:06.720> bad

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
is reading 74 which isn't bad

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.469 
is reading 74 which isn't bad
considering<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.070> sir<00:01:08.430> English<00:01:09.650> English<00:01:10.650> red

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
considering that sir English English red

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
considering that sir English English red
that's<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.659> bad<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.560> also<00:01:13.770> quite<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that's not bad this there's also quite a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's not bad this there's also quite a
lot<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:16.070> rubbish<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:18.450> from

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
lot of them rubbish in there from from

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
lot of them rubbish in there from from
from<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> greater<00:01:19.380> than<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.130> been

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
from the greater than I just been

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.120 
from the greater than I just been
squeeze<00:01:21.020> all<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.590> we've<00:01:22.860> got

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
squeeze all right so now we've got

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.880 
squeeze all right so now we've got
roughly<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.180> gallon<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:25.909> them<00:01:27.049> red<00:01:28.049> grapes<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
roughly a gallon of them red grapes in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760 
roughly a gallon of them red grapes in
there<00:01:29.130> crushed<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:30.329> by<00:01:30.540> hand<00:01:30.900> we're<00:01:31.650> going

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there crushed just by hand we're going

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
there crushed just by hand we're going
to<00:01:31.860> leave<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.759> 10<00:01:32.939> days<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to leave them in there for 10 days to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
to leave them in there for 10 days to
extract<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> color<00:01:34.700> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
extract the color from the from the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.410 
extract the color from the from the
skins<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> grape<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> our<00:01:38.430> next<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
skins of the grape and our next thing is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.250 
skins of the grape and our next thing is
we're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> add<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.700> kandan<00:01:41.700> tablets

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.350 

so<00:01:50.800> there<00:01:51.800> we<00:01:51.980> go<00:01:52.010> crush<00:01:52.610> them<00:01:52.760> up<00:01:52.850> cling<00:01:53.180> to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
so there we go crush them up cling to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.690 
so there we go crush them up cling to
your<00:01:53.540> bones

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
your bones

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.230 
your bones
and<00:01:55.700> shake<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.260> mix<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.980> up<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and shake it in and mix it up and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.040 
and shake it in and mix it up and
that'll<00:01:59.630> end

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
that'll end

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.400 
that'll end
next<00:02:00.800> stop<00:02:01.160> any<00:02:01.370> infection<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.330> we<00:02:03.200> might

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
next stop any infection that we might

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.310 
next stop any infection that we might
have<00:02:03.530> picked<00:02:03.710> up<00:02:04.510> whilst<00:02:05.510> we've<00:02:05.810> been<00:02:05.960> doing

Camden tablets in our 24 hours I'm now
going<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.430> sprinkle<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.510> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> use

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
going to sprinkle in I'm going to use
