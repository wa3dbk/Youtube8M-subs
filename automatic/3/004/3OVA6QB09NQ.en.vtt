center of this kind of ornate vine

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.650 
center of this kind of ornate vine
pattern<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> animates<00:00:25.200> on<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:27.090> wanted

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
pattern as it animates on and I wanted

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060 
pattern as it animates on and I wanted
something<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.259> could<00:00:28.439> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.950> an

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
something that I could kind of do in an

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
something that I could kind of do in an
evening<00:00:29.250> something<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.970> wouldn't<00:00:30.210> take<00:00:30.450> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
evening something that wouldn't take a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.630 
evening something that wouldn't take a
lot<00:00:31.649> of<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:31.860> so<00:00:33.800> let<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:34.890> show<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.220> I<00:00:35.430> did

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
lot of time so let me show you how I did

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.910 
lot of time so let me show you how I did
with<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:37.520> drew<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.760> sketch<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
with this I drew this sketch in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.250 
with this I drew this sketch in
Photoshop<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.020> I<00:00:43.020> wanted<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.980> create<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
Photoshop and I wanted to create a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.620 
Photoshop and I wanted to create a
repeated<00:00:46.260> pattern<00:00:46.290> so<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.040> I<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.820> own<00:00:48.150> so<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
repeated pattern so that I can own so I

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.300 
repeated pattern so that I can own so I
only<00:00:48.840> we'd<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.380> need<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> animate<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
only we'd really need to animate a

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.270 
only we'd really need to animate a
portion<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:52.170> once<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.100> could

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
portion of this once and then I could

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
portion of this once and then I could
duplicate<00:00:53.580> it<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.030> scale<00:00:54.330> it<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.500> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
duplicate it and scale it up so you can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.590 
duplicate it and scale it up so you can
see<00:00:55.740> this<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:58.410> area<00:00:58.800> here<00:01:00.020> we've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.130> this

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
see this this area here we've got this

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
see this this area here we've got this
you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.720> vine<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.650> comes<00:01:04.890> around<00:01:05.070> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you know vine that comes around like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
you know vine that comes around like
this<00:01:05.549> find<00:01:06.090> lip<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this find lip that and then we have a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.520 
this find lip that and then we have a
little<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.390> three<00:01:09.720> three

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little one like that in like three three

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
little one like that in like three three
leaves<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.649> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
leaves so as you can see this is the the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.440 
leaves so as you can see this is the the
same<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.140> thats<00:01:16.550> everywhere<00:01:17.550> so<00:01:18.090> we've<00:01:18.270> got

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
same thing thats everywhere so we've got

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
same thing thats everywhere so we've got
this<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.140> flipped<00:01:19.590> mirrored<00:01:20.190> this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this one this is flipped mirrored this

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
this one this is flipped mirrored this
is<00:01:21.090> mirrored<00:01:22.220> comes<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is mirrored comes around this is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
is mirrored comes around this is
mirrored<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.810> basically<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.409> same

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
mirrored so it's basically the same

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
mirrored so it's basically the same
animation<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.640> repeated<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.140> over

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
animation that's repeated over and over

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.660 
animation that's repeated over and over
and<00:01:28.500> over<00:01:28.620> again<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:32.060> was<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.090> plan<00:01:33.870> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and over again so that was my plan and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.170 
and over again so that was my plan and
let<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:38.030> very<00:01:39.030> first

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
let me take you down to the very first

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.149 
let me take you down to the very first
one<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:41.760> I<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.920> okay<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> vine

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
one that I did okay so this is the vine

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.440 
one that I did okay so this is the vine
group<00:01:48.200> right<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
group right here we can see the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
group right here we can see the
animation<00:01:52.520> happening<00:01:53.520> right<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
animation happening right here in the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.730 
animation happening right here in the
museum<00:01:54.330> in

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.660 

so<00:02:00.130> you're<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.579> growing<00:02:01.060> like<00:02:01.270> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so you're going to growing like that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.010 
so you're going to growing like that
okay<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:03.939> turn<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.270> off<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.720> can<00:02:04.810> see

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
okay and we turn that off so you can see

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.870 
okay and we turn that off so you can see
that<00:02:05.170> i<00:02:05.229> use<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.680> as<00:02:05.799> my<00:02:05.979> pattern<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.640> i

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
that i use that as my pattern and i

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.820 
that i use that as my pattern and i
think<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.840> always<00:02:08.020> important<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.770> a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
think it's always important to have a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.210 
think it's always important to have a
plan<00:02:09.130> when<00:02:10.030> you're<00:02:10.179> doing<00:02:10.450> anything<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.950> I've

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
plan when you're doing anything so I've

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.110 
plan when you're doing anything so I've
got<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> layer<00:02:12.849> for<00:02:13.330> each<00:02:14.130> each<00:02:15.130> fine<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.970> each

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
got a layer for each each fine in each

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.479 
got a layer for each each fine in each
leaf<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.890> one<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.430> down

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
leaf and you can see this one right down

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.430 
leaf and you can see this one right down
here<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> scaling<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.750> actually<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.739> visible

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
here a scaling is actually not visible

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.050 
here a scaling is actually not visible
so<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.519> one<00:02:27.849> that's<00:02:28.060> growing<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:30.060> does

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
so it's this one that's growing and does

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.180 
so it's this one that's growing and does
that<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.660> that's<00:02:31.870> basically<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:32.830> did<00:02:32.950> on

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
that so that's basically what I did on

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.590 
that so that's basically what I did on
those<00:02:33.340> guys<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:35.160> each<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.220> kind<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.180> connects

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
those guys is each one kind of connects

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.600 
those guys is each one kind of connects
to<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.519> other<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:40.870> these<00:02:41.049> are<00:02:41.260> shapes<00:02:42.069> in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
to the other one now these are shapes in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.180

as much as they are paths each one of
these<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.400> path<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.180> i<00:02:46.810> used<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.500> variable

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
these a path and i used the variable

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
these a path and i used the variable
width<00:02:48.880> line<00:02:49.660> width<00:02:51.989> tool<00:02:52.989> for<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.870> i

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
width line width tool for that what i

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.890 
width line width tool for that what i
did<00:02:56.230> was<00:02:56.530> i<00:02:56.849> used<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.150> i<00:02:58.360> have<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> drawing

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
did was i used this i have a drawing

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.880 
did was i used this i have a drawing
tablet<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.709> get<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.010> started<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:01.319> used<00:03:02.319> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
tablet so to get it started I used the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.509 
tablet so to get it started I used the
pen<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:04.000> pencil<00:03:04.510> tool<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.829> draw<00:03:06.160> out<00:03:06.459> my

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
pen this pencil tool to draw out my

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.900 
pen this pencil tool to draw out my
basic<00:03:07.180> shapes<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.829> either<00:03:09.010> added<00:03:09.459> points

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
basic shapes and I either added points

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.770 
basic shapes and I either added points
or<00:03:10.030> deleted<00:03:10.420> points<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.970> adjusted<00:03:12.970> my<00:03:13.030> variable

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
or deleted points I adjusted my variable

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.949 
or deleted points I adjusted my variable
widths<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:18.070> these<00:03:19.000> paths<00:03:19.329> for<00:03:19.630> instance

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
widths on on these paths for instance

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.670 
widths on on these paths for instance
right<00:03:20.140> here<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:21.549> know<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:22.090> make<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.680> line

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
right here you know I can make this line

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.449 
right here you know I can make this line
thicker<00:03:24.190> or<00:03:24.310> thinner<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:26.170> know<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.890> width<00:03:27.130> I

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
thicker or thinner you know the width I

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.580 
thicker or thinner you know the width I
can<00:03:27.670> adjust<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.329> that's<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.660> attribute<00:03:29.560> that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
can adjust and that's the attribute that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.030 
can adjust and that's the attribute that
you<00:03:29.859> can<00:03:30.069> actually<00:03:30.310> animate<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.180> anime<00:03:31.569> studio

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you can actually animate in anime studio

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.190 
you can actually animate in anime studio
which<00:03:33.040> makes<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.549> really<00:03:33.609> nice<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.780> when<00:03:35.079> you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
which makes it really nice so when you

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.599 
which makes it really nice so when you
see<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:36.310> guy<00:03:36.549> come<00:03:36.819> down<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:39.400> gets

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
see this guy come down like this it gets

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.039 
see this guy come down like this it gets
little<00:03:39.880> thicker<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.390> then<00:03:40.510> thick<00:03:40.750> earnest

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
little thicker and then thick earnest

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.759 
little thicker and then thick earnest
just<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.500> thickness<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:43.060> thickness<00:03:43.769> comes

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
just a thickness the thickness comes

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.539 
just a thickness the thickness comes
around<00:03:45.069> like<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.989> have<00:03:47.549> the

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
around like that because I have the

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.259 
around like that because I have the
variable<00:03:49.799> with<00:03:50.799> adjusted<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.670> do<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:52.060> at

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
variable with adjusted to do that at

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.960 
variable with adjusted to do that at
that<00:03:52.329> point<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:52.900> time<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.950> since<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.670> you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
that point in time so since I can you

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.400 
that point in time so since I can you
can<00:03:55.120> animate<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.870> same<00:03:56.079> thing<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.380> the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
can animate that the same thing with the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.090 
can animate that the same thing with the
leaves<00:03:56.709> leaves<00:03:57.670> like<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.380> comes<00:03:59.380> around<00:03:59.799> and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
leaves leaves like this comes around and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.640 
leaves leaves like this comes around and
it<00:04:00.280> dips<00:04:00.459> down<00:04:00.579> because<00:04:01.239> I'm<00:04:01.540> adjusting<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
it dips down because I'm adjusting the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.180 
it dips down because I'm adjusting the
variable<00:04:03.069> width<00:04:03.310> across<00:04:04.030> these<00:04:04.540> keyframes<00:04:05.190> so

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
variable width across these keyframes so

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.959 
variable width across these keyframes so
once<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.549> have<00:04:06.790> once<00:04:07.389> I<00:04:07.510> had<00:04:07.630> one<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.169> these<00:04:08.549> guys

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:10.969 
once I have once I had one of these guys

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.089 
once I have once I had one of these guys
what<00:04:11.969> I<00:04:12.000> ended<00:04:12.239> up<00:04:12.360> doing<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:13.409> point<00:04:13.980> in

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
what I ended up doing at that point in

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.360 
what I ended up doing at that point in
time<00:04:14.129> I'm<00:04:14.579> going<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.790> turn<00:04:15.060> on<00:04:15.329> my<00:04:16.190> my<00:04:17.190> preview

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
time I'm going to turn on my my preview

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.010 
time I'm going to turn on my my preview
you<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.400> see<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.820> shading<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:24.020> these

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you can see the shading that is on these

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.120 
you can see the shading that is on these
guys<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:26.610> was<00:04:26.850> done<00:04:27.259> by<00:04:28.259> using<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.800> fill

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
guys that was done by using the fill

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.390 
guys that was done by using the fill
here<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.530> having<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:32.690> shading<00:04:35.330> set<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.449> black

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
here and having a shading set to black

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.879 
here and having a shading set to black
the<00:04:38.400> alpha<00:04:38.880> channel<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.990> opacity<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.680> about

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
the alpha channel the opacity is about

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.520 
the alpha channel the opacity is about
halfway<00:04:41.160> up<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:44.599> for<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.289> that's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
halfway up and for that and so that's

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.330 
halfway up and for that and so that's
what's<00:04:46.830> creating<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.810> shade<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.039> on

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
what's creating this shade and so on

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.189 
what's creating this shade and so on
each<00:04:50.550> one<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.150> these<00:04:51.449> I<00:04:51.780> have<00:04:52.560> shaded<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:54.199> on

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
each one of these I have shaded and on

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.850 
each one of these I have shaded and on
this<00:04:55.320> when<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.770> leaves<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.099> have<00:04:56.250> halo<00:04:56.669> set<00:04:57.860> and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
this when the leaves I have halo set and

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.810 
this when the leaves I have halo set and
the<00:04:59.070> halo<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.759> don't<00:04:59.940> see<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> preview

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
the halo you don't see in the preview

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
the halo you don't see in the preview
but<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:03.030> nice<00:05:03.270> here<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.970> this<00:05:05.970> program

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
but it is nice here in in this program

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.430 
but it is nice here in in this program
in<00:05:07.080> anime<00:05:07.349> studio<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.190> can<00:05:08.460> see<00:05:09.440> the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
in anime studio that you can see the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.700 
in anime studio that you can see the
halo<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:11.070> mean<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.300> actual<00:05:12.449> shading<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.259> a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
halo I mean the the actual shading on a

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.490 
halo I mean the the actual shading on a
stroke<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:15.240> basically<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.199> know<00:05:16.289> it's<00:05:16.440> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
stroke it's basically you know it's a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.469 
stroke it's basically you know it's a
shaded<00:05:16.860> stroke<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.780> once<00:05:19.080> i<00:05:19.199> had<00:05:20.479> this

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
shaded stroke so once i had this

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.040 
shaded stroke so once i had this
animation<00:05:21.930> done<00:05:23.030> all<00:05:24.030> i<00:05:24.090> did<00:05:24.449> at<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:24.659> point

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
animation done all i did at that point

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.640 
animation done all i did at that point
in<00:05:25.139> time<00:05:25.639> was<00:05:27.050> i'm<00:05:28.050> going<00:05:28.199> to<00:05:28.289> turn<00:05:28.470> this

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
in time was i'm going to turn this

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.680 
in time was i'm going to turn this
quality<00:05:29.130> back<00:05:29.370> down<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.970> medium<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:32.449> so<00:05:33.449> i<00:05:33.510> can

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
quality back down to medium and so i can

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.089 
quality back down to medium and so i can
show<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.050> other<00:05:34.289> stuff<00:05:34.620> without<00:05:34.770> it

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
show you the other stuff without it

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.219 
show you the other stuff without it
waiting<00:05:35.849> too<00:05:36.030> long<00:05:37.699> so<00:05:38.699> i<00:05:38.940> duplicated<00:05:39.690> i<00:05:39.960> put

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
waiting too long so i duplicated i put

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.439 
waiting too long so i duplicated i put
that<00:05:40.380> in<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.620> group<00:05:40.860> put<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.789> vine<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.270> leaf

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
that in a group put the vine and leaf

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.750 
that in a group put the vine and leaf
everything<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.139> group<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:43.560> then<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.490> just

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
everything in a group and then I just

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.930 
everything in a group and then I just
duplicated<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.870> group's<00:05:46.740> pum<00:05:47.370> pum<00:05:47.580> pum<00:05:47.729> pum

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
duplicated the group's pum pum pum pum

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.980 
duplicated the group's pum pum pum pum
pum<00:05:48.199> so<00:05:49.199> you<00:05:49.289> can<00:05:49.440> see<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.680> 1i<00:05:50.099> mirrored<00:05:50.729> that

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
pum so you can see that 1i mirrored that

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.040 
pum so you can see that 1i mirrored that
same<00:05:51.990> group<00:05:52.320> same<00:05:52.620> animation<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.840> then<00:05:54.840> I

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
same group same animation and then I

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.250 
same group same animation and then I
just<00:05:55.229> kept<00:05:55.470> making<00:05:55.940> groups<00:05:58.099> and<00:05:59.900> what<00:06:00.900> I<00:06:00.930> did

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
just kept making groups and what I did

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.670 
just kept making groups and what I did
then<00:06:01.470> is<00:06:01.830> on<00:06:02.039> the<00:06:02.430> layers<00:06:03.050> here<00:06:04.050> you<00:06:04.380> know<00:06:04.530> as

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
then is on the layers here you know as

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.800 
then is on the layers here you know as
far<00:06:04.860> as<00:06:04.979> positioning<00:06:05.220> of<00:06:05.729> layers<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.509> sort

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
far as positioning of layers that sort

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.430 
far as positioning of layers that sort
of<00:06:06.840> thing<00:06:06.930> I<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.930> know<00:06:09.960> I<00:06:10.349> used<00:06:10.979> i<00:06:12.199> use<00:06:13.199> the

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
of thing I you know I used i use the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.820 
of thing I you know I used i use the
layer<00:06:13.680> positioning<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.930> rotation<00:06:15.930> of

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
layer positioning and the rotation of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.529 
layer positioning and the rotation of
layers<00:06:18.229> to<00:06:19.820> put<00:06:20.820> these<00:06:21.000> things<00:06:21.240> where<00:06:21.419> they

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
layers to put these things where they

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.090 
layers to put these things where they
needed<00:06:21.719> to<00:06:21.840> be<00:06:21.930> based<00:06:22.320> on

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
needed to be based on

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.950 
needed to be based on
my<00:06:23.730> template<00:06:24.890> you<00:06:25.890> know<00:06:26.010> so<00:06:26.910> and<00:06:27.510> then<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:27.840> know

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
my template you know so and then I know

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.430 
my template you know so and then I know
exactly<00:06:28.500> where<00:06:28.950> I<00:06:29.010> was<00:06:29.220> going<00:06:29.490> with<00:06:29.520> it<00:06:29.670> and

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
exactly where I was going with it and

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.060 
exactly where I was going with it and
that's<00:06:31.440> basically<00:06:32.100> it<00:06:32.700> you<00:06:33.570> know<00:06:33.860> other<00:06:34.860> than

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
that's basically it you know other than

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.790 
that's basically it you know other than
that<00:06:35.160> I've<00:06:35.520> put<00:06:35.790> all<00:06:35.820> of<00:06:35.970> them<00:06:36.390> in<00:06:36.630> one<00:06:36.800> big

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
that I've put all of them in one big

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.430 
that I've put all of them in one big
group<00:06:38.010> now<00:06:38.310> just<00:06:39.000> so<00:06:39.180> that<00:06:39.420> I<00:06:39.450> can<00:06:39.660> if<00:06:40.290> I<00:06:40.410> want

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
to I can apply a drop shadow to this

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.360 
to I can apply a drop shadow to this
folder<00:06:44.090> you<00:06:45.090> know<00:06:45.240> and<00:06:45.740> here<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:46.770> can<00:06:47.070> get<00:06:47.280> in

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
folder you know and here I can get in

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.610 
folder you know and here I can get in
here<00:06:47.670> and<00:06:47.700> plaid<00:06:48.210> drop<00:06:48.540> shadow<00:06:48.840> or<00:06:49.200> or

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
here and plaid drop shadow or or

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.990 
here and plaid drop shadow or or
something<00:06:50.190> like<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:52.520> it<00:06:53.520> will<00:06:53.640> apply<00:06:53.940> to

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
something like that and it will apply to

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.390 
something like that and it will apply to
this<00:06:54.480> folder<00:06:55.410> which<00:06:55.800> contains<00:06:55.830> all<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.940> rest

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
this folder which contains all the rest

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.620 
this folder which contains all the rest
makes<00:06:59.400> it<00:06:59.580> easier<00:06:59.910> if<00:06:59.970> you<00:07:00.120> especially<00:07:00.330> if<00:07:00.600> you

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
makes it easier if you especially if you

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.620 
makes it easier if you especially if you
want<00:07:00.900> to<00:07:00.930> try<00:07:01.470> different<00:07:01.530> things<00:07:02.630> anyway

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
want to try different things anyway

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.780 
want to try different things anyway
that's<00:07:03.780> so<00:07:04.110> that's<00:07:04.380> my<00:07:04.560> animation<00:07:05.100> so<00:07:05.460> far

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
that's so that's my animation so far

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.850 
that's so that's my animation so far
probably<00:07:06.420> be<00:07:06.870> adding<00:07:07.200> some<00:07:07.230> flowers<00:07:07.830> and

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
probably be adding some flowers and

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.390 
probably be adding some flowers and
stuff<00:07:08.220> to<00:07:08.490> it<00:07:09.650> for<00:07:10.650> the<00:07:10.740> final<00:07:10.890> cartoon<00:07:11.550> but

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
stuff to it for the final cartoon but

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.820 
stuff to it for the final cartoon but
hope<00:07:14.400> it<00:07:14.730> was<00:07:14.910> helpful<00:07:15.170> again<00:07:16.170> these<00:07:16.770> are

hope it was helpful again these are

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.300 
hope it was helpful again these are
variable<00:07:17.310> line<00:07:17.460> widths<00:07:17.850> and<00:07:21.800> yeah<00:07:22.800> if<00:07:23.130> you

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
variable line widths and yeah if you

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.570 
variable line widths and yeah if you
have<00:07:23.430> any<00:07:23.580> questions<00:07:24.000> just<00:07:24.090> let<00:07:24.330> me<00:07:24.450> know
