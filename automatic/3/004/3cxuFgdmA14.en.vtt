00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.440 
okay so now with the first rule removed
here<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.520> end<00:02:22.700> up<00:02:22.820> doing<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.240> by

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
here if you end up doing this by

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.600 
here if you end up doing this by
yourself<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> steel

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
yourself we can do is just take a steel

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.920 
yourself we can do is just take a steel
rake<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.420> this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
rake like this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.430 
rake like this
now<00:02:27.500> if<00:02:27.560> you've<00:02:27.770> made<00:02:27.920> one<00:02:28.190> cut<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:29.440> just

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
now if you've made one cut just just

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.820 
now if you've made one cut just just
pull<00:02:30.680> each<00:02:30.800> piece<00:02:31.040> over<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:32.830> so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
pull each piece over a little bit so

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
pull each piece over a little bit so
that<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.160> opens<00:02:34.460> up<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.670> line<00:02:35.240> there

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that it opens up that line there

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.339 
that it opens up that line there
for<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.660> little<00:02:36.810> pulse

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.140 

and<00:02:44.799> what<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.069> will<00:02:45.159> do<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.489> open<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.939> up

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and what that will do will open that up

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.509 
and what that will do will open that up
so<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.409> see<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.769> line<00:02:47.980> where<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.370> want

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
so you can see that line where you want

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.410 
so you can see that line where you want
to<00:02:48.579> cut<00:02:48.730> next<00:02:49.030> time<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:50.049> reason<00:02:50.349> for<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.560> is

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
to cut next time the reason for that is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.630 
to cut next time the reason for that is
if<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.659> miss<00:02:52.840> spots<00:02:53.170> like<00:02:53.469> this<00:02:53.680> right<00:02:54.370> over

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
if you miss spots like this right over

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.240 
if you miss spots like this right over
here<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:56.170> leave<00:02:56.349> those<00:02:56.469> scripts<00:02:56.829> right<00:02:57.010> there

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
here you leave those scripts right there

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.699 
here you leave those scripts right there
and<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.030> end<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.390> takes<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.870> lot<00:02:59.290> more<00:02:59.469> time

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
and in the end it takes a lot more time

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:14.220 
and in the end it takes a lot more time
to<00:02:59.859> have<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.069> go<00:03:00.189> back<00:03:00.219> and<00:03:00.549> cut<00:03:00.760> all<00:03:00.879> those<00:03:01.030> out

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.570 

okay<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.290> here<00:03:15.530> we<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.650> we<00:03:15.860> have<00:03:15.890> all<00:03:16.459> the
