00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
 personal video again 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.990
 For you guys and today's video is a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.939
 somewhat different texture 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.920
 You see here, spock what it is. 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.760
 This is a texture one by one. 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 close guys it's just an image with the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 pixel here 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.629
 nothing is nothing but I always swallow 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 textures for you 16 by 16 32 by 32 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.020
 or 64 and so on. 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.610
 here a year ago for possession brought more 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.789
 heavy that I said was heavier 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.129
 change to 1,024 then this is a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.399
 ballet is a very very new texture 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.500
 but it does not have so many details of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 people and from today we will go 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.829
 start a series of cock here in the channel 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.570
 you will post here in the comments 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.229
 this texture deserves a loaf of bread or if it will 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.119
 deserves a right legendary so I can 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 here in the comments if it deserves a 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.090
 bread or the legendary and japan crowd 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 leaving that there and here of that one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250

 Let's see here how you can see us 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 your coal blocks is a block all 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.360
 Black is right is not an ore and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 coal 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.810
 Can not you see what's looking here? Let's see. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.540
 which is expected and will be different there 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.560
 attack where the iron such is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.340
 different is different, understanding 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.299

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 wait here in full the little blocks have 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.340
 a certain difference is difficult to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.670
 difficult then why are you going? 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.010
 barn your house will look alike 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.609
 This looks only from far away. 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.319

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.480
 transparency right here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.180
 you could have put it in the glass 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.609

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.329
 worse 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:17.479

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.449
 but for you who just kind of played 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.259
 running here we'll see I 'm in this 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:36.590
 moment is filming there I'm at 400 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:41.060
 fps using this texture is right 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.250
 then good you go there to help your neighbor 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.290
 A good hot can handle this 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.319
 here you are going to take a 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.180
 vantagenzinha andc relation to fps as 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.489
 locked start is right 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.560
 and here we have our rooms 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.009
 galley that does not have so much difference of the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.259
 another is just white then is 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:03.979
 next you bet on the comments 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:07.159
 this texture deserves the bread that is if she 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:09.259
 deserves a legendary is right and hence 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.229
 How's the poop going to get the kind of guy? 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:13.969
 Some people write because they are in the 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:16.159
 Next video I'm going to put some 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.289
 people here showing this person the 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:21.139
 So legendary is this person who 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.599
 occupy because of this in tau texture 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.490
 tau tau tau is sure the name of the texture is 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.400
 a man would craft then 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.650
 a year ago a type a pixel is right 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.120
 So that 's it folks said lacked 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.250
 here the video I hope you have 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.349
