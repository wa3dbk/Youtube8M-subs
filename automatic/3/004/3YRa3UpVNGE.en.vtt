earth the earth probably sees plastic is

just another one of its children could

just another one of its children could

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
be the only reason the earth allowed us

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
to be spawned from it in the first place

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.589 
to be spawned from it in the first place
it<00:05:21.150> wanted<00:05:21.479> plastic<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.289> itself<00:05:23.510> didn't<00:05:24.510> know

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
it wanted plastic for itself didn't know

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.980 
it wanted plastic for itself didn't know
how<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.840> make<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.349> needed<00:05:25.949> us<00:05:26.690> could<00:05:27.690> be<00:05:27.840> the

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
how to make it needed us could be the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.110 
how to make it needed us could be the
answer<00:05:28.409> to<00:05:28.440> our<00:05:28.590> age-old<00:05:29.159> philosophical

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
answer to our age-old philosophical

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:39.219 
answer to our age-old philosophical
question<00:05:30.539> why<00:05:30.870> are<00:05:30.900> we<00:05:31.530> here<00:05:32.599> last<00:05:33.599> day

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.580 

so<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:41.400> plastic<00:05:42.030> is<00:05:42.150> here<00:05:42.539> our<00:05:42.750> job<00:05:43.199> is<00:05:43.409> done

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
so the plastic is here our job is done

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.800 
so the plastic is here our job is done
we<00:05:43.889> can<00:05:43.919> be<00:05:44.190> phased<00:05:44.520> out<00:05:45.000> now<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.659> I<00:05:45.750> think

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
we can be phased out now and I think

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.360 
we can be phased out now and I think
that's<00:05:45.990> really<00:05:46.199> started<00:05:46.770> already<00:05:47.009> don't<00:05:47.280> you

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
that's really started already don't you

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.369 
that's really started already don't you
I<00:05:47.580> mean<00:05:47.849> to<00:05:47.940> be<00:05:47.970> fair<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.539> planet<00:05:48.930> probably

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
I mean to be fair the planet probably

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.920 
I mean to be fair the planet probably
sees<00:05:49.590> us<00:05:49.830> as<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.039> mild<00:05:50.400> threat<00:05:50.849> something<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.810> be

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
sees us as a mild threat something to be

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.809 
sees us as a mild threat something to be
dealt<00:05:52.199> with<00:05:52.470> then<00:05:52.919> I'm<00:05:53.009> sure<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.310> planet<00:05:53.669> will

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
dealt with then I'm sure the planet will

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.960 
dealt with then I'm sure the planet will
defend<00:05:54.300> itself<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.680> manner<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.699> large

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
defend itself in the manner of a large

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.700 
defend itself in the manner of a large
organism<00:05:57.389> like<00:05:57.659> a<00:05:57.720> beehive<00:05:57.960> or<00:05:58.169> an<00:05:58.349> ant<00:05:58.530> colony

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
organism like a beehive or an ant colony

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.890 
organism like a beehive or an ant colony
can<00:05:59.099> muster<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> defense<00:05:59.970> i'm<00:06:00.180> sure<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.539> planet

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
can muster a defense i'm sure the planet

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.300 
can muster a defense i'm sure the planet
