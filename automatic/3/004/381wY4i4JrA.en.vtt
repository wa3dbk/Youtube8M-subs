hey guys it's phil from
smilinggardener.com<00:00:09.160> and<00:00:10.160> i'm<00:00:10.610> sitting<00:00:10.880> here

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
smilinggardener.com and i'm sitting here

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.660 
smilinggardener.com and i'm sitting here
in<00:00:11.270> front<00:00:11.300> of<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:11.780> veggie<00:00:12.410> garden<00:00:12.740> and<00:00:13.010> today

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
in front of the veggie garden and today

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.379 
in front of the veggie garden and today
i'm<00:00:13.790> going<00:00:13.880> to<00:00:13.940> be<00:00:14.000> talking<00:00:14.330> about

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
i'm going to be talking about

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.750 
i'm going to be talking about
mycorrhizal<00:00:15.110> inoculant<00:00:15.980> i'm<00:00:16.340> sitting<00:00:16.610> real

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
mycorrhizal inoculant i'm sitting real

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.790 
mycorrhizal inoculant i'm sitting real
close<00:00:16.820> here<00:00:17.300> because<00:00:17.600> as<00:00:18.050> you'll<00:00:18.440> see<00:00:18.620> in<00:00:18.740> a

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
close here because as you'll see in a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.100 
close here because as you'll see in a
minute<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.190> inoculant<00:00:19.550> is<00:00:19.760> very<00:00:20.000> small<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:20.810> i

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
minute the inoculant is very small and i

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.380 
minute the inoculant is very small and i
want<00:00:21.950> to<00:00:22.039> show<00:00:22.190> you<00:00:22.250> exactly<00:00:22.490> how<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.000> works

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
want to show you exactly how it works

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.190 
want to show you exactly how it works
so<00:00:23.870> mycorrhizal<00:00:24.770> fungi<00:00:25.280> are<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.520> special<00:00:26.200> kind

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
so mycorrhizal fungi are a special kind

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.560 
so mycorrhizal fungi are a special kind
of<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.380> special<00:00:27.710> kind<00:00:28.400> of<00:00:28.520> fungi<00:00:28.880> that<00:00:28.910> form<00:00:29.420> a

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
of a special kind of fungi that form a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.960 
of a special kind of fungi that form a
relationship<00:00:29.990> with<00:00:30.170> plants<00:00:31.100> a<00:00:31.280> symbiotic

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
relationship with plants a symbiotic

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.369 
relationship with plants a symbiotic
relationship<00:00:32.180> where<00:00:32.870> they<00:00:32.960> help<00:00:33.140> each<00:00:33.230> other

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
relationship where they help each other

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.910 
relationship where they help each other
out<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.890> actually<00:00:34.460> over<00:00:34.730> 95%<00:00:35.300> of<00:00:35.719> plants<00:00:36.110> form

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
out and actually over 95% of plants form

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.009 
out and actually over 95% of plants form
this<00:00:37.070> relationship<00:00:37.610> with<00:00:37.940> fungi<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.899> what

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
this relationship with fungi and what

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.020 
this relationship with fungi and what
happens<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> fungi<00:00:39.949> they<00:00:40.579> effectively

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
happens is the fungi they effectively

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.060 
happens is the fungi they effectively
what<00:00:41.269> they<00:00:41.390> do<00:00:41.449> is<00:00:41.629> they<00:00:41.780> attach<00:00:42.499> to<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.920> root

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
what they do is they attach to the root

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.610 
what they do is they attach to the root
system<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.609> plants<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:44.960> even<00:00:45.230> go<00:00:45.409> right

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
system of the plants and even go right

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.020 
system of the plants and even go right
inside<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:46.129> roots<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.640> then<00:00:46.850> they

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
inside the roots and then they

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.119 
inside the roots and then they
effectively<00:00:47.420> extend<00:00:47.929> that<00:00:48.409> root<00:00:48.620> system<00:00:49.039> of

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
effectively extend that root system of

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.560 
effectively extend that root system of
the<00:00:49.190> plant<00:00:49.460> because<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.699> fungi<00:00:50.059> can<00:00:50.120> go<00:00:50.329> much

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
the plant because the fungi can go much

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.950 
the plant because the fungi can go much
further<00:00:50.870> into<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.379> soil<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.519> get<00:00:52.819> water<00:00:53.569> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
further into the soil and get water and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.799 
further into the soil and get water and
nutrients<00:00:54.679> nitrogen<00:00:55.179> especially<00:00:56.179> phosphorus

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
nutrients nitrogen especially phosphorus

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.840 
nutrients nitrogen especially phosphorus
and<00:00:56.989> some<00:00:57.109> of<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.260> heavier<00:00:57.699> some<00:00:58.699> of<00:00:58.789> the

and some of the heavier some of the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.849 
and some of the heavier some of the
nutrients<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.140> roots<00:01:00.379> have<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.649> hard

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
nutrients that the roots have a hard

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.520 
nutrients that the roots have a hard
time<00:01:00.979> getting<00:01:01.370> out<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.789> soil<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.530> in

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
time getting out of the soil and in

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.830 
time getting out of the soil and in
return<00:01:04.040> for<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.400> favor<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.269> plants<00:01:05.600> will

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
return for that favor the plants will

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.320 
return for that favor the plants will
give<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.920> lot<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.370> carbohydrates<00:01:08.120> or<00:01:08.300> sugars

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
give a lot of carbohydrates or sugars

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.810 
give a lot of carbohydrates or sugars
and<00:01:09.080> vitamins<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.800> enzymes<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.430> all<00:01:10.490> kinds

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
and vitamins and enzymes and all kinds

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.440 
and vitamins and enzymes and all kinds
of<00:01:10.909> living<00:01:11.810> substances<00:01:12.530> food<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.090> fungi

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
of living substances food to the fungi

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.569 
of living substances food to the fungi
so<00:01:15.200> it's<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.500> exchange<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.070> occurs<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
so it's this exchange that occurs and

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.520 
so it's this exchange that occurs and
plants<00:01:16.850> will<00:01:16.939> give<00:01:17.090> over<00:01:17.390> 50%<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.290> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
plants will give over 50% of the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.530 
plants will give over 50% of the
carbohydrates<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.490> they<00:01:19.610> make<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
carbohydrates that they make to the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.660 
carbohydrates that they make to the
fungi<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.320> other<00:01:21.469> microorganisms<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
fungi and to other microorganisms that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.770 
fungi and to other microorganisms that
do<00:01:23.090> things<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:23.689> them<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:23.990> soil<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.780> you

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
do things for them in the soil so you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870 
do things for them in the soil so you
know<00:01:27.009> mycorrhizal<00:01:28.009> fungi<00:01:28.430> they're<00:01:28.640> another

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
know mycorrhizal fungi they're another

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.490 
know mycorrhizal fungi they're another
of<00:01:29.119> these<00:01:29.479> microbes<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.200> talked<00:01:30.469> about

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
of these microbes that I talked about

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.440 
of these microbes that I talked about
that<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:31.039> should<00:01:31.310> have<00:01:31.520> in<00:01:31.670> our<00:01:31.759> soil<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.299> mean

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
that we should have in our soil I mean

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
that we should have in our soil I mean
they're<00:01:32.630> fairly<00:01:33.469> ubiquitous<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.340> nature<00:01:34.399> but

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
they're fairly ubiquitous in nature but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.730 
they're fairly ubiquitous in nature but
in<00:01:35.359> our<00:01:35.509> soil<00:01:35.840> they're<00:01:36.020> often<00:01:36.380> not<00:01:36.530> there

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
in our soil they're often not there

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.279 
in our soil they're often not there
because<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.189> if<00:01:37.490> we've<00:01:37.670> been<00:01:37.850> tilling<00:01:38.359> if<00:01:39.140> our

because we if we've been tilling if our

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.429 
because we if we've been tilling if our

you<00:01:56.750> know<00:01:56.869> can<00:01:57.200> drastically<00:01:58.039> decrease<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
you know can drastically decrease the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.480 
you know can drastically decrease the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
fungi in our soil and so it's a good

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.550 
fungi in our soil and so it's a good
idea<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:04.009> bring<00:02:04.249> it<00:02:04.369> back<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:05.380> there<00:02:06.380> are<00:02:06.499> a

idea to bring it back in there are a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.020 
idea to bring it back in there are a
couple<00:02:06.740> different<00:02:07.100> kinds<00:02:07.249> there's<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.850> main

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
couple different kinds there's the main

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.389 
couple different kinds there's the main
kind<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.509> called<00:02:08.720> endo<00:02:09.289> mycorrhizal<00:02:09.860> fungi

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
kind is called endo mycorrhizal fungi

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.009 
kind is called endo mycorrhizal fungi
it's<00:02:11.360> or<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.660> also<00:02:11.780> called<00:02:11.950> our<00:02:12.950> bus<00:02:13.250> killer

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019

it's or it's also called our bus killer
mycorrhizal<00:02:15.019> fungi<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:16.310> over<00:02:16.700> over<00:02:17.090> 90%

with this
and<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.569> fungi<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:21.950> going<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.280> your

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
and a fungi so that's going to be your

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.580 
and a fungi so that's going to be your
most<00:02:22.879> your<00:02:23.150> vegetables<00:02:23.659> and<00:02:23.870> your<00:02:23.959> grasses

and a lot of trees are going to form
that<00:02:25.940> relationship<00:02:26.090> there's<00:02:26.989> also<00:02:27.080> another

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
that relationship there's also another

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.369 
that relationship there's also another
one<00:02:27.530> called<00:02:27.739> ecto<00:02:28.220> mycorrhizal<00:02:28.730> fungi<00:02:29.379> the

one called ecto mycorrhizal fungi the

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.920 
one called ecto mycorrhizal fungi the
endo<00:02:30.830> actually<00:02:31.400> goes<00:02:31.580> right<00:02:31.849> inside<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.629> only

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
endo actually goes right inside not only

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.479 
endo actually goes right inside not only
inside<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.230> plant<00:02:33.560> roots<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:33.980> inside<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
cells of the plant whereas the ecto

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.600 
cells of the plant whereas the ecto
doesn't<00:02:36.349> go<00:02:36.440> inside<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.950> cells<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.430> that's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
doesn't go inside the cells or that's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.280 
doesn't go inside the cells or that's
what<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.879> that's<00:02:38.090> what<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.450> remember<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:38.840> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
what I that's what I remember about it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.610 
what I that's what I remember about it
the<00:02:39.739> ecto<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.190> about<00:02:40.430> maybe<00:02:41.120> maybe<00:02:41.629> 5%<00:02:42.530> of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the ecto is about maybe maybe 5% of

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.610 
the ecto is about maybe maybe 5% of
plants<00:02:43.010> quite<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.849> few<00:02:44.180> coniferous<00:02:45.140> trees

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
plants quite a few coniferous trees

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
plants quite a few coniferous trees
evergreen<00:02:46.250> trees<00:02:46.579> and<00:02:46.940> some<00:02:47.120> deciduous<00:02:47.540> trees

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
evergreen trees and some deciduous trees

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.520 
evergreen trees and some deciduous trees
as<00:02:47.959> well<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:48.739> what<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> often<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.849> do<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.530> if

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
as well so what I often like to do is if

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.350 
as well so what I often like to do is if
I'm<00:02:51.739> going<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> be<00:02:52.040> seeding<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> big<00:02:53.030> lawn

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
I'm going to be seeding like a big lawn

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.050 
I'm going to be seeding like a big lawn
area<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.110> might<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.620> go<00:02:54.769> for<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.129> endo<00:02:55.519> but<00:02:55.970> if

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
area I might just go for the endo but if

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.610 
area I might just go for the endo but if
I'm<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.360> be<00:02:56.420> seeding<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.959> lawn<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
I'm going to be seeding a lawn and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.740 
I'm going to be seeding a lawn and
vegetables<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.340> trees<00:02:58.519> I'll<00:02:59.060> pay<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.510> extra

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
vegetables and trees I'll pay the extra

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.809 
vegetables and trees I'll pay the extra
well<00:03:00.560> when<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.769> sold<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.280> stuff<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.579> was<00:03:01.670> about

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
well when I sold this stuff it was about

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.539 
well when I sold this stuff it was about
an<00:03:01.940> extra<00:03:02.180> 10%<00:03:02.390> for<00:03:02.959> an<00:03:03.019> endo<00:03:03.319> ecto<00:03:03.620> blend<00:03:03.920> so

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
an extra 10% for an endo ecto blend so

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.800 
an extra 10% for an endo ecto blend so
that's<00:03:04.700> what<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:04.849> usually<00:03:05.000> recommend<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.660> go

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that's what I usually recommend you go

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.390 
that's what I usually recommend you go
with<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.599> get<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:10.010> know<00:03:10.129> from

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
with and you can get that you know from

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.550 
with and you can get that you know from
like<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.269> organic<00:03:11.510> gardeners<00:03:11.959> pantry<00:03:12.379> which

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
like the organic gardeners pantry which

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.069 
like the organic gardeners pantry which
I<00:03:12.680> used<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.040> run<00:03:13.190> that's<00:03:13.549> just<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.910> Canada<00:03:14.090> in

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
I used to run that's just in Canada in

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.960 
I used to run that's just in Canada in
the<00:03:15.260> US<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.709> actually<00:03:15.859> found<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.340> good<00:03:16.430> brand<00:03:16.670> on

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
the US I actually found a good brand on

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.000 
the US I actually found a good brand on
Amazon<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.290> know<00:03:18.319> it's<00:03:18.560> starting<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.890> become

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
Amazon you know it's starting to become

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.220 
Amazon you know it's starting to become
a<00:03:19.340> bigger<00:03:19.609> thing<00:03:19.849> now<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.660> been<00:03:20.780> around<00:03:20.989> for

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
a bigger thing now it's been around for

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.300 
a bigger thing now it's been around for
a<00:03:21.260> while<00:03:21.319> but<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.739> starting<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.069> become<00:03:22.190> more

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
a while but it's starting to become more

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.740 
a while but it's starting to become more
well<00:03:22.640> known<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.090> should<00:03:23.329> be<00:03:23.420> able<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.569> find

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
well known so you should be able to find

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.220 
well known so you should be able to find
it<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.200> garden<00:03:24.530> center<00:03:24.829> too<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.079> you

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
it in a garden center too so when you

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.050 
it in a garden center too so when you
want<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.470> apply<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:28.220> know<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.430> ideal<00:03:28.790> time

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
want to apply it you know the ideal time

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.909 
want to apply it you know the ideal time
to<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.359> this<00:03:29.480> stuff<00:03:29.660> applied<00:03:29.959> is<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.799> the

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
to have this stuff applied is in the

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.319 
to have this stuff applied is in the
nursery<00:03:31.280> when<00:03:31.489> they<00:03:31.639> grow<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.180> that's

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
nursery when they grow it but that's

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.180 
nursery when they grow it but that's
often<00:03:32.900> not<00:03:33.319> happening

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
often not happening

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.039 
often not happening
usually<00:03:34.880> not<00:03:35.000> happening<00:03:35.419> it's<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.780> starting

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.750 
usually not happening it's it's starting
to<00:03:36.139> happen<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.410> little<00:03:36.530> more<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:36.980> generally

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
to happen a little more but generally

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.979 
to happen a little more but generally
we're<00:03:37.880> going<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.419> ourselves

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
we're going to have to do it ourselves

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.039 
we're going to have to do it ourselves
and<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.410> best<00:03:39.560> time<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.859> do<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.280> when<00:03:40.609> you

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
and the best time to do that is when you

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.080 
and the best time to do that is when you
when<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.139> plant<00:03:42.410> because<00:03:43.069> you<00:03:43.519> want<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.819> to

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
when you plant because you want this to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.190 
when you plant because you want this to
form<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.510> want<00:03:44.599> this<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.079> contact

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
form you want this to get in contact

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.460 
form you want this to get in contact
with<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.980> roots<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.489> plant<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
with the roots of the plant and so the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.420 
with the roots of the plant and so the
best<00:03:48.620> time<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.190> when<00:03:49.310> you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
best time to do that is when you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.430 
best time to do that is when you
actually<00:03:49.549> have<00:03:49.819> access<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.419> roots<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:51.109> I'm

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
actually have access to the roots so I'm

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.750 
actually have access to the roots so I'm
going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> show<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.829> today<00:03:52.160> just<00:03:52.190> how<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.519> would

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
do it with seeds because seeds need it

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.069

the fungi with so here are some beans

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.740 
the fungi with so here are some beans
I<00:04:34.370> picked<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.700> bean<00:04:34.880> just<00:04:35.060> because<00:04:35.270> it's<00:04:35.420> big

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
I picked a bean just because it's big

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.520 
I picked a bean just because it's big
enough<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.020> me<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.650> show<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:38.380> here<00:04:39.380> is

enough for me to show you and here is
some<00:04:42.490> micro<00:04:43.490> eyes'll<00:04:43.880> fungi<00:04:44.180> powder<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.720> have

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
some micro eyes'll fungi powder I have

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.030 
some micro eyes'll fungi powder I have
it<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.200> powder<00:04:45.410> form

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
it in a powder form

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.340 
it in a powder form
I<00:04:46.070> always<00:04:46.640> tended<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.300> just<00:04:47.810> sold<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.140> powder

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
I always tended I just sold the powder

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.990 
I always tended I just sold the powder
form<00:04:48.650> because<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.160> goes<00:04:49.340> through<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.640> sprayer

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
form because it goes through a sprayer

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.580 
form because it goes through a sprayer
as<00:04:50.270> well<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.660> sometimes<00:04:50.810> it's<00:04:51.080> useful<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.440> put

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
as well and sometimes it's useful to put

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.890 
as well and sometimes it's useful to put
it<00:04:51.680> through<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.860> sprayer<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.480> also<00:04:53.600> get<00:04:53.780> it

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
it through a sprayer you can also get it

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.140 
it through a sprayer you can also get it
more<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.170> a<00:04:54.230> granule<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.860> like<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.700> powder<00:04:55.880> and

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
more of a granule I like the powder and

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.790 
more of a granule I like the powder and
then<00:04:56.240> it's<00:04:56.390> really<00:04:56.630> it's<00:04:57.170> helpful<00:04:57.470> because<00:04:57.680> a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
then it's really it's helpful because a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.340 
then it's really it's helpful because a
powder<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.220> can<00:04:58.450> rub<00:04:59.450> right<00:04:59.690> onto<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.140> plant

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
powder you can rub right onto the plant

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.680 
powder you can rub right onto the plant
roots<00:05:00.620> or<00:05:01.010> rub<00:05:01.190> onto<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> seeds<00:05:01.850> so<00:05:02.480> all<00:05:02.660> I

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
roots or rub onto the seeds so all I

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.840 
roots or rub onto the seeds so all I
would<00:05:02.870> do<00:05:03.140> is<00:05:03.350> if<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.800> would<00:05:04.010> follow<00:05:04.670> the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
would do is if I would follow the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.010 
would do is if I would follow the
instructions<00:05:05.300> for<00:05:05.450> how<00:05:05.510> much<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.780> need<00:05:05.930> to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
instructions for how much you need to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.080 
instructions for how much you need to
use<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.380> depends<00:05:06.680> on<00:05:06.770> which<00:05:06.890> kind<00:05:07.070> you<00:05:07.250> buy<00:05:07.400> but

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
use it depends on which kind you buy but

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.940 
use it depends on which kind you buy but
I<00:05:08.120> would<00:05:08.570> take<00:05:08.720> my<00:05:08.900> all<00:05:09.080> my<00:05:09.110> seeds<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:09.830> would

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
I would take my all my seeds and I would

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.380 
I would take my all my seeds and I would
just<00:05:10.040> have<00:05:10.370> them<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.670> jar<00:05:10.850> or<00:05:10.880> something<00:05:11.270> and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
just have them in a jar or something and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.000 
just have them in a jar or something and
I<00:05:11.420> would<00:05:11.480> just<00:05:11.690> rub<00:05:12.020> them<00:05:12.170> onto<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.530> fungi<00:05:12.830> all

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
I would just rub them onto the fungi all

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.320 
I would just rub them onto the fungi all
you<00:05:13.130> need<00:05:13.250> is<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.370> little<00:05:13.580> bit<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.850> fungi<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.150> get

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
you need is a little bit of fungi to get

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.600 
you need is a little bit of fungi to get
on<00:05:14.420> there<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.320> don't<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.980> can<00:05:16.160> see<00:05:16.400> that

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
on there and I don't you can see that

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.790 
on there and I don't you can see that
yeah<00:05:16.850> you<00:05:16.910> can<00:05:17.150> see<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:17.510> that's<00:05:18.170> coated<00:05:18.500> I

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
yeah you can see that that's coated I

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.290 
yeah you can see that that's coated I
mean<00:05:18.950> that's<00:05:19.070> plenty<00:05:19.340> all<00:05:19.850> you<00:05:20.030> need<00:05:20.180> is<00:05:20.270> a

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
mean that's plenty all you need is a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.890 
mean that's plenty all you need is a
little<00:05:20.600> bit<00:05:22.090> another<00:05:23.090> thing<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:23.450> I<00:05:23.480> would<00:05:23.600> do

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
little bit another thing that I would do

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.480 
little bit another thing that I would do
though<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.470> tend<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.770> soak<00:05:25.010> my<00:05:25.220> seeds

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
though is I tend to soak my seeds

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.430 
though is I tend to soak my seeds
overnight<00:05:25.970> before<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.330> plant<00:05:26.570> them<00:05:26.750> not<00:05:27.260> so

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
overnight before I plant them not so

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.470 
overnight before I plant them not so
much<00:05:27.620> bean<00:05:27.830> seeds<00:05:28.160> legumes<00:05:28.430> I've<00:05:29.270> learned

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
much bean seeds legumes I've learned

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.460 
much bean seeds legumes I've learned
that<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.720> don't<00:05:29.840> really<00:05:29.960> want<00:05:30.140> to<00:05:30.200> soak<00:05:30.320> them

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
that you don't really want to soak them

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.560 
that you don't really want to soak them
for<00:05:30.590> too<00:05:30.740> long<00:05:30.950> but<00:05:31.160> most<00:05:31.340> seeds<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.730> do<00:05:31.790> soak

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
for too long but most seeds I do soak

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.200 
for too long but most seeds I do soak
them<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:32.990> mixture<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.290> kelp<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.040> water<00:05:34.850> and

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
them in a mixture of kelp and water and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.730 
them in a mixture of kelp and water and
usually<00:05:35.360> sea<00:05:35.810> minerals<00:05:36.020> I'll<00:05:36.530> talk<00:05:36.710> about

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
usually sea minerals I'll talk about

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.190 
usually sea minerals I'll talk about
that<00:05:37.010> another<00:05:37.280> time<00:05:37.370> but<00:05:38.240> here<00:05:38.510> are<00:05:38.660> some<00:05:38.690> that

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
that another time but here are some that

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.610 
that another time but here are some that
I<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.650> just<00:05:40.040> soaked<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.300> put<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.170> there

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
I I just soaked and I put that in there

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.700 
I I just soaked and I put that in there
Oh<00:05:43.330> like<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.600> really<00:05:45.020> sticks<00:05:45.260> really<00:05:45.530> nicely

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
Oh like it really sticks really nicely

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.010 
Oh like it really sticks really nicely
so<00:05:46.040> usually<00:05:46.940> I'm<00:05:47.060> I'm<00:05:47.600> putting<00:05:47.960> my

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
so usually I'm I'm putting my

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.690 
so usually I'm I'm putting my
mycorrhizae<00:05:48.410> fungi<00:05:48.860> on<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.280> something<00:05:49.580> that's

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
mycorrhizae fungi on to something that's

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.120 
mycorrhizae fungi on to something that's
been<00:05:49.910> soaked<00:05:50.740> I<00:05:52.570> don't<00:05:53.570> have<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:54.440> don't<00:05:54.890> have

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
been soaked I don't have a I don't have

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.380 
been soaked I don't have a I don't have
a<00:05:55.160> plant<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.550> show<00:05:55.700> you<00:05:55.760> today<00:05:56.030> because<00:05:56.150> it's

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
a plant to show you today because it's

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
a plant to show you today because it's
the<00:05:56.450> middle<00:05:56.570> of<00:05:56.780> summer<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.140> that's<00:05:57.290> the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
the middle of summer and that's the

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
the middle of summer and that's the
other<00:05:57.500> reason<00:05:57.590> I'm<00:05:57.890> not<00:05:57.920> going<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.250> show<00:05:58.340> you

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
other reason I'm not going to show you

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.250 
other reason I'm not going to show you
how<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.550> plant<00:05:58.790> it<00:05:58.940> but<00:05:59.360> if<00:05:59.450> I<00:05:59.540> did<00:05:59.720> if<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.080> had

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
how to plant it but if I did if I had

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.840 
how to plant it but if I did if I had
say<00:06:00.500> a<00:06:00.530> little<00:06:00.860> basil<00:06:01.040> or<00:06:01.340> something<00:06:01.640> I<00:06:01.730> would

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
say a little basil or something I would

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.430 
say a little basil or something I would
take<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.090> out<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.240> its<00:06:02.360> pot<00:06:02.600> and<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.140> would<00:06:03.290> just

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
take it out of its pot and I would just

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.010 
take it out of its pot and I would just
rub<00:06:03.940> like<00:06:04.940> half<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.330> teaspoon<00:06:05.720> of<00:06:05.840> this<00:06:05.960> stuff

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
rub like half a teaspoon of this stuff

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.140 
rub like half a teaspoon of this stuff
onto<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:06.920> roots<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.430> don't<00:06:07.700> have<00:06:07.790> to<00:06:07.850> cover<00:06:08.000> the

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
onto the roots I don't have to cover the

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.490 
onto the roots I don't have to cover the
whole<00:06:08.270> roots<00:06:08.540> just<00:06:08.780> as<00:06:08.930> long<00:06:09.080> as<00:06:09.170> it<00:06:09.260> gets<00:06:09.320> on<00:06:09.470> a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
whole roots just as long as it gets on a

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.290 
whole roots just as long as it gets on a
little<00:06:09.770> bit<00:06:09.920> of<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.070> root<00:06:10.250> there<00:06:11.150> are

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
little bit of the root there are

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.650 
little bit of the root there are
hundreds<00:06:12.080> of<00:06:12.140> thousands<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.590> spores<00:06:13.270> you<00:06:14.270> know

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
hundreds of thousands of spores you know

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.900 
hundreds of thousands of spores you know
in<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.870> in<00:06:15.170> a<00:06:15.350> pound<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:15.770> this<00:06:15.860> this<00:06:16.490> stuff<00:06:16.700> so

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
in a in a pound of this this stuff so

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.940 
in a in a pound of this this stuff so
like<00:06:17.060> I'm<00:06:17.660> going<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:17.870> have<00:06:17.990> thousands<00:06:18.620> of<00:06:18.740> or

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
like I'm going to have thousands of or

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.070 
like I'm going to have thousands of or
hundreds<00:06:19.340> or<00:06:19.430> thousands<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.210> spores<00:06:20.450> here<00:06:20.930> and

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
hundreds or thousands of spores here and

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.270 
hundreds or thousands of spores here and
just<00:06:21.200> rub<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.470> on<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:21.710> root<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.010> you're

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
just rub that on the root and you're

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.590 
just rub that on the root and you're
good<00:06:22.430> to<00:06:22.520> go

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
good to go

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.260 
good to go
I<00:06:24.490> think<00:06:25.490> that's<00:06:25.640> all<00:06:25.760> I<00:06:25.820> want<00:06:26.000> to<00:06:26.060> talk<00:06:26.150> about

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
I think that's all I want to talk about

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.480 
I think that's all I want to talk about
today<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:26.930> kind<00:06:27.650> of<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:27.950> know<00:06:28.010> I'm<00:06:28.220> going<00:06:28.310> to<00:06:28.400> get

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
today I kind of I know I'm going to get

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.520 
today I kind of I know I'm going to get
a<00:06:28.520> lot<00:06:28.670> more<00:06:28.700> into<00:06:29.180> this<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.570> the<00:06:29.930> Academy<00:06:30.380> when

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
a lot more into this in the Academy when

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.500 
a lot more into this in the Academy when
I<00:06:30.560> get<00:06:30.830> when<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:30.980> have<00:06:31.130> more<00:06:31.310> time<00:06:31.460> but<00:06:31.760> uh<00:06:32.000> I

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
I get when I have more time but uh I

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.390 
I get when I have more time but uh I
think<00:06:33.410> that's<00:06:33.620> good<00:06:33.800> for<00:06:33.830> now

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
think that's good for now
