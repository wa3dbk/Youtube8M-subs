00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 I 'm stuck here almost ready and I'm going 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.780
 show you how to paint the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.619
 we already paint tomatoes we already 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.400
 we tried leaf here are the radish 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.949
 just go in as little as you can to let the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.740
 his tail with a little more light 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 and gives better known had with wine alone 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.790
 this the radish does not have any problem 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 as well as taken 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 then the flower 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.170
 she has everything from gomme right 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.750
 are wines of flowers 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.750
 so we'll put ocher yellow 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.039
 on her return and we'll give a little 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 a little bit of yellow marcelo ocher a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.439
 little green 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:18.140
 we are alternating a little bit of 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.140
 green only the outline of it 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.329
 follows 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.650
 no pib in heaven with nothing 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.650
 we are putting together 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.920
 a clean day in the brush and I come 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:28.950
 bringing a little more to center 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:31.500
 here was a little here and there 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.719
 bringing a little more to the center 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.719
 just to give a dirty one 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.060
 here was champion 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.349
 We are going to work the cauliflower in two 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.299
 times 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.830
 I'll get the white now so I go 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.720
 do the first time 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.870
 we'll let it dry later, and then 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.900
 do it again with the white I go 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.900
 fill white with ink and I've been beating 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.930
 letting a little of the color appear 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.379
 I already put it was the yellow ocher 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:29.299
 It's the green that's supposed to stay and it's not a 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:34.060
 smooth painting is a one curl painting 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.060
 Then I hit the brush 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:53.099
 and I'm following the format of it she goes 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.930
 dry the fabric will suck paint goes 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.720
 become very transparent 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.620
 so that's why I'll be back later 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:12.260
 doing the same thing and it 's tapping 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.260
 It even picks up ink and goes knocking. 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.530
 and so I'll do 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:38.550
 in it all remembering after it has dried 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.610
 Do the same thing always 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:51.840
 letting a little of the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:54.870
 yellow ocher and green after the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 dry the second coat of paint 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.560
 she's going to get all that spine she 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.460
 it will not get that paint plating 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.990
 smooth as here this utensil begins to 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 leaf like this 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.080
 this radish 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:19.650
 She's going to stay the whole spain then. 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 I wanted to enjoy it if one day you 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.190
 take a risk and have a cauliflower 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.080
 at least everyone knows how to paint and 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:41.300
 knows it's the simplest thing in the world 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:41.300
 everything is easy it's all batidinho 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.400
 then now I have to wait to dry 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.420
 to give some more brushstrokes 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.030
 I do not have more here for now 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:06.830
 do 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:10.670
 I just have to wait to dry and then 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:14.330
 give a reinforced dine is a painting 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:18.350
 very pretty and very soft and looks 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.920
 really that has relief 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.920
 fine
