00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.690 

this<00:00:05.420> is<00:00:05.660> a<00:00:05.689> very<00:00:06.200> simple<00:00:06.770> circuit<00:00:07.009> to<00:00:07.310> control

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
this is a very simple circuit to control

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.039 
this is a very simple circuit to control
the<00:00:07.819> bias<00:00:08.180> which<00:00:10.000> um<00:00:11.139> how<00:00:12.139> I'm<00:00:12.969> cut<00:00:13.969> off<00:00:14.049> but

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
the bias which um how I'm cut off but

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.470 
the bias which um how I'm cut off but
sometimes<00:00:15.290> you<00:00:15.830> need<00:00:16.040> to<00:00:16.189> use<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.369> switch<00:00:16.790> which

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
sometimes you need to use a switch which

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.979 
sometimes you need to use a switch which
is<00:00:17.509> sensitive<00:00:17.990> to<00:00:18.800> temperature<00:00:19.599> to<00:00:20.599> control

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:20.989 
is sensitive to temperature to control

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.290 
is sensitive to temperature to control
the<00:00:21.079> unit<00:00:22.660> this<00:00:23.660> is<00:00:23.720> what<00:00:24.079> we<00:00:24.259> have<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:25.009> is<00:00:25.220> a

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
the unit this is what we have this is a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.799 
the unit this is what we have this is a
12<00:00:26.300> voltage<00:00:26.750> temperature<00:00:27.140> controller<00:00:28.809> now

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:29.809 
12 voltage temperature controller now

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.499 
12 voltage temperature controller now
replace<00:00:30.259> the<00:00:30.529> switch<00:00:30.849> with<00:00:31.849> this<00:00:32.029> controller

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
replace the switch with this controller

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.350 
replace the switch with this controller
in<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.140> way<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:33.380> can<00:00:33.590> understand<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.360> much

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
in this way you can understand it much

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:45.250 
in this way you can understand it much
easier<00:00:40.870> remember<00:00:43.180> there<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.270> no<00:00:44.510> output<00:00:44.750> this

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
easier remember there is no output this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:01:03.230 
easier remember there is no output this
is<00:00:45.470> just<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.950> switch

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:16.580 

this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.130> input

how<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:22.150> heat<00:04:23.150> function<00:04:24.100> works

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:42.559 

press<00:04:32.789> it<00:04:33.029> for<00:04:33.389> five<00:04:34.080> seconds

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.320 

choose<00:04:43.770> heat

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330

the<00:04:48.840> other<00:04:49.050> setting<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.830> same

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.970 

the<00:05:01.880> circumcircle<00:05:02.810> stones<00:05:03.320> temperature<00:05:03.919> is

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
the circumcircle stones temperature is

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.120 
the circumcircle stones temperature is
below<00:05:04.310> 30<00:05:05.860> degree<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:09.260> circuit<00:05:09.979> is

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
below 30 degree so the circuit is

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.480 
below 30 degree so the circuit is
powered<00:05:10.460> on

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.080 

go<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.360> pepper

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090
