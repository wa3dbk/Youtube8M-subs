00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
home and a regular blender you know if

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.099 
home and a regular blender you know if
you<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> blender<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.359> has<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.720> lower

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you have a blender that has like lower

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
you have a blender that has like lower
speed<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.070> better<00:00:29.279> work<00:00:29.490> but

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
speed that will do better work but

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
speed that will do better work but
actually<00:00:30.570> any<00:00:30.810> blender<00:00:31.260> would<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.529> good<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
actually any blender would be good so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.080 
actually any blender would be good so
it's<00:00:32.489> pretty<00:00:32.640> simple

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it's pretty simple

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's pretty simple
let's<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.110> could<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> few<00:00:34.559> ice

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
let's get to it we could take a few ice

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.180 
let's get to it we could take a few ice
cube<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.180> put<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:36.630> inside<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.079> them<00:00:40.190> again

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
cube we put them inside of them again

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.930 
cube we put them inside of them again
you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.329> want<00:00:48.710> around<00:00:49.710> half<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> tray<00:00:50.579> of

kind of a speak I have this kind of
troll<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.840> work<00:01:10.080> with

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
troll that would do a good work with

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.920 
troll that would do a good work with
that<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> lower<00:01:12.510> speed

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that and if you know the lower speed

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
that and if you know the lower speed
blender<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.470> most<00:01:13.799> likely<00:01:14.010> wouldn't<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
blender you most likely wouldn't have to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
blender you most likely wouldn't have to
do<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:17.420> blender<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:19.200> speed<00:01:19.560> most<00:01:20.280> likely

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
do that blender one speed most likely

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.980 
do that blender one speed most likely
going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> face<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> problem<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going to face that problem there's just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.880 
going to face that problem there's just
no<00:01:22.200> ice
