keep<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> memory<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.750> could

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
keep the memory the same or you could

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
keep the memory the same or you could
give<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.250> give<00:00:53.489> over<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.000> how

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
give it like to give over and see how

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.229 
give it like to give over and see how
fast<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> want<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.280> disk<00:00:56.699> size

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
fast it is if you want it also disk size

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
fast it is if you want it also disk size
and<00:00:57.719> maybe<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.469> eight<00:00:58.620> gigabytes<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and maybe an eight gigabytes because I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240 
and maybe an eight gigabytes because I
can't<00:00:59.730> give<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.359> reason

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
can't give it more for some reason

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
can't give it more for some reason
anyway<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.489> need<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> press<00:01:02.820> finish<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
anyway just need to press finish now and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.539 
anyway just need to press finish now and
call<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> an<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:08.810> case<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> takes<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
call it an right case so it takes a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
call it an right case so it takes a
while<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.729> boot<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> Linux

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
while to boot up and I use this Linux

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.039 
while to boot up and I use this Linux
whether<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.220> am<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:15.500> choose<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> resolution

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
whether we am some choose the resolution

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.149 
whether we am some choose the resolution
so<00:01:19.049> I'll<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:20.420> 1024<00:01:21.830> 720<00:01:24.470> ok<00:01:25.470> sorry

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so I'll use some 1024 720 ok sorry

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.020 
so I'll use some 1024 720 ok sorry
just<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.820> an<00:01:26.909> instant<00:01:27.720> message<00:01:31.700> ok<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
just got an instant message ok so this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
just got an instant message ok so this
is<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> Linux<00:01:33.540> kernel<00:01:34.020> over<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
is a Linux kernel over here and the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.569 
is a Linux kernel over here and the
screen<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.490> might<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:39.030> funny<00:01:40.579> then

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
screen also might go a bit funny then

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.170 
screen also might go a bit funny then
you<00:01:41.759> see<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> Android<00:01:42.780> boots<00:01:43.200> low<00:01:44.070> there

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.530 

and<00:01:49.660> also<00:01:50.260> will<00:01:50.560> say<00:01:50.830> um<00:01:51.010> these<00:01:51.970> connects

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
and also will say um these connects

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.590 
and also will say um these connects
charger<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.730> can<00:01:57.820> see<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.150> mouse<00:01:58.330> is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
charger and as you can see the mouse is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
charger and as you can see the mouse is
this<00:01:59.140> weird<00:01:59.440> triangle<00:02:00.570> desktop<00:02:01.570> also<00:02:01.750> them

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
this weird triangle desktop also them

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.130 
this weird triangle desktop also them
will<00:02:03.340> be<00:02:03.430> in<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.610> bath<00:02:03.760> resolution<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.020> it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
will be in the bath resolution so it's

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
will be in the bath resolution so it's
the<00:02:05.260> return<00:02:05.560> see<00:02:05.680> computer<00:02:06.040> press

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the return see computer press

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the return see computer press
controlling<00:02:07.420> commands<00:02:07.860> Apple<00:02:08.860> key<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:13.440> some

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
controlling commands Apple key and some

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.080 
controlling commands Apple key and some
I<00:02:14.650> think<00:02:14.830> there<00:02:15.010> isn't<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> second<00:02:15.640> page<00:02:15.820> here

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.570 

anyway<00:02:19.090> um<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.340> go<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.450> browser<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
anyway um you can go to the browser so

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.449 
anyway um you can go to the browser so
you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.880> use<00:02:25.209> some<00:02:26.100> Google<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.310> there's

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
you can use some Google and there's

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.310 
you can use some Google and there's
different<00:02:27.610> other<00:02:27.850> things<00:02:28.090> here<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.600> they'll

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
different other things here and they'll

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.930 
different other things here and they'll
automatically<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.040> mobile<00:02:30.340> version<00:02:30.820> by

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
automatically go to mobile version by

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.090 
automatically go to mobile version by
the<00:02:30.970> way<00:02:34.230> okay<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.470> think<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.740> can<00:02:35.890> type

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
the way okay so I think you can type

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.070 
the way okay so I think you can type
cost<00:02:36.550> them<00:02:37.290> we've<00:02:38.290> had<00:02:38.470> verses<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:40.080> actually

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
cost them we've had verses here actually

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.960 
cost them we've had verses here actually
it<00:02:41.290> looks<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.709> can't<00:02:41.950> but<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.160> think<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
it looks like you can't but I think this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.440 
it looks like you can't but I think this
