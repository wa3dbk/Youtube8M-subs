00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.309
 of alpine attack is called spray of the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.970
 brand or model 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.740

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.029
 sturdy waterproof fabric 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.250
 does not have pockets on the outside 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.130
 very big because they are not designed 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.689
 for water storage but for 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 the big one or piolets were from the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.920
 load rods this one also 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.230
 has a system 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.900
 of three anchors that allow you to do 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 climbing 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.670
 and be able to fix the backpack to an insurance and 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.660
 an anchor and not have to worry about 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.800
 put this as a backpack to use 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.879
 alpine has this protector 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.879
 he allows you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.009
 prohibits the passage of snow through 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.280
 over inside the backpack and this is 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.280
 something that you can remove this summer 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.050
 It is also very large in 338 liters. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 a capacity 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.140
 important has an interior pocket 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.550
 for storage of bladders very 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.800
 large up to three liters 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.360
 perfectly between one and this 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.980
 device that allows the bladder not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 go to the bottom of the backpack 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.979
 you also if the night gets complicated he 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.300
 has an internal isolation that is a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 kind of insulator to be bivouac in the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.320
 night in moments of where really not 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.790
 can be turned on by being part of the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.230
 The backpack structure can be used 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.580
 for as thermal insulation 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.110
 have the option of x 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.200
 put carabiners 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.240
 to have them on hand in case of using 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.140
 harness 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 have the possibility 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.880
 and set up so that the fanny packs do not 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.710
 bother and access to the harness is optimal 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 and it does not bother at the time of 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.980
 climbing 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770
 this allows it is that this is behind 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.050
 and the backpack already loses the fanny packs and 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.920
 automatically I am backpack of attacks 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 climbing
