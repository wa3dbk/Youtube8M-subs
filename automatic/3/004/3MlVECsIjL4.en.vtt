okay<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.030> red<00:00:12.300> stripe<00:00:12.630> time<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
okay it's red stripe time just because I

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.439 
okay it's red stripe time just because I
had<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:14.070> extra<00:00:14.190> left<00:00:14.549> over<00:00:17.210> hmm

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
had some extra left over hmm

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.800 
had some extra left over hmm
we<00:00:19.289> finished<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> lift<00:00:20.010> kit<00:00:23.630> all<00:00:24.630> right

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we finished with the lift kit all right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
we finished with the lift kit all right
here's<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.050> Jeep<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> lift<00:00:25.769> kit<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
here's the Jeep with the lift kit on it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.540 
here's the Jeep with the lift kit on it
and<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.359> wife<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.779> came<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.550> yeah

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and my wife actually came out and yeah

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479 
and my wife actually came out and yeah
helped<00:00:29.970> me<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.570> morning<00:00:31.130> basically<00:00:32.130> he<00:00:32.279> said

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
helped me this morning basically he said

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.790 
helped me this morning basically he said
hurry<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.420> finish<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:36.200> but<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.500> tell<00:00:37.680> from

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
hurry up finish it but you can tell from

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470 
hurry up finish it but you can tell from
the<00:00:37.980> lift<00:00:38.160> kit<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.550> sitting<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.270> higher

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the lift kit it is sitting a lot higher

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.040 
the lift kit it is sitting a lot higher
than<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.480> got<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> few<00:00:42.719> thoughts<00:00:42.870> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
than it was and got a few thoughts on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
than it was and got a few thoughts on
that<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> four<00:00:44.879> inch<00:00:45.030> lift

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that I think that it's a four inch lift

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.850 
that I think that it's a four inch lift
kit<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> springs<00:00:48.350> were<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.590> worn

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
kit but because the springs were so worn

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.990 
kit but because the springs were so worn
out<00:00:49.980> bent<00:00:50.399> broken<00:00:51.949> just<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.070> terrible<00:00:53.430> shape<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
out bent broken just in terrible shape I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
out bent broken just in terrible shape I
think<00:00:54.360> probably<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.280> six

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
think probably I actually got about six

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
think probably I actually got about six
inches<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.090> lift<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.460> just<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
inches of lift out of it just from that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.340 
inches of lift out of it just from that
section<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> liberally<00:01:05.640> applied<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
section so I liberally applied it to the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.140 
section so I liberally applied it to the
plate<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.659> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.960> frame<00:01:10.260> rail<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.939> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
plate and on the frame rail and this is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
plate and on the frame rail and this is
supposed<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> stop<00:01:12.900> rust<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> couldn't

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
supposed to stop rust so it couldn't

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
supposed to stop rust so it couldn't
hurt<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:18.270> looks<00:01:18.479> pretty<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
hurt right that looks pretty good and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.609 
hurt right that looks pretty good and
then<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.490> go<00:01:20.610> ahead<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> install<00:01:21.320> all<00:01:22.320> my

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
then I can go ahead and install all my

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550 
then I can go ahead and install all my
spacers<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.909> basically<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
spacers they go basically like that and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.390 
spacers they go basically like that and
drop<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.180> lower<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
drop that down and lower the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
drop that down and lower the
differential<00:01:29.400> slightly<00:01:29.780> helped<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
differential slightly helped with the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:53.140 
differential slightly helped with the
angle<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> drive<00:01:31.650> shafts

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.910 

did<00:01:54.150> my<00:01:54.330> final<00:01:54.540> measurements<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
did my final measurements right now and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.680 
did my final measurements right now and
here's<00:01:56.370> that<00:01:56.550> little<00:01:56.730> clip<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.510> first

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
here's that little clip from the first

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.380 
here's that little clip from the first
measurements<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.470> took<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.270> going

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
measurements that we took so I'm going

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.620 
measurements that we took so I'm going
to<00:02:00.450> measure<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.660> at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> front<00:02:01.230> corner

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
to measure right at the front corner

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.920 
to measure right at the front corner
looks<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:04.050> at<00:02:04.170> 29<00:02:04.620> inches<00:02:05.780> okay<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
looks like right at 29 inches okay and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.450 
looks like right at 29 inches okay and
this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.320> measurements<00:02:07.800> from<00:02:07.950> today

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
this is the measurements from today

this is the measurements from today
where<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> measure<00:02:11.240> at<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.420> front<00:02:12.720> corner<00:02:14.210> and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
where I measure at this front corner and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.720 
where I measure at this front corner and
we're<00:02:15.600> at<00:02:15.750> 34<00:02:16.500> inches<00:02:17.480> exactly<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.460> front

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
we're at 34 inches exactly at the front

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.920 
we're at 34 inches exactly at the front
corner<00:02:23.150> here's<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.209> clip<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> back

corner here's a clip from the back
measurement<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.620> did<00:02:25.770> originally<00:02:29.360> I'm

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
measurement that we did originally I'm

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.830 
measurement that we did originally I'm
just<00:02:30.510> gonna<00:02:30.660> measure<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> seam<00:02:31.470> down

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
just gonna measure from the seam down

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.250 
just gonna measure from the seam down
twenty-two<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.050> half<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.420> here's<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.990> clip

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
twenty-two and a half and here's a clip

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
twenty-two and a half and here's a clip
from<00:02:37.430> today<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.000> back<00:02:39.209> measurement<00:02:41.060> okay

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
from today in the back measurement okay

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.540 
from today in the back measurement okay
so<00:02:42.560> all<00:02:43.560> right<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:43.890> I'm<00:02:43.980> gonna<00:02:44.130> measure<00:02:44.310> from

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
so all right now I'm gonna measure from

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.979 
so all right now I'm gonna measure from
this<00:02:44.700> back<00:02:44.910> corner<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.330> you're<00:02:48.480> looking<00:02:48.840> at

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
this back corner and you're looking at

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.150 
this back corner and you're looking at
twenty<00:02:49.500> seven<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.900> quarter<00:02:52.110> twenty<00:02:52.950> seven

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
twenty seven and a quarter twenty seven

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.400 
twenty seven and a quarter twenty seven
or<00:02:53.250> quarter<00:02:53.520> roughly<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.010> looks<00:02:56.160> like<00:02:56.250> all

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
or quarter roughly so it looks like all

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.630 
or quarter roughly so it looks like all
right<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> couldn't<00:02:58.830> resist<00:02:58.920> driving<00:02:59.459> around

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
right you couldn't resist driving around

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.550 
right you couldn't resist driving around
with<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> jeep<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.450> doesn't<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
with a jeep that doesn't have a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:24.920 
with a jeep that doesn't have a
windshield<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.610> not<00:03:02.910> street-legal

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.060 

that's<00:03:25.930> Randy's<00:03:26.380> house<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:26.830> where<00:03:26.950> he

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
that's Randy's house that's where he

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.440 
that's Randy's house that's where he
lives<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.550> predator<00:03:28.030> thing<00:03:28.240> on<00:03:28.360> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
lives with the predator thing on the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
final thoughts on the lift kit it was a

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.850 
final thoughts on the lift kit it was a
lot<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.600> work<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:55.340> more<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.120> because<00:04:56.860> things

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
lot of work and more so because things

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.620 
lot of work and more so because things
are<00:04:58.010> rusted<00:04:58.370> things<00:04:58.580> are<00:04:58.729> old<00:04:58.910> things<00:04:59.300> for<00:04:59.600> a

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
things that were welded on there but I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.610 
things that were welded on there but I
can't<00:05:04.400> say<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.880> Jeep<00:05:05.090> looks<00:05:05.389> bad<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:06.410> is

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
can't say that the Jeep looks bad it is

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.140 
can't say that the Jeep looks bad it is
awesome<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.220> way<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.520> it's<00:05:07.669> sitting<00:05:08.030> up

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
awesome the way that it's sitting up

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.740 
awesome the way that it's sitting up
then<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.080> was<00:05:09.199> before<00:05:09.669> we<00:05:10.669> garnered<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.300> great

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
then it was before we garnered a great

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.560 
then it was before we garnered a great
amount<00:05:12.020> of<00:05:12.139> lift<00:05:12.349> from<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:12.979> kit<00:05:13.570> really

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
amount of lift from this kit really

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.570 
amount of lift from this kit really
changed<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.080> looks<00:05:15.289> of<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.470> Jeep<00:05:15.650> completely

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
changed the looks of the Jeep completely

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.250 
changed the looks of the Jeep completely
and<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.240> should<00:05:17.419> help<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.630> ride<00:05:17.840> because<00:05:18.050> we

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
and it should help the ride because we

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.870 
and it should help the ride because we
had<00:05:18.380> some<00:05:18.530> broken<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:19.010> sagging<00:05:19.340> Springs<00:05:19.669> and
