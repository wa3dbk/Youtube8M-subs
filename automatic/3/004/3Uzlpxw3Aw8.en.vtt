a sort of the same definition of

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.580 
a sort of the same definition of
fairness<00:01:44.549> whereas<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.259> from<00:01:46.380> what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
fairness whereas if I can take from what

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
fairness whereas if I can take from what
you<00:01:46.680> say<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> fairness<00:01:47.340> should<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.240> know

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you say that fairness should be you know

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
you say that fairness should be you know
in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> same<00:01:48.810> operate<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> opportunity<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in the same operate and opportunity to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
in the same operate and opportunity to
achieve<00:01:50.490> whereas<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> president<00:01:52.079> might

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
achieve whereas the president might

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
achieve whereas the president might
think<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.590> fairness<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.790> everyone

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think that fairness is that everyone

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060 
think that fairness is that everyone
have<00:01:54.479> an<00:01:54.570> education<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> everyone<00:01:55.770> can

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
have an education so that everyone can

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
have an education so that everyone can
then<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> achieve<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.750> simply

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then go on to achieve is it that simply

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.889 
then go on to achieve is it that simply
a<00:01:58.140> difference<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.149> definition<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> fairness

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a difference in definition of fairness

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
a difference in definition of fairness
or<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> president<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.280> almost

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
or do you think the president is almost

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.999 
or do you think the president is almost
deliberately<00:02:02.939> sinking<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> ship<00:02:03.979> well<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
deliberately sinking the ship well I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
deliberately sinking the ship well I
think<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> listen<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.240> President's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
think when you listen to the President's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.789 
think when you listen to the President's
speech<00:02:06.899> where<00:02:07.290> he's<00:02:07.409> talking<00:02:07.770> about

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
speech where he's talking about

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.630 
speech where he's talking about
supply-side<00:02:08.399> economics<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> fail<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.259> know

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
supply-side economics is fail you know

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.610 
supply-side economics is fail you know
it<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> his<00:02:11.330> economic<00:02:11.960> policies<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.530> have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it is his economic policies that have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.440 
it is his economic policies that have
failed<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.400> fact<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> president<00:02:14.360> is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
failed the fact that the president is

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
failed the fact that the president is
added<00:02:14.810> four<00:02:15.020> point<00:02:15.319> four<00:02:15.590> trillion<00:02:15.950> dollars

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
added four point four trillion dollars

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.490 
added four point four trillion dollars
of<00:02:16.550> new<00:02:16.580> debt<00:02:17.030> which<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:17.959> than<00:02:17.990> from

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of new debt which is more than from

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.620 
of new debt which is more than from
George<00:02:18.770> Washington<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.520> Bill<00:02:19.700> Clinton<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.600> I

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
George Washington to Bill Clinton so I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.180 
George Washington to Bill Clinton so I
think<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.020> thing<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.380> have<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> understand

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
think the thing we have to understand

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.650 
think the thing we have to understand
going<00:02:22.400> back<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.880> remembering<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.420> great

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
going back and remembering the great

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
at I believe in a constitutional

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.330 
at I believe in a constitutional
republic<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.680> don't<00:03:03.890> believe<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
republic I don't believe in the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.220 
republic I don't believe in the
bureaucratic<00:03:04.820> nanny<00:03:05.150> state<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.690> don't<00:03:06.140> believe

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
bureaucratic nanny state I don't believe

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.490 
bureaucratic nanny state I don't believe
in<00:03:06.560> manipulating<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.400> American<00:03:07.880> people<00:03:08.239> for

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
in manipulating the American people for

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.690 
in manipulating the American people for
political<00:03:09.500> gain<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> believe<00:03:10.160> we<00:03:10.280> have<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.550> be

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
political gain I believe we have to be

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.040 
political gain I believe we have to be
honest<00:03:11.060> with<00:03:11.180> them<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.570> tell<00:03:11.720> them<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.019> truth

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
honest with them and tell them the truth

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.900 
honest with them and tell them the truth
and<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.890> don't<00:03:13.100> think<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.489> President

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and I don't think that the President

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.550 
and I don't think that the President
sees<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.300> way<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.140> President

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
sees it that way I think the President

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.530 
sees it that way I think the President
believes<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.670> gaining

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
believes that this is about gaining

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.050

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
think about this race well let me put it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.440 
think about this race well let me put it
this<00:05:06.440> way<00:05:06.710> it's<00:05:06.980> not<00:05:07.190> about<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.760> individual

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
this way it's not about the individual

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.450

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
but this is what I think we have to have

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.890 
but this is what I think we have to have
in<00:05:10.640> a<00:05:10.700> candidate<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.300> go<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.540> against

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
President Obama it has to be someone

President Obama it has to be someone
