00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 amaury 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.469
 well let's go a little in time and assume that obama 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.659
 won the presidential election of the united states 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.369
 because what we are going to do at this point and albacete 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:23.210
 in fact that you see a lot on television they keep the news like cnn or fox 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.970
 It is a small rectangle landmark at the bottom that look more hands 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.839
 here 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.179
 ikea and without text for example 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.070
 latest news efe obama won the presidency of the united states 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.700
 or something like that and what happens is that this text repeats itself and repeats and 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.100
 repeating then what we are going to do is 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.840
 let's create a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.940
 a cycle where the same is being repeated 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.170
 text 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 and well let's accept a new web layer hands from the tool's 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.900
 rectangle make a small rectangle of color 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 your choice 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.350
 that she looks something like this and on top of this I'm not going to put my text 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 then let's put this 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 rectangle 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 a new layer for him tex 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 what with the tool the text in mind let's write 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.369
 Percentage that postpone 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.369
 last News 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.320
 let's put obama has won the elections 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 and then we're going to put a script here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.820
 I'm going to change the color of the text here are my sula properties 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.460
 white so we can obviously read it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 let's be a little bigger too 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.350
 if it is okay 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.460
 and good 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520
 what's up I think if it's okay 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.380
 what yes the next thing we have to do is 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 select the text in the copy editions 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 then the judges edition 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.020
 paste 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 In the same place 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.930
 then I have the same text from the same text above 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.819
 I'm going to move it to the right 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.040
 then I have been moving with the arrows of the keyboard to know us a bit towards 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.919
 here 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.639
 moving this to the right makes it hard to see the white text very well 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.370
 with 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.839
 gray but 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.119
 I believe that 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.079
 that there is more or less that's fine 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.219
 Now what I have is 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.499
 well I have the text here latest news obama has won the elections 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.700
 and then just when it ends I have again 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.359
 that same text 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.399
 ok right now in a few moments you will know why it says that 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.719
 well I will select your two texts go to modify will convert symbol 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.489
 and he's going to put it 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.749
 text 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.989
 Now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.989
 trace to that some frames we're going to put 30 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.159
 insert frame 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.319
 and in frame 30 crazy time are you 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.369
 a frame we are going to pay 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.950
 I sign around 30 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.950
 right click infect keyframe here 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.019
 and what I have to do to achieve that perfect site is not 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.879
 and I do not take off 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.019
 go through all this text 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.319
 I will continue to travel more 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.389
 I have to see where the first frame returns 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.919
 is key here where to cut here the blue rectangle is where the 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.509
 of cattle then not Iraqi 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.269
 go through May 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.279
 finish 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:40.799
 then just in that same place but the second text remember that 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.600
 we copied that same text and put it again to the right 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.570
 so I went through the text and right in the 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.659
 i bush that text 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.129
 then when they create right click there's mou bent interpol doing 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.709
 movements and those of 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.029
 program in English 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:05.299
 per hundred must create a cycle then let's see control test movie 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.769
 yes 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.849
 it is definitely there and it 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.379
 percent something that confuses is that it is 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.749
 good the text outside of what is provided in the 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.849
 but that's easy to fix let's create a mask quickly 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.189
 I'm going to create a new mons layer with more expensive names 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.150
 well I will create a rectangle 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 it does not matter the color to break a phosphorescent green 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.729
 and let's make a mask 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.689
 in what we want to reveal 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.129
 of what the text is 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.179
 we go boiled and about the size of the blue rectangle if you want you can 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.719
 leave some 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.620
 myspace here as you want 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.870
 then you have the rectangle right here where it's more expensive and 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.449
 good selected 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.379
 help a mask 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.870
 then 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.030
 well you can see here that the text does not come out of what is the rectangle 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.189
 it does not matter the blue rectangle but here you can see the lake of 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.089
 news that he complained that he is sorry 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.219
 just where positive the green rectangle 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.219
 all I hide from the control probad movie 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.900
 here to be able 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.470
 now the cycle is very fast then very simple also of 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.629
 correct that 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.819
 I'm going to drag here to select some frames 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.509
 p right click insert frame 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 everything was more 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.229
 it's still a little faster and you can select 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.229
 one more punch 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.099
 control test movie 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.659
 and now the team is being killed but obama has won the lÃ¼thi elections 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:47.659
 more news 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:48.900
 c of the world 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.629
 last detail how am I here 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.139
 is that the only problem is that neither the first frame that these and with the 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.969
 and in the last frame 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.659
 bots here stes actual lie bual then by 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.529
 thousandth of a second we are seeing 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.079
 we are seeing you can say the same frame twice 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.639
 because we have this from the end 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.729
 it is exactly or very similar to this 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.999
 from the beginning then the solution for that is 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.870
 petit right in a frame before the end 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.520
 what interest and infect keyframe 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.229
 and what we're going to do is to extract that keyframe that this pops 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.349
 that this one before the end 11 drag well the end 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.250
 then now the end frame 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.600
 the frame of the beginning is no longer the same then it is no longer that 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.619
 when kelly ends then we will finally give 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.210
 control test movie 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.880
 and well I think I know pretty well everything looks good 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.539
 and well let's hope obama wins 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.219
 thank you
