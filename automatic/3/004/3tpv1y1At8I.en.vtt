I see I begin a couple of hundred years
hopefully<00:03:18.299> exactly<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.780> same<00:03:18.959> heavily

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
hopefully exactly the same heavily

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
give them some rocket boot so if you fly

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.879 
give them some rocket boot so if you fly
around<00:03:22.230> rocket<00:03:22.769> boots<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.130> Mickey<00:03:23.780> no<00:03:24.780> way

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.920 

hopefully<00:03:28.889> won't<00:03:29.040> be<00:03:29.190> too<00:03:29.579> artificial

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
hopefully won't be too artificial

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.059 
hopefully won't be too artificial
aardvark<00:03:30.930> will<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.319> pity<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.950> will

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
aardvark will be so pity it will

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.220 
aardvark will be so pity it will
transcend<00:03:32.400> space<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:33.239> well<00:03:33.840> first<00:03:34.109> of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
transcend space and time well first of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.250 
transcend space and time well first of
all<00:03:34.260> let's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.960 

still<00:03:38.260> away<00:03:38.470> that's<00:03:38.980> almost<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.640> virtual

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
still away that's almost like a virtual

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.540 
still away that's almost like a virtual
reality<00:03:40.240> experience<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.440> can<00:03:41.710> smell<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.460> and

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
reality experience so I can smell it and

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.340 
reality experience so I can smell it and
taste<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.120> be<00:03:43.360> there<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.780> myself<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.170> think

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
taste it and be there and myself I think

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.400 
taste it and be there and myself I think
that<00:03:44.440> would<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.980> would<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.100> great
