00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 she water everyone here we are at 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.599
 victoria house at santa monica at los 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.099
 angeles sony organizes the playstation eye 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.630
 the victorian, that is, an event 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.700
 in which we could see a lot of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 sony games and here we will linger on the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 independent games so we saw them on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
 ps4 and on vita we will start with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 ps games when we watched closely being 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 no longer the series of hatreds that is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 a series of platform games rather 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 hardcore die and retry and we saw the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.689
 next episode finally in any case for 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.260
 sony consoles 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 so here we will have levels 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 different extra because 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 maybe still decided but maybe 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.700
 there will also be the levels of the old 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 opus episodes so the premise is 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 always the same so that there he goes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.809
 have to try to get to the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 door for that and finally activate 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.989
 switches and and especially avoid all 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 the pitfalls that are in the levels 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.770
 yaka coop also that remains interesting 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 because you have to play well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.469
 together there are some who often have to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.539
 to commit suicide to activate a switch 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.109
 for the other who is in another area 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.969
 of the amap piece so here it is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.799
 it's still a game like super interesting 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 and super addictive land for fans 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.350
 of the kind 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 behind in a completely different kind we have 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.780
 nuclear fauna then nuclear thrones 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 it is a regret that is already accessible 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.020
 laugh at the access on steam and who will 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.299
 also go out on ps4 ps vita and ps3 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 is in fact there the principle is that 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 it's a kind of shoot them up 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 so we end up with a character 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 who can shoot with different weapons in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 does he can pick up two weapons 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 different and switches behind this 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 that they find in the coffers he has 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.079
 a lot of monsters to kill you have to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 that they empty the area to move to the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.500
 next is pretty punchy 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.970
 it's pretty lively so it can be 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.020
 really interesting again 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.420
 for the player's fans for the phases 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 of shoot that moves well there are no 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.630
 masses of thought we say in all 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.759
 the senses and we are quickly avoided 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.439
 projectiles so that's classic but in 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.240
 anyway it's pretty good 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 levels are managed at random this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.140
 which is a bit leitmotif a nice shot 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.579
 from many independent games already 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.280
 of one because it costs 3 super expensive to 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.479
 make 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.159
 and more because it allows to have 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.460
 a long life and in fact when 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.540
 same thing for kas even if i do not know if 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.150
 I say welcome to our meaning is 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.020
 horrible but it's a game that have me 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.240
 all levels are created 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.020
 randomly also there we find ourselves 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.459
 in a mine 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.739
 and it's more of a platform game 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.360
 even could more accurate 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.130
 metroidvania in the genre ie 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.600
 how to find yourself evolving and 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.910
 try to gain new powers 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.800
 to move new areas as you go 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.780
 as gold needs to be sincere he 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.739
 We thought it was very classic 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.360
 true that at many games of the genre and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.590
 it's not easy to stand out and am 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.450
 I do not feel like they have 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 really the strength to stand out but 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.750
 good it can always please the kinds 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.870
 it was all about ps4 that we got them 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.340
 tested there have also been games vita one has 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.160
 could look very quickly 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.380
 haut-de-cagnes friend e 2 in which I 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300
 am dead about 700 times to be 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.560
 sincere to I have a little bit of trouble 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 it will actually adapt to the gameplay 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.239
 stick on vita for the game go yet 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.650
 it's a game that's pretty well done 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.360
 for but it's true that the sticks of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 I saw her on the spot I had a 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.170
 little bit of hurt personally ben there 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.730
 it's me do not worry at all 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.290
 good case always so hardcore of course 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.790
 it's stiff miami she's always a 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.540
 little music little music 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.140
 nice little bay at 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.810
 nice 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.970
 yesterday we also did binding of isaac 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.890
 rebirth which one of the big advantages 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.310
 will be able to play in coop there I saw 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.860
 all alone on vita there it seems to me 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.750
 good juhasz is very apt precisely the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.519
 manageability vita with ethics etc 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.410
 we find ourselves once again with 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.049
 levels randomly manage this is the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.180
 principle of baning with fisac 1 roguelike 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.950
 so we saw some new monsters 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.299
 have big critters that we see 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.760
 stuff in every way that's it 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.230
 always the same theme anyway and 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.150
 we gathered super interesting 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.070
 even if to use certain objects 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.810
 had to use the select key 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.099
 was not the most accessible 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.780
 possible will not fly shoes 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.150
 on the consoles with a big joystick 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.260
 we are going to say but here is in any case what 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.390
 that we could see as independent 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.580
 she had others on her neck etc 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.380
 we have not all tested in any case 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.370
 remains that the reasons for sony and that's 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.349
 true that they have a lot of things to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.660
 ready to propose on their different 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.510
 consoles so here we hope in everything 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.769
 case that you have more of a duty a 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.019
 little bit of all these games and we are going to 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.019
 leave on it rubber is hot
