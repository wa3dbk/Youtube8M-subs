from<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.830> glass<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.300> should<00:02:27.540> find<00:02:27.840> that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
from the glass and you should find that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.340 
from the glass and you should find that
it<00:02:28.290> has<00:02:28.500> been<00:02:28.740> fully<00:02:29.700> clean<00:02:32.990> this<00:02:33.990> will<00:02:34.200> also

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it has been fully clean this will also

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.650 
it has been fully clean this will also
bring<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.770> up<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> level<00:02:35.450> capable<00:02:36.450> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
bring it up to a level capable of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.930 
bring it up to a level capable of
maintaining<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.830> electrical<00:02:38.250> charging<00:02:38.670> for

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
maintaining the electrical charging for

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.150 
maintaining the electrical charging for
the<00:02:39.000> speaker<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.959> there<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.709> if

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the speaker and there you have it if

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.650 
the speaker and there you have it if
you're<00:02:41.310> having<00:02:41.459> any<00:02:41.670> problems<00:02:42.120> replicating

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
you're having any problems replicating

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.660 
you're having any problems replicating
our<00:02:42.720> previous<00:02:43.200> experiment<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.459> ahead

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
our previous experiment you can go ahead

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.760 
our previous experiment you can go ahead
and<00:02:44.880> try<00:02:45.240> these<00:02:45.300> methods<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.260> we've<00:02:46.530> just

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
and try these methods that we've just

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.800 
and try these methods that we've just
outlined<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.300> please<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.600> sure<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
outlined for you and please be sure to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.330 
outlined for you and please be sure to
