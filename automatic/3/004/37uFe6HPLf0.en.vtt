00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.110
 in the new assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.210
 there are next to the already lush 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.929
 still a lot of southwest to play 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.910
 experience 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 one of these side mission are the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 legendary ships in the game 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 There are four red marked ones 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 mission points on the map there is for 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 the legendary ships are loaded fat 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 Of course, these are especially difficult 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 Generally you should have your own ship 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 so have completely learned so that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.860
 all components at the highest level 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.809
 which ship you ship with which 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.100
 tactics best show we are 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.079
 you in this video 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 Let's start with the simplest ship 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.610
 the ghost ship that you see below right 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.649
 on the map you will find here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 principle only be fast and possible 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.910
 combine and execute many attacks 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 the ghost ship is not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.680
 particularly fast only the murderers 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.539
 You should try to dodge here 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.640
 is the first legendary ship defeated 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.260
 By the way, there are 20,000 real rewards 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.299
 the second ship on our list is 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 bottom left on the map and is called la 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.920
 dama negra the ship is already clear 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.479
 more difficult and its special 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 fast moerser make a damn lot 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.040
 That's why you're putting your foot down 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
 best right behind the ship 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 his moerser does not come there 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 Here you can ship with the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 slow down and then shoot 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.210
 to speak with your own ram 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.270
 exactly this tactic comes relatively 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.270
 fast to the next 20,000 reales 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.700
 our third ship is the l in pluto 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.010
 and you will find it at the top left of the map 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.320
 This ship is extremely dangerous 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.750
 it has a very strong battering ram and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.760
 extremely agile is important here 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.620
 immediately to attack already 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.690
 at the first attack of the ship should 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.100
 you do not try to dodge but 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.260
 the ship itself together 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.750
 ram plus direct leisure in 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.060
 combination lead here to the goal and to 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.770
 the next 20,000 reales we come 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.300
 the most difficult challenges above 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.979
 right on the map waiting here namely 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.580
 two ships directly on us 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.080
 sovereign and the sms much right after 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.150
 the cutscene try you both 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.310
 to take ships in the pliers and already 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.340
 That should be avoided because otherwise will 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.470
 the whole thing already relatively difficult one 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.480
 other important information is this 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.340
 when one ship is done the other 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 get a power and into one 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.380
 Blood rush expires just about it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.880
 you two ships first on 20 to 30 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.680
 shoot down percent 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.110
 Here again the tactics are recommended 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.430
 to stay behind one of the ships since 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.320
 Namely , the two ships 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.840
 Do not shoot each other 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.459
 relatively safe come to use here 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.220
 should then be the combination again 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.170
 you have shot chains and ram 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 so you have done both ships then 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.130
 also all legendary ships done 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.290
 and of course that gives an extra 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.150
 Reward namely the storm attack and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 this makes you the strongest ship in the world 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.450
 game 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.969
 we hope we could help you with this 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.500
 help a bit again and video 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.120
 if there are more tips and tricks 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.280
 he simply uses the comment 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.900
 area that was it from us and if it was 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.000
 then he will like it always 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000
