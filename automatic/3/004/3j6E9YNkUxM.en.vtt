though<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.519> get<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.700> point<00:02:15.000> ah<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
though but you get the point ah the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.770 
though but you get the point ah the
whole<00:02:18.239> gesture<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.670> fast<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.480> my

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
whole gesture is not that fast in my

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:35.869 
whole gesture is not that fast in my
opinion<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.819> know<00:02:32.909> it<00:02:33.150> works<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.700> one

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
opinion but you know it works this one

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.709 
opinion but you know it works this one
isn't<00:02:36.030> faster<00:02:36.959> either<00:02:37.909> it's<00:02:38.909> a<00:02:39.239> little<00:02:39.480> slower

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
isn't faster either it's a little slower

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.920 
isn't faster either it's a little slower
but<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.469> great<00:02:40.739> app<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> that's<00:02:42.299> basically

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
but it's a great app so that's basically

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
but it's a great app so that's basically
what<00:02:43.349> i<00:02:43.379> want<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.950> show<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:47.209> nothing<00:02:48.209> big
