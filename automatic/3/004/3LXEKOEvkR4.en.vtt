00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930
 the equalizer r

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.310
 happened 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.350
 3 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.370
 terry 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.440
 I could get used to something there 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.450
 plus 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.050
 kogler start 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.390
 ok thereby paying moncourt 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.899
 the property 50 euros 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.780
 where I had the judge watching work 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 then it's true 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 6 yes 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 I don't have any money there yet 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.090
 what 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 9 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.680
 that we will continue this way in the coming quarter, we can speak of a very 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.329
 disappointing profit 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.739
 the cost saving was insufficiently implemented 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.729
 to compensate for a decline in the past 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.509
 including gross incidental items 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.989
 the operating result decreased by more than 40 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.509
 per cent 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.199
 all this was caused 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.349
 by an unnamed colleague 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.809
 that as a strategist 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 high on our wage requirement 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.239
 the focus remains on reducing costs 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.239
 and decrease in debt position through capital discipline 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 only then do I expect that we will be in the coming quarter 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.329
 us from this downward position 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.179
 whining too 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.579
 appreciate 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.739
 our focus therefore remains focused 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.279
 on a better strategy 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.459
 m a good execution 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.919
 this colleague, who is not to be called 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.919
 will be addressed about this 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.709
 in the marketing department mistakes were made that could be earlier 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.599
 signaled 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.569
 No 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.639
 specific moments 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.429
 have passed 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.999
 on crucial decisions 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 that have not been recognized as interesting 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.029
 and with that have not been dealt with by certain persons 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.109
 d 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.149
 employee not to be specified is most likely not 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.149
 consciously 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.989
 that dismissal when the sword of damocles hangs over her very stupid head 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.149
 not one 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:06.609
 we look 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.889
 both numbers 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.329
 from last year 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.539
 May 16 and extreme fall 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.139
 the team and you win 9 7 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.079
 9 8 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.690

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.599

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.610

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.040

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.819

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.620
 that's all i looked at 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.620
 can take care of it 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.930
 had the increase in the cost price of the gross margins 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.759
 less than 2 percent on top of a drop in sales of less than 40 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.089
 per cent 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.089
 and which team is responsible for that, Mrs. van de Kerkhof 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.849
 I have the new plans according to ING 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.120
