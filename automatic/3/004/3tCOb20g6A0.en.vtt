1800s because we're trying to make a
traditional<00:02:06.540> product<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:07.650> also<00:02:08.069> relied<00:02:08.399> on

traditional product they also relied on

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
traditional product they also relied on
the<00:02:08.729> experience<00:02:09.269> of<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.599> micro<00:02:10.080> distillers

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the experience of other micro distillers

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
the experience of other micro distillers
it's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.220> group<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.640> doesn't<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.090> upon<00:02:12.360> each

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it's a group that doesn't look upon each

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
it's a group that doesn't look upon each
other<00:02:12.689> as<00:02:12.870> competitors<00:02:13.019> as<00:02:13.590> much<00:02:14.159> as<00:02:14.310> allies

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
traditional moonshiners is that it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.490 
traditional moonshiners is that it

we<00:03:08.209> wanted<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.660> something<00:03:08.959> craft<00:03:09.500> with<00:03:10.430> our

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
we wanted to do something craft with our

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.020 
we wanted to do something craft with our
hands<00:03:11.000> sort<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.390> an<00:03:11.720> artistic<00:03:12.760> venture<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.880> you

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
hands sort of an artistic venture if you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.330 
hands sort of an artistic venture if you
will<00:03:14.209> getting<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.349> basics<00:03:15.799> down<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.220> all

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
will getting the basics down is all

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.069 
will getting the basics down is all
about<00:03:16.579> formulas<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.360> making<00:03:17.690> proper

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
about formulas and making proper

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.710 
about formulas and making proper
calculations<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.700> was<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> science

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
calculations this was like a science

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
calculations this was like a science
project<00:03:20.780> for<00:03:21.350> Richard<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.579> Kulas

project for Richard and I and a Kulas

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
project for Richard and I and a Kulas
project<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.660> can<00:03:23.810> ever<00:03:23.959> imagine<00:03:24.340> injecting

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
project you can ever imagine injecting

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.920 
project you can ever imagine injecting
the<00:03:25.459> desired<00:03:25.819> flavor<00:03:26.209> into<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.630> finished

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the desired flavor into the finished

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.750 
the desired flavor into the finished
product<00:03:27.319> is<00:03:27.470> where<00:03:27.650> an<00:03:27.739> artistic<00:03:28.310> touch<00:03:28.489> is

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
product is where an artistic touch is

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.449 
product is where an artistic touch is
needed<00:03:29.209> we<00:03:30.200> basically<00:03:30.500> look<00:03:30.799> at<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:30.980> alcohol

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
needed we basically look at the alcohol

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.069 
needed we basically look at the alcohol
as<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:31.700> comes<00:03:31.880> off<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.150> steel<00:03:32.420> over<00:03:32.720> about<00:03:33.019> a

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
as it comes off the steel over about a

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.770 
as it comes off the steel over about a
12<00:03:33.380> hour<00:03:33.560> period<00:03:33.889> we<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.549> cut<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.000> based

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
12 hour period we have to cut it based

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.670 
12 hour period we have to cut it based
on<00:03:35.959> fruit<00:03:36.639> temperature<00:03:37.639> of<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> steel<00:03:38.680> taste

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
on fruit temperature of the steel taste

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.490 
on fruit temperature of the steel taste
and<00:03:39.980> smell<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.049> sort<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.319> have<00:03:42.440> to

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and smell and so you sort of have to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.900 
and smell and so you sort of have to
train<00:03:42.739> your<00:03:42.889> palate<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:43.519> used<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.819> doing

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
train your palate to get used to doing

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.610 
train your palate to get used to doing
that<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:44.600> what<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:44.989> that's<00:03:45.200> sort<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
that and what you do that's sort of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.069 
that and what you do that's sort of the
art<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:45.889> making<00:03:46.190> whiskey<00:03:46.519> make<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.079> accurate
