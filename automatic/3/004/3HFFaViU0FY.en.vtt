and<00:00:21.720> burn<00:00:22.140> more<00:00:22.529> fat<00:00:23.029> quicker<00:00:24.029> than<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and burn more fat quicker than you you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
and burn more fat quicker than you you
ever<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.140> before<00:00:25.849> so<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.609> leptin

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
ever have before so you know that leptin

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.560 
ever have before so you know that leptin
is<00:00:29.990> actually<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.320> fat<00:00:32.070> burning<00:00:32.520> hormone<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
is actually a fat burning hormone that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.030 
is actually a fat burning hormone that
occurs<00:00:33.809> naturally<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> body<00:00:34.440> is

lead to an increase in appetite food

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.369 
lead to an increase in appetite food

leptin<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:52.680> from<00:00:52.949> adipose<00:00:53.640> tissue<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
leptin comes from adipose tissue it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
leptin comes from adipose tissue it's
also<00:00:54.660> known<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.020> body<00:00:55.230> fat<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.520> more

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
also known as body fat and the more

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.049 
also known as body fat and the more
obese<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.270> overweight<00:00:57.360> someone<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> more

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
obese or overweight someone is the more

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.889 
obese or overweight someone is the more
of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> hormone<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> present<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> body<00:01:02.899> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
of the hormone is present in the body so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
of the hormone is present in the body so
as<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.199> lose<00:01:04.500> weight<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> body<00:01:05.100> tends<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
as people lose weight the body tends to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.789 
as people lose weight the body tends to
increase<00:01:05.790> leptin<00:01:06.420> production<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
increase leptin production and what that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.350 
increase leptin production and what that
does<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> sends<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> message<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> false

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
does is it sends a message of false

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
does is it sends a message of false
hunger<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> brain<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> makes<00:01:10.979> weight

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
hunger to the brain and it makes weight

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.420 
hunger to the brain and it makes weight
loss<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.299> difficult<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> makes<00:01:13.200> people<00:01:13.619> seem

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
loss more difficult it makes people seem

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.410 
loss more difficult it makes people seem
actually<00:01:14.750> hungrier<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:15.990> are

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
actually hungrier than they are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.800 
actually hungrier than they are
leptin<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.689> plays<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> significant<00:01:19.590> role<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
leptin also plays a significant role in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
leptin also plays a significant role in
metabolism<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.439> fat<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.240> energy<00:01:24.240> production

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
metabolism of fat and energy production

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.530 
metabolism of fat and energy production
it<00:01:25.320> regulates<00:01:25.770> appetite<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.700> hunger<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it regulates appetite and hunger to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
it regulates appetite and hunger to
ensure<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> body<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.409> enough<00:01:28.619> energy<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
ensure the body has enough energy and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.539 
ensure the body has enough energy and
stored<00:01:29.430> calories<00:01:30.770> one<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> big<00:01:32.369> issues

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
stored calories one of the big issues

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.630 
stored calories one of the big issues
with<00:01:33.000> leptin<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.960> leptin<00:01:34.710> resistance<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
with leptin is leptin resistance and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.630 
with leptin is leptin resistance and
that<00:01:36.210> occurs<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.590> levels<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.189> leptin

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that occurs when the levels of leptin

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.240 
that occurs when the levels of leptin
hormones<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.360> high<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.560> brain<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> not

sending out signals that you're

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
sending out signals that you're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
sending messages of being full and it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.340
