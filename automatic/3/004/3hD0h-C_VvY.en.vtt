00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.220 
mean what else this is 1.6 I'll also
make<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.859> separate<00:03:17.400> video<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.780> people<00:03:19.109> are

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
with 1.6 so i'll make a video on how to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
with 1.6 so i'll make a video on how to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the link in the description go to that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.650 
the link in the description go to that
video<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.470> i<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.519> sharpness<00:03:36.420> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
video so here i have sharpness so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.130 
video so here i have sharpness so
sharpness<00:03:37.170> particles<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:37.799> actually<00:03:38.310> green

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
sharpness particles are actually green

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.410 
sharpness particles are actually green
not<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> expected<00:03:40.500> but<00:03:41.310> I'm<00:03:42.200> still<00:03:43.200> cool

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
not what I expected but I'm still cool

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.780 
not what I expected but I'm still cool
these<00:03:45.500> think<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.680> makes<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.130> look<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.549> like

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
these think it makes it look like like

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.490 
these think it makes it look like like
you<00:03:48.030> know<00:03:48.150> you'll<00:03:48.480> kill<00:03:48.750> them<00:03:48.840> faster<00:03:49.290> that

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
you know you'll kill them faster that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.590 
you know you'll kill them faster that
way<00:03:49.530> being<00:03:50.310> green<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.510> guess<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.620> looks<00:03:52.650> cool

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
way being green I guess it looks cool

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.509 
way being green I guess it looks cool
also<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.870> looks<00:03:55.019> nice<00:03:55.410> because<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.069> like<00:03:56.250> this
