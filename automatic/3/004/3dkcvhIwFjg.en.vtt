00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 eibar you know where will be where he went 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 she said that she went to change 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.639
 avatar I think we will not be brothers anymore 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.710
 maybe but surely it will not change that much 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.990
 if maybe you got a render of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.810
 some human or something 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 I got friends and how they are but what 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 You're a pony if you do not like it 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 of my second favorite pony since the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 rainbow was already spent but such 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.450
 Once I had stayed Scutaro is very 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.170
 weird that there is now a pony as boss 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.410
 seriously what a ridiculous excuse and who are 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 bite here and up are animals I do not 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 I can be a fucking pony and the anti 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 Bronis van bardear if you do not like 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.719
 my avatar for forgiveness but came good 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.719
 to stay 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 and good friends have changed youtube 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 avatar because I was sick of lisa 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.409
 simpson but especially because I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 I found a video called salven warned 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.630
 that I leave in the description of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.689
 video but wonder who is from erp 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 and well 'dirty is a character of the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.250
 my little pony series known as 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 background character but its original 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.350
 way mostly of his eyes cross-eyed the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 they make one of the most beloved 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.110
 the brownies but from an episode that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.390
 was canceled once he spoke to me 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 first time but by having a voice by 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 so to say it silly people are 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.649
 They bothered with the hasbro company because 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 they said being offensive to people 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.539
 with mental disability well of that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 I wanted to talk about the matter 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.330
 people consider an offensive derby 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 good in the opinion of others I do not think that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 derby be an offensive pony because I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.399
 I wonder what's wrong with it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 a pony with mental disability I do not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 I think it's wrong because I see that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.970
 represents those 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.670
 in opinion it would be worse than not the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.190
 put in because it would not take into account 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.440
 people with such mental problems 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.930
 time in the shape of your eyes can be a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.110
 both offensive but not to take it to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.480
 get out of the air because following what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 I said term I think it strengthens a 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.250
 bad stereotype say that it is also 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.740
 by his way of speaking when listening to the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.900
 video where she was talking I did not see for 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.390
 nothing offensive she did not say anything 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.140
 subnormal like some on facebook that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 they say roasts or things like that she speaks well 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.670
 besides saying that it's in quotes 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.160
 offensive I think not or you're going to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.290
 say that because cecor to my zebra 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.500
 little pony represents blacks is 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.930
 racist stop fuck up here came 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.480
 my video but first of all I want 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.820
 make a small tribute to derby by 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.370
 be a special support I know it's weird 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.770
 do that with a pony but one puts that 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.360
 it shows to be different from the others I think 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.880
 what is valued 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.880
 when the photos begin we'll see 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.200
 i 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.480
 if it is not better 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.010
 in this life 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.010
 it is tradition 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.520
 and more 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.810
 after 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.790

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.110
