00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
with the nude red this is a good product

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.109 
with the nude red this is a good product
if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:50.070> low<00:01:50.369> hair<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
if you have low hair and you want to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.539 
if you have low hair and you want to
start<00:01:51.329> early<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.780> dreads<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.310> know

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
start early with dreads but just know

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
start early with dreads but just know
that<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.689> dreads<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.200> longer<00:01:55.619> using

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that as your dreads get longer using

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
that as your dreads get longer using
that<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> twist<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.729> longer<00:01:56.909> you're

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that as the twist get longer you're

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.249 
that as the twist get longer you're
probably<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> eventually

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
probably going to have to eventually

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780 
probably going to have to eventually
once<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.159> once<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> gets<00:01:59.700> past

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
once because I think once it gets past

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.700 
once because I think once it gets past
like<00:02:00.149> five<00:02:00.390> inches<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.140> can't<00:02:01.380> use<00:02:01.590> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
like five inches you can't use this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560 
like five inches you can't use this
anymore<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.130> won't<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.430> work<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.360> you'll

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
anymore it won't really work so you'll

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.370 
anymore it won't really work so you'll
probably<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
probably have to go get it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.450 
probably have to go get it
professionally<00:02:04.860> done<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> they'll<00:02:05.310> probably

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
professionally done and they'll probably

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.150 
professionally done and they'll probably
combine<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.899> twists<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> your<00:02:07.950> locs

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
combine the the twists so that your locs

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
combine the the twists so that your locs
won't<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.970> too<00:02:09.119> thin<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.989> do

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
won't you know be too thin so you can do

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
won't you know be too thin so you can do
it<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.830> want<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> go<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.550> a

that'll<00:04:36.090> make<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.300> grow<00:04:36.570> faster<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.050> guess<00:04:37.290> and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
that'll make it grow faster I guess and

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.140 
that'll make it grow faster I guess and
like<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.830> guess<00:04:38.010> keep<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.340> kind<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.580> nappy<00:04:38.970> I

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
like I guess keep it kind of nappy I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.110 
like I guess keep it kind of nappy I
guess<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.020> makes<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.260> easier<00:04:40.590> so<00:04:40.970> should<00:04:41.970> be

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
guess that makes it easier so should be

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.330 
guess that makes it easier so should be
