really soft I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.330 
really soft I'm not sure if I'm going to
use<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:12.750> blend<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.340> foundation

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
use this to like blend out my foundation

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.309 
use this to like blend out my foundation
my<00:02:14.370> liquid<00:02:14.819> foundation<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.080> use

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
my liquid foundation if I can just use

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.610 
my liquid foundation if I can just use
it<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:17.000> my<00:02:18.000> blush<00:02:18.510> brush<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.020> pretty<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:19.440> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it for my blush brush but pretty much I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.110

think you can use this for a lot of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.510 
think you can use this for a lot of
different<00:02:21.390> uses<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.110> again<00:02:22.530> look<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.400> the
