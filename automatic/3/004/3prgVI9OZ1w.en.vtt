 of e3 advertising is what bothers me 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.440
 of 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.440
 in these types of applications 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.190

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.720
 that they are appearing 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.660
 you need looking for the ones you liked 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.660
 in the search engine 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.080
 camps 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.230
 because monkey is fine 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.610
 good 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.370
 like new pokemon carving the last 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.860
 thing that I explain to you is because I 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.900
 I forgot to explain something to them because if 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.080
 sometimes it happens to them that it does not leave them 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.550
 enter the application and take it out to 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.210
 you will give him respite or he will 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:27.170
 update the cydia in massive sic 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.560
 already installation tweet or something that it says 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.800
 update or you give reinstall 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.510
 the tweet that we just installed and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.210
 when that is going to work again 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.130
 because they have slight failures that you do not 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.850
 they let in when after the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.370
 you stop doing for a certain time and good 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.139
 that 's the last thing I wanted to explain and 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.060
