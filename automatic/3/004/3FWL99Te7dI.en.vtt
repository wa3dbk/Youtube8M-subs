it in the bowl and make sure you make it
all<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.220> nice<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:00.300> all<00:02:00.420> broken<00:02:00.870> up

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.640 

and<00:02:08.490> that's<00:02:09.210> going<00:02:09.480> to<00:02:09.540> look<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.440> that's

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
and that's going to look like and that's

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.540 
and that's going to look like and that's
how<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.130> look<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.400> you've<00:02:11.520> done

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
how it's going to look what you've done

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.660 
how it's going to look what you've done
and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.240> I'm<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.420> taking<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:13.250> icing<00:02:14.250> I'm

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and then I'm just taking my icing I'm

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.370 
and then I'm just taking my icing I'm
just<00:02:15.030> going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.270> add<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.290> gets

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
just going to add that to it so it gets

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.800 
just going to add that to it so it gets
a<00:02:16.500> bit<00:02:16.530> moist<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.400> easier<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> make<00:02:17.940> like

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
a bit moist so it's easier to make like

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
a bit moist so it's easier to make like
roll<00:02:19.140> balls<00:02:19.470> out<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> i<00:02:20.340> discovered

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
roll balls out of it and i discovered

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.360 
roll balls out of it and i discovered
that<00:02:21.350> using<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> spring<00:02:22.770> wasn't<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> good<00:02:23.280> idea

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that using the spring wasn't a good idea

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:34.020 
that using the spring wasn't a good idea
so<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.140> mixed<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.290> my<00:02:25.440> hands

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.290 

and<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.620> balls<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.580> you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
and you just make little balls and you

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.600 
and you just make little balls and you
kind<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.600> squeeze<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.080> together<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:39.069> just

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
kind of squeeze it together and just

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.740 
kind of squeeze it together and just

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
roll them and put them on a tray so now

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.900

I've<00:02:43.900> got<00:02:44.140> my<00:02:44.260> candy<00:02:44.650> buttons<00:02:44.800> in<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> bowl<00:02:45.580> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
I've got my candy buttons in a bowl and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.940 
I've got my candy buttons in a bowl and
I'm<00:02:46.090> taking<00:02:46.240> my<00:02:46.450> lollipop<00:02:46.870> stick<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.800> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
I'm taking my lollipop stick and I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.190 
I'm taking my lollipop stick and I
melted<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.370> candy<00:02:48.640> buttons<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.330> I'm<00:02:50.020> just

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
don't push it too far because it might

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.540 
don't push it too far because it might
like<00:02:54.880> break<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.950> I'm<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.220> doing<00:02:57.520> this

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.470
