00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Ta' came up wins so far in all of baseball 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.500
 To talk 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.250
 I want to pl 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.250
 I want to keep firmly here in order to catch up a 9-point difference 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.370
 I hit the top batter 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.630
 9th 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 Then Naka-gun 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:40.690
 Today's starter is 2nd grader Yamamoto this 2nd grader South Pauly 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.630
 The team played the finals 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:50.079
 Power throw continued, but there was also a moment of protection , and scored in the early stage 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.300
 The valley of the second place also shows good throw 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 It was swallowed up by the clean-up center which is vacant 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.600
 It is Shibuya of ace number to go up to mound 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 Please note the foul ball 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 Hmm 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.280
 Next time I took it to the sword 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.270
 First 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.270
 Leftta Miller 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.159
 Now 9 times 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.159
 It is Osaka's Chap store to meet you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.930
 A match between Ace Shibuya and Captain Nakamura 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 Buch 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.030
 Bad 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.720
 I'm there 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.420
 After going up to mound 7 times, this severe 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.420
 There is one foreball that I have not forgiven for a moment 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.300
 Come on this whole country too 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.600
 Powerful batter 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.600
 Is it possible to beat with a pitch with the thought of Nakamura ? 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.030
 Clogged with a line 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.150
 That's fine 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.150
 Nakamura is good to go to the second base in this area 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.670
 It became several races as a record 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.670
 Proud fast pace 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.930
 It is a picture downy wonderful likely 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 There is a ceiling and there is a little bit of sun, though-I'm not sure ia 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.709
 I'm the captain, yes I'm just a broken fighter and it's a great fighter 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.510
 I think I think that would receive a little crowd I fireworks at buzzer 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.769
 I think you think I wish I had skate from the foot 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.050
 I was told that there is still some pain in the shock, but if so he 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.160
 Number 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.550
 There is a 2nd Enomoto being hot in the seat 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.550

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:14.090
 This Shibuya that there was more than 109 power throws yesterday 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.090
 Today, the juniors couldn't stop the force of the Osaka team 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:25.150
 Nakatsuka took a ball though this is also the opposite direction 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.150
 Come on pls head to the last attack with a store point difference
