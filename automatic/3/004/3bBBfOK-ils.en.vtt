00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.509
 how to make a chocolate cake 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.669
 It is a very easy recipe and it will take you 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.680
 the truth very soon the first thing that 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.620
 we have to realize is to preheat the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.870
 oven at 170 degrees during 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.250
 approximately 10 minutes to 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.290
 then we will proceed to perform 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.740
 the cake for this we need the 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.810
 following ingredients 3 eggs 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 about 300 grams of flour 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.279
 it is important that it be a special good 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 for pastry since another one does not 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.630
 it would be the same 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.270
 let's see a glass of milk 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.160
 100 grams of cocoa and 150 grams of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.510
 sugar 100 grams of melted butter 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.760
 an envelope of yeast and a pinch of salt 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.010
 but normally this recipe can be 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.899
 beat by hand although in this case I eat 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.420
 I have the thermomix I'm going to do it for 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.940
 here but let's go as I said 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.280
 completely normal to do it by hand 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.530
 with gauze and a rod that is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.449
 You can also do the first thing that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.300
 we have to do is sell the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.550
 melted butter inside the saucepan 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.000
 or the bowl in case you go to 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.950
 beat to spot we see how we sell the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.270
 Butter 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.040
 and then we take and let's go 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.500
 the three eggs 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.500
 we open one 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 two 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.570
 and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.140
 3 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 perfect and flour 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.520
 we are growing little by little with care 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 that we do not fall 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.530
 by a 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.530
 now I'm going to close the thermal 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 with the trash 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.920
 and I'm going to give it to you 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.060
 Let us look as it has not been the dough 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.850
 you have seen now what we are going to 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.270
 to proceed is to throw the milk 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.950
 the glass of milk 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.950
 and we close again 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.990
 and we leave it to beat another minute 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.110
 as it has been in warning milk 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.430
 you see how it is now more creamy 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.080
 now and we will proceed to take the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.230
 sugar and cocoa together with the yeast 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.150
 and a pinch of salt 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.019
 we spill everything well inside 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.019
 from the bowl 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760
 and now we have the yeast 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.560
 and a handful of salt 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.800
 and nothing more 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.900
 I recommend that when you use the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.530
 cocoa is that there are 5 special everything like 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 for chocolate to the cup or something like that 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.910
 be quite strong I do not recommend the 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.060
 tail cao because it is very soft and can 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.760
 be less intense then now 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.220
 let's proceed to mix again and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.460
 then we put about this 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.620
 another minute more once finished 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.320
 beat the dough present him an aspect 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.080
 like this what we have to proceed to 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.550
 below is the plank in a mold in 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.320
 this case I will use a mold of 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.060
 silicone but if in your house 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.310
 you use a metal mold is 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.290
 important that you have it well since if 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.570
 it is not possible that it sticks to the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.090
 mass to the mold in the silicone molds 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.400
 this problem does not usually happen so 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.569
 directly without greasing and without anything 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 to put the dough 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.250
 little by little 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.250
 here in the cut 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.220
 we are pouring 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.930
 thus 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.430
 proceeded to pour all the content 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.460
 we will insert it into the mold 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.639
 inside the oven in this way 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.580
 we leave it inside and we're going to leave it 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.590
 cook approximately 20 minutes average 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.110
 hour you have to be aware of the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.330
 oven so you do not burn the way 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 to check that the viscose is fine 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.110
 done and it has not burned is catching 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.720
 investing a small rod inside 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.419
 of the cake and on the stick comes out dry 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.569
 is that the coso is well done if it comes out 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.340
 a little bit stingy is that it still has 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.940
 a bit to be done therefore 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.770
 we will leave a few more minutes 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.580
 relationship I will proceed to take out the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.580
 biscuit from the oven 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.030
 how viscous the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.340
 definitive proof to know what is 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.770
 well done is to insert a small 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.660
 stick like this one and see if it comes out clean 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.760
 as you can see the toothpick is not 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.130
 stained this which means that the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.840
 Consell is ready to be served 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.430
 so let's proceed to your 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.870
 presentation 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.210
 the final aspect presented by the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.640
 cake as you can see has been very 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.409
 spongy once served will present a 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.539
 look like this 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.610
 you can see it I decorated with icing sugar 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.889
 and whipped cream but you can 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.619
 decorate it with whatever you want syrup 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.809
 marmalade candies chocolates is already 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.550
 question of the taste of each one this is 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:08.860
 a really delicious dish and as you can see 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.479
 it does not have anything of complication I hope that 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.439
 enjoy cooking them and see you 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.439
 until next time
