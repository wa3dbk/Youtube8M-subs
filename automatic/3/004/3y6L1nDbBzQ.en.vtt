what we're going to show today is first
off<00:00:12.920> one<00:00:13.580> of<00:00:13.610> our<00:00:13.760> soldier<00:00:14.150> moves<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:14.690> raven

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
off one of our soldier moves so raven

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.150 
off one of our soldier moves so raven
has<00:00:15.890> a<00:00:15.950> pretty<00:00:16.520> large<00:00:16.880> motion<00:00:17.779> capture<00:00:18.050> studio

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
has a pretty large motion capture studio

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.580 
has a pretty large motion capture studio
and<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.460> helps<00:00:19.730> us<00:00:19.880> with<00:00:20.180> doing<00:00:20.869> you<00:00:21.500> know

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
and it helps us with doing you know

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.090 
and it helps us with doing you know
realistic<00:00:22.160> you<00:00:22.610> know<00:00:22.640> soldier<00:00:23.029> movements<00:00:23.570> and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
realistic you know soldier movements and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.339 
realistic you know soldier movements and
we<00:00:25.100> wanted<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.400> really<00:00:25.640> keep<00:00:25.880> with<00:00:26.150> the

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
we wanted to really keep with the

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.990 
we wanted to really keep with the
realistic<00:00:27.349> person<00:00:27.650> kind<00:00:28.640> of<00:00:28.669> go<00:00:28.790> a<00:00:28.820> little

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
realistic person kind of go a little

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.890 
realistic person kind of go a little
further<00:00:29.270> with<00:00:29.540> some<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.869> other

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
further with some of the other

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.060 
further with some of the other
characters<00:00:30.200> that<00:00:30.529> I'm<00:00:30.650> going<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.800> show<00:00:30.919> you<00:00:31.009> a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
characters that I'm going to show you a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.720 
characters that I'm going to show you a
little<00:00:31.220> bit<00:00:31.310> later<00:00:32.470> so<00:00:33.470> first<00:00:33.680> off<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.460> go<00:00:34.579> into

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
little bit later so first off we go into

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.069 
little bit later so first off we go into
motion<00:00:34.880> capture<00:00:35.210> studio<00:00:35.380> record<00:00:37.420> good<00:00:38.420> chunk

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
motion capture studio record good chunk

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.410 
motion capture studio record good chunk
of<00:00:39.170> moves<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:40.130> actually<00:00:40.250> faster<00:00:40.850> than<00:00:41.120> key

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
of moves it's actually faster than key

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.780 
of moves it's actually faster than key
framing<00:00:41.660> for<00:00:41.900> us<00:00:42.190> we<00:00:43.190> can<00:00:43.340> get<00:00:43.460> about<00:00:43.550> 100

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
framing for us we can get about 100

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.530 
framing for us we can get about 100
moves<00:00:44.150> done<00:00:44.390> pretty<00:00:45.050> fast<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.300> once<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:47.450> get

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
moves done pretty fast so once we get

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.530 
moves done pretty fast so once we get
that<00:00:47.720> from<00:00:47.960> them<00:00:48.140> we've<00:00:48.530> got<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.540> uncleaned

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
that from them we've got the uncleaned

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.180 
that from them we've got the uncleaned
you<00:00:51.260> can<00:00:51.380> see<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.830> they<00:00:51.920> actually<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
you can see this is they actually the

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.850 
you can see this is they actually the
same<00:00:52.430> move<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:52.990> that<00:00:53.990> and<00:00:54.290> that's<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.650> actual

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
same move but that and that's the actual

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.940 
same move but that and that's the actual
pose<00:00:55.100> we<00:00:55.280> needed<00:00:55.490> to<00:00:55.580> go<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.730> for<00:00:56.360> blending<00:00:57.020> the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
pose we needed to go to for blending the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.600 
pose we needed to go to for blending the
uncleaned<00:00:59.050> gets<00:01:00.050> up<00:01:00.230> sprays<00:01:00.800> from<00:01:01.400> behind

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
uncleaned gets up sprays from behind

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.270 
uncleaned gets up sprays from behind
cover<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:02.240> goes<00:01:02.420> back<00:01:02.600> down<00:01:02.840> very<00:01:03.830> unclean

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
cover and goes back down very unclean

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.890 
cover and goes back down very unclean
kind<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.180> know<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:05.810> basic<00:01:06.380> movement

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
kind of you know just basic movement

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.640 
kind of you know just basic movement
then<00:01:08.900> for<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.229> second<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.360> do<00:01:11.540> is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
then for the second one what we do is

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.990 
then for the second one what we do is
animator<00:01:12.650> takes<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.100> puts<00:01:13.369> with<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.610> pose<00:01:13.790> on

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
animator takes it puts with the pose on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.450 
animator takes it puts with the pose on
at<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.150> beginning<00:01:14.830> cleaned<00:01:15.830> up<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.070> little<00:01:16.190> bit

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
at the beginning cleaned up a little bit

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.870 
at the beginning cleaned up a little bit
has<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.940> little<00:01:17.150> bit<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.390> time<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.110> polish<00:01:18.320> and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
has a little bit of time to polish and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.430 
has a little bit of time to polish and
the<00:01:19.880> result<00:01:20.300> we<00:01:20.570> speed<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.840> up<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.110> little<00:01:21.230> bit

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
the result we speed it up a little bit

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.620 
the result we speed it up a little bit
and<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:22.159> result<00:01:22.550> has<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.909> little<00:01:23.180> more<00:01:23.270> kick<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and the result has a little more kick to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.570 
and the result has a little more kick to
the<00:01:23.810> gun<00:01:24.050> gets<00:01:24.830> in<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.159> out<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.250> cover<00:01:25.520> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the gun gets in and out of cover a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.570 
the gun gets in and out of cover a
little<00:01:25.670> faster<00:01:26.210> little<00:01:27.130> better<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.340> gameplay

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
little faster little better for gameplay

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.340 
little faster little better for gameplay
purposes<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:31.479> then<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:32.570> can<00:01:32.750> blend<00:01:33.080> in<00:01:33.260> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
purposes and then we can blend in and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.930 
purposes and then we can blend in and
out<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.590> every<00:01:33.800> move<00:01:33.979> because<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.430> lot<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.850> the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
out of every move because a lot of the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.880 
out of every move because a lot of the
same<00:01:35.120> poses<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.979> geist<00:01:37.220> is<00:01:37.610> by<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.830> term<00:01:39.830> of

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
same poses the the geist is by a term of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.980 
same poses the the geist is by a term of
sorts<00:01:40.270> energy<00:01:41.270> collector<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.870> once<00:01:44.870> he

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
sorts energy collector and once he

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.690 
sorts energy collector and once he
collects<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.380> energy<00:01:45.650> we<00:01:45.770> using<00:01:46.400> this<00:01:46.460> little

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
collects the energy we using this little

guess you would say and so this is a one
of<00:02:33.980> his<00:02:34.129> movement<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.579> stop<00:02:34.999> animations<00:02:35.599> for

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
of his movement to stop animations for

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.569 
of his movement to stop animations for
when<00:02:36.170> he's<00:02:36.349> getting<00:02:36.499> ready<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.829> drink<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:39.260> of

when he's getting ready to drink kind of
plant<00:02:40.579> those<00:02:40.819> feel<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.180> little<00:02:41.329> bit<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.889> very

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
plant those feel a little bit and very

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.909 
plant those feel a little bit and very
very<00:02:47.260> hard<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.349> move<00:02:48.500> kept<00:02:48.650> something<00:02:48.829> like

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
very hard to move kept something like

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.860 
very hard to move kept something like
that<00:02:49.159> so<00:02:49.819> by<00:02:50.180> we've<00:02:50.629> used<00:02:50.900> keyframe<00:02:51.680> for

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
that so by we've used keyframe for

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.510 
that so by we've used keyframe for
characters<00:02:53.870> such<00:02:54.049> as<00:02:54.079> this

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.220 

yeah<00:02:57.520> well<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:58.570> a<00:03:00.600> well<00:03:01.600> soon<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.990> change

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
yeah well we have a well soon to change

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.670 
yeah well we have a well soon to change
but<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.650> 28<00:03:03.220> cameras<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.680> motion

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
but we have 28 cameras this is a motion

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.940 
but we have 28 cameras this is a motion
analysis<00:03:06.160> motion<00:03:06.700> capture<00:03:06.940> system<00:03:07.950> 28

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
analysis motion capture system 28

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.220 
analysis motion capture system 28
cameras<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.370> about<00:03:09.520> 20<00:03:10.420> surrounding<00:03:10.900> for

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
cameras we have about 20 surrounding for

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.830 
cameras we have about 20 surrounding for
up<00:03:11.320> top<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.830> four<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.700> sides<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.330> get<00:03:13.450> low

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
up top and four on the sides to get low

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.030 
up top and four on the sides to get low
angles<00:03:16.080> we're<00:03:17.700> mainly<00:03:18.700> captioned<00:03:19.090> body<00:03:20.040> body

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
angles we're mainly captioned body body

angles we're mainly captioned body body
data<00:03:21.780> face<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.200> finger<00:03:23.680> animation<00:03:24.130> where<00:03:24.310> we

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
data face and finger animation where we

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.120 
data face and finger animation where we
really<00:03:25.080> found<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.440> easier<00:03:26.800> for<00:03:27.040> us<00:03:27.100> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
really found that it's easier for us to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.960 
really found that it's easier for us to
just<00:03:27.400> do<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.990> after<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.110> fact<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
just do that after the fact the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.790 
just do that after the fact the
animators<00:03:31.360> able<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.050> knock<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.290> pose<00:03:32.620> as

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
animators able to just knock and pose as

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.830 
animators able to just knock and pose as
really<00:03:33.010> quick<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.340> stuff<00:03:33.550> we're<00:03:34.210> using<00:03:34.360> three

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
really quick and stuff we're using three
