00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.399 
couple of the pointers I would like to
point<00:02:04.250> out<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.850> when<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.930> tune<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:06.380> guitar

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
point out is when you tune your guitar

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.510 
point out is when you tune your guitar
it's<00:02:07.040> always<00:02:07.399> best

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
it's always best

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.940 
it's always best
-<00:02:10.520> -<00:02:10.729> up<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> nose<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.960> even<00:02:12.260> if<00:02:12.410> you're

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
- - up to the nose so even if you're

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.140 
- - up to the nose so even if you're
tuning<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.520> your<00:02:13.730> note<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.210> sharp

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
tuning in your note is sharp

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
tuning in your note is sharp
instead<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:16.959> tuning<00:02:17.560> down<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.489> No

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280 

by<00:02:22.280> tuning<00:02:22.730> down<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.630> want<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.170> you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
by tuning down you really want what you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.670 
by tuning down you really want what you
want<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.860> want<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:26.320> lower<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.560> no

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
want to do is you want to lower the no

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.570 
want to do is you want to lower the no
pass<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.490> can<00:02:29.060> tune<00:02:29.330> up<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.840> it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
pass that can tune up to it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
pass that can tune up to it
that's<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.820> always<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> good<00:02:33.420> practice<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.080> do

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that's just always a good practice to do

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.860 
that's just always a good practice to do
because<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.680> way<00:02:34.800> these<00:02:35.270> these<00:02:36.270> tuning

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
because the way these these tuning

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.550 
because the way these these tuning
machines<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.440> your<00:02:37.590> guitar<00:02:37.710> work<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:39.560> when

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
machines on your guitar work is when

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
machines on your guitar work is when
you're<00:02:40.710> tuning<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.610> them<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:41.820> keeping

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you're tuning up to them you're keeping

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.850 
you're tuning up to them you're keeping
pressure<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.900> tuning<00:02:43.260> peg<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:43.710> it's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
pressure on that tuning peg the way it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.040 
pressure on that tuning peg the way it's
supposed<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.670> little<00:02:45.240> work<00:02:45.840> better

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
supposed to be in the little work better

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
supposed to be in the little work better
if<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.410> tuned<00:02:46.620> down<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> work<00:02:47.730> by

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
if you tuned down to it a work by

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.880 
if you tuned down to it a work by
they'll<00:02:48.120> bow<00:02:48.300> it'll<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> lot<00:02:49.110> easier<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
they'll bow it'll be a lot easier for it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.130 
they'll bow it'll be a lot easier for it
to<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.160> out<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.310> tune<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.720> always<00:02:51.930> just

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
to go out of tune so you always just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.440 
to go out of tune so you always just
want<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:53.430> always<00:02:53.640> want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> tune<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.420> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
want to you always want to tune up to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.730 
want to you always want to tune up to
the<00:02:54.630> note<00:02:55.220> that's<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.520> always<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.880> good<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
the note that's just always a good a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.480 
the note that's just always a good a
good<00:02:58.740> practice<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.370> habit<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.730> get<00:02:59.850> into<00:03:01.490> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
good practice and habit to get into the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.460 
good practice and habit to get into the
other<00:03:02.670> tip<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.750> point<00:03:03.960> out<00:03:04.200> is

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
other tip that I'm going to point out is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.090 
other tip that I'm going to point out is
you<00:03:05.160> know<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.660> good<00:03:07.100> especially

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
you know it's really good especially

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.860 
you know it's really good especially
when<00:03:08.430> you're<00:03:08.580> performing<00:03:08.910> live<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.720> let's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
when you're performing live and let's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.750 
when you're performing live and let's
say<00:03:10.020> if<00:03:10.080> you're<00:03:10.200> using<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.130> pedal<00:03:11.430> style

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
say if you're using the the pedal style

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.300 
say if you're using the the pedal style
tuners<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.730> get<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> tuner<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.170> will<00:03:17.010> allow

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
tuners is to get a tuner that will allow

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.340 
tuners is to get a tuner that will allow
you<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.880> step<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.600> pedal<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.230> it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you when you step on that pedal that it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.790 
you when you step on that pedal that it
will<00:03:19.500> mute<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:20.040> future<00:03:20.970> signal<00:03:21.800> nobody

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
will mute that future signal nobody

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.949 
will mute that future signal nobody
wants<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> hear<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.090> stage<00:03:24.300> tuning
