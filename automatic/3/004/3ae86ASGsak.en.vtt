difficulty<00:02:04.929> can<00:02:05.140> really<00:02:05.469> be<00:02:05.619> attributed<00:02:06.189> to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
difficulty can really be attributed to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.070 
difficulty can really be attributed to
the<00:02:06.429> fact<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:06.759> you<00:02:06.909> only<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.329> one<00:02:07.569> life<00:02:07.840> in

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
the fact that you only have one life in

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.109 
the fact that you only have one life in
the<00:02:08.200> entire<00:02:08.560> game<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.160> no<00:02:09.729> matter<00:02:09.879> how<00:02:10.090> far

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
the entire game and no matter how far

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.570 
the entire game and no matter how far
you<00:02:10.539> get<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.959> always<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.830> restart<00:02:12.340> at

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
you get you always have to restart at

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.089 
you get you always have to restart at
the<00:02:12.730> opening<00:02:13.150> level<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.349> incredibly

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
the opening level it can be incredibly

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.550 
the opening level it can be incredibly
frustrating<00:02:15.370> at<00:02:15.910> times<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.720> lost<00:02:17.049> count<00:02:17.319> at

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
frustrating at times and I lost count at

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.350 
frustrating at times and I lost count at
how<00:02:17.680> many<00:02:17.860> times<00:02:18.129> I<00:02:18.370> died<00:02:18.610> while<00:02:18.879> filming<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
how many times I died while filming the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.720 
how many times I died while filming the
footage<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:19.959> review<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:23.519> lot<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
footage for this review a lot of the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.789 
footage for this review a lot of the
reason<00:02:25.090> behind<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.319> controls

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
reason behind that is that the controls

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.680 
reason behind that is that the controls
are<00:02:27.010> very<00:02:27.370> stiff<00:02:27.819> when<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> comes<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.599> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
are very stiff when it comes to the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.900 
are very stiff when it comes to the
platforming<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.829> game's<00:02:30.069> enemies<00:02:30.610> seem

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
platforming and the game's enemies seem

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.300 
platforming and the game's enemies seem
randomized<00:02:31.599> at<00:02:31.840> times<00:02:32.079> and<00:02:32.380> will<00:02:32.560> fly<00:02:32.829> in<00:02:33.040> from

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
randomized at times and will fly in from

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.759 
randomized at times and will fly in from
off<00:02:33.430> screen<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> worst<00:02:34.450> possible<00:02:34.900> moments

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
off screen at the worst possible moments

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.610 
off screen at the worst possible moments
it's<00:02:36.430> also<00:02:36.700> incredibly<00:02:37.540> easy<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.019> get<00:02:38.200> stuck

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
it's also incredibly easy to get stuck

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.589 
it's also incredibly easy to get stuck
in<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.890> loop<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:39.280> taking<00:02:39.670> damage<00:02:39.819> from<00:02:40.030> multiple

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
in a loop of taking damage from multiple

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.300 
in a loop of taking damage from multiple
enemies<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.530> will<00:02:41.680> almost<00:02:41.860> certainly

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
enemies that will almost certainly

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.569 
enemies that will almost certainly
result<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.269> game<00:02:43.450> over

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.309 

luckily<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:49.000> game's<00:02:49.239> shopping<00:02:49.840> mechanic

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
luckily the game's shopping mechanic

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.920 
luckily the game's shopping mechanic
does<00:02:50.560> ease<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.940> tension<00:02:52.180> allowing

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
does ease a bit of the tension allowing

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
does ease a bit of the tension allowing

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
too much variation in the five stages

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.659 
too much variation in the five stages
but<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.989> character<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> enemy<00:03:51.099> design<00:03:51.430> is

the thing about shadow land is that
there's<00:03:55.090> always<00:03:55.419> something<00:03:55.870> interesting<00:03:56.230> to

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
there's always something interesting to

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.410

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
big deal though since the music itself

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.850 
big deal though since the music itself
is<00:04:22.720> really<00:04:23.080> catchy<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.710> hard<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.070> forget<00:04:25.860> keep
