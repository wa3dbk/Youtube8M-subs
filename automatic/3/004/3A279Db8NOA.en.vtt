00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.590
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.880
 skeleton and this 13th part was Russian 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.279
 Maykraft City 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 on the last issue you have collected more 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.450
 translate likes it was a rights issue 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.980
 the pool here it makes me very happy a 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.290
 in fact even this is very cool well 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.130
 Come continue in the same vein set 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 Like because the more likes the more 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.520
 issues about the city 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.280
 logical so let's set like 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.739
 and we will continue to watch this video 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 Well, today's release will be about 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.699
 such a big big bank 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.870
 there is an inscription with, well, I would rather 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.530
 I wanted to throw a dollar a dollar test 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.600
 well, weâ€™ll need a little 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.370
 It was work hard and we already have how 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.130
 inscription dollar somehow I did not think it over 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.170
 Well, here we have the inscription debt is ready well and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.659
 principle, this bank is like some kind of 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.090
 Greek building there, you know 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.460
 ancient greece and so on well here we have 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.399
 the same beautiful columns still stand 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.899
 holds this design well and also 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.000
 there are four more windows in the bank 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.360
 make up for a little okay let's 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.790
 let's go inside that's such a big expense and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.829
 when we enter on meets such 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.420
 pretty corridor beautiful thought too 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.369
 here we have a ceiling such a cycle and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.130
 icover only is also available as there is 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.070
 still a table of information so much 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.810
 information mono go through it and go through 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.119
 through the guard post and then here 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.689
 it was just possible to add 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.659
 room 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.090
 there will be the light of the khan or stand and well here 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.909
 we already have this sector sells there 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.950
 does not sell but gives us information 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.670
 let's say where is some office 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 where to take a loan toyota coloring but for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.140
 visitors there are three offices well here 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.580
 this is the first study Alicia same here 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.410
 such and us a study table and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 and 241 has become for this person permissible 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.020
 which gives credit to the visitor, he 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.120
 there are also bookshelves 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 let's go out and here we have 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.830
 already a little different system here we have 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.320
 from there to the same thing the same thing 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 messed up cinco takes but that too 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.010
 the most so there is nothing interesting in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 In principle, there is no better to have such benches 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 there is a big can 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.000
 just sit down and relax or wait 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.370
 its turn also also launches 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 protection there is this room it goes nowhere 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.620
 but here we will probably have a basement that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.080
 something like that maybe the same white bunker 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.440
 horse stairs on the stairs they for 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.080
 visitors but only for staff 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.540
 Well, here are the windows 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.100
 first office but the same as office 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.880
 and here we have books like 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.020
 libraries 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.030
 but we 'll go there later and here's the second to 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.280
 a computer ticket office for us 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.830
 small here are two computers of some kind 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.080
 programmer you always lead 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.090
 something to do something I can forget though 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.230
 would put the books where there is different 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.360
 information about computers 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.480
 thirds cabinet the same 4 computers 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.300
 Well, 4 and 4 males here we have the type when 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.510
 You are director Yarin if at all in the bank 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.550
 director but let us banks it will be 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.070
 state bank what such 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.989
 normal bank here we have a flower table and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.450
 two books I do not know what the director so 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.720
 that let it be so let's 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.180
 look at that room drags or come to a 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.120
 storage hrenishi where to keep money there 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.730
 huge savings expensive 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.370
 he will be let in there by a guard sitting armed 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.680
 the core of the page dr will burn and such some 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 strong spill well and here in principle even 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.200
 mono camera put this type of camera 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.690
 because everything is so important is important for some reason 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.390
 here and I could put a camera 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.930
 Daddy we go there we have very very 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.810
 many chests they are actually empty 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.610
 they found empty but so such 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.060
 Diamond means that the type should 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.890
 stored diamonds stored 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.680
 ridiculous said it should crap with 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.960
 diamond kept later swallowed with this 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.570
 word shorter there should be diamonds 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.430
 Well, I indicated the whole bank but with you 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.230
