hello<00:00:01.129> today<00:00:02.129> we're<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.610> looking<00:00:02.790> at

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hello today we're going to be looking at

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.600 
hello today we're going to be looking at
wiring<00:00:03.659> up<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.990> simple<00:00:04.410> solenoid<00:00:05.279> valve<00:00:06.170> the

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
wiring up a simple solenoid valve the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.640 
wiring up a simple solenoid valve the
whole<00:00:08.610> raiga<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.150> shown<00:00:09.420> later<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.559> right

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
whole raiga be shown later but for right

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.339 
whole raiga be shown later but for right
now<00:00:10.710> let's<00:00:11.130> start<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> circuit<00:00:12.349> it's

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
now let's start with the circuit it's

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.900 
now let's start with the circuit it's
going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.769> pretty<00:00:14.190> simple<00:00:14.549> you're

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
going to be pretty simple you're

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.090 
going to be pretty simple you're
basically<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> use<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> digital<00:00:16.320> pin<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
basically going to use a digital pin to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.640 
basically going to use a digital pin to
turn<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.090> relay<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.650> started<00:00:20.130> first

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
turn on relay so let's get started first

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.490 
turn on relay so let's get started first
thing<00:00:22.650> we're<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.119> connect<00:00:24.689> power

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
thing we're going to do is connect power

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.009 
thing we're going to do is connect power
and<00:00:25.859> ground<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.580> our<00:00:26.730> Arduino<00:00:27.449> board<00:00:27.810> I'm

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and ground from our Arduino board I'm

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
and ground from our Arduino board I'm
using<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:29.119> Arduino<00:00:30.170> micro<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:32.329> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
using the Arduino micro for this so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
using the Arduino micro for this so
we'll<00:00:33.540> run<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.829> reel<00:00:35.130> from<00:00:36.920> power<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.550> then

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we'll run one reel from power and then

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
we'll run one reel from power and then
let's<00:00:39.780> add<00:00:40.079> another<00:00:40.110> wire<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.520> connect<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:43.040> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
let's add another wire to connect the to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.220 
let's add another wire to connect the to
ground<00:00:48.860> next<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.610> need<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.000> add<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.750> for

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ground next we need to add a line for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430 
ground next we need to add a line for
our<00:00:52.440> digital<00:00:53.039> i/o<00:00:53.840> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
our digital i/o I'm going to use the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
our digital i/o I'm going to use the
other<00:00:55.680> side<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> board<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> doesn't

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
other side of the board so it doesn't

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
other side of the board so it doesn't
become<00:00:57.690> too<00:00:58.940> too<00:00:59.940> cluttered<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.989> we'll<00:01:01.170> place

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
become too too cluttered so we'll place

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
become too too cluttered so we'll place
this<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> go

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this this line is actually going to go

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.160 
this this line is actually going to go
into<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:04.939> transistor<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.750> BJT<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.170> what

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
into a transistor or BJT and so what

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
into a transistor or BJT and so what
we'll<00:01:10.350> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.369> add<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
we'll want to do is actually add a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.920 
we'll want to do is actually add a
resistor<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> we'll<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.930> 1k

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
resistor for this also so we'll use a 1k

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.230 
resistor for this also so we'll use a 1k
resistor<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.100> match<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.290> base<00:01:19.290> current<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
resistor to match the base current to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.010 
resistor to match the base current to
what<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> specs<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.799> particular

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
what to the specs for this particular

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
what to the specs for this particular
BJT<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.450> are<00:01:27.990> ready<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> add<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.790> BJT<00:01:31.880> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
BJT now we are ready to add the BJT so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.800 
BJT now we are ready to add the BJT so
the<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.530> pin<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.880> emitter<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the first pin on here is the emitter the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.520 
the first pin on here is the emitter the
second<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.950> base<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.150> third<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
second is the base and the third is the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.960 
second is the base and the third is the
collector<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> start<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.140> by

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
collector so we're going to start off by

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.240 
collector so we're going to start off by
connecting<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.530> emitter<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.159> ground<00:01:49.250> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
connecting our emitter to ground so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.289 
connecting our emitter to ground so
we'll<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.700> real<00:01:51.390> quick<00:01:52.850> next<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
we'll do that real quick next we want to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.889 
we'll do that real quick next we want to
make<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.509> connection<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.320> our<00:01:55.439> base<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> base

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
make a connection to our base the base

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
make a connection to our base the base
on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.159> transistor<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.490> second<00:02:02.490> pin<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
on the transistor is the second pin in

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
on the transistor is the second pin in
as<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.880> our<00:02:06.030> first<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:07.550> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
as you can see so as our first was a the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.540 
as you can see so as our first was a the
emitter<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.929> second<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.039> base<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
emitter the second one is the base and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.620 
emitter the second one is the base and
the<00:02:12.239> third

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the third

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.590 
the third
is<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.610> collector<00:02:15.410> make<00:02:16.410> sure<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> use<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
is the collector make sure you use a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.990 
is the collector make sure you use a
resistor<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.830> actually<00:02:19.830> limit<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> current

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
resistor to actually limit the current

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.900 
resistor to actually limit the current
that<00:02:21.360> goes<00:02:21.420> into<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.110> base<00:02:22.310> otherwise<00:02:23.310> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
that goes into the base otherwise you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.670 
that goes into the base otherwise you
could<00:02:24.150> end<00:02:24.920> up<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.190> frying<00:02:26.990> your<00:02:27.990> device<00:02:28.320> which

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
could end up a frying your device which

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.330 
could end up a frying your device which
is<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.790> something<00:02:30.210> probably<00:02:30.480> want<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.780> do

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
is not something probably want to do

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.720 
is not something probably want to do
some<00:02:32.510> kind<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.570> straighten<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.020> things<00:02:34.730> here

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
some kind of straighten out things here

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.940 
some kind of straighten out things here
and<00:02:36.180> let's<00:02:36.960> move<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:39.510> right<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:39.990> let's<00:02:40.200> add

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and let's move on all right so let's add

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370 
and let's move on all right so let's add
our<00:02:41.010> diode<00:02:41.550> we're<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.300> take<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.930> diode

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
our diode we're going to take the diode

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.320 
our diode we're going to take the diode
from<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.750> collector<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.610> supply<00:02:48.000> rail

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
from the collector to the supply rail

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.920 
from the collector to the supply rail
and<00:02:48.740> we're<00:02:49.740> doing<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:51.450> there<00:02:51.780> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and we're doing this so that if there is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.180 
and we're doing this so that if there is
any<00:02:52.910> voltage<00:02:53.910> spike<00:02:54.540> when<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.470> disconnect

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
any voltage spike when we disconnect

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.090 
any voltage spike when we disconnect
from<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.360> coil<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> relay<00:02:58.320> it'll<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.890> fed

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
from the coil of the relay it'll be fed

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.950 
from the coil of the relay it'll be fed
through<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.520> diode<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.330> through<00:03:00.720> our

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
through this diode and that through our

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.130 
through this diode and that through our
transistor<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.820> let's<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.080> our<00:03:04.620> relay<00:03:06.140> be

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
transistor so let's now and our relay be

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.760 
transistor so let's now and our relay be
hard<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.890> tell<00:03:08.220> from<00:03:09.260> well<00:03:10.260> from<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> video

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
hard to tell from well from the video

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.050 
hard to tell from well from the video
but<00:03:11.240> this<00:03:12.240> relay<00:03:12.660> has<00:03:12.960> two<00:03:13.590> different

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
but this relay has two different

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.020 
but this relay has two different
contexts<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.300> each<00:03:15.480> side<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.030> basically

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
contexts on each side and so basically

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.530 
contexts on each side and so basically
you<00:03:18.720> control<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:20.040> control<00:03:20.210> two<00:03:21.210> switches

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
you control you can control two switches

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.420 
you control you can control two switches
with<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.080> we're<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.710> going<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.040> use<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
with this we're just going to use the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.070 
with this we're just going to use the
one<00:03:23.610> side<00:03:24.470> but<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.830> want<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.730> run<00:03:27.720> a

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
one side but what we want to do is run a

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.830 
one side but what we want to do is run a
line<00:03:28.950> from<00:03:29.670> our<00:03:30.090> supply<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:32.270> one<00:03:33.270> side<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
line from our supply to one side of the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.590 
line from our supply to one side of the
relay<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:35.340> has<00:03:35.490> got<00:03:35.610> one<00:03:35.790> connection<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
relay it has got one connection to the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.080 
relay it has got one connection to the
coils<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.410> then<00:03:37.500> we're<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.860> run<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
coils and then we're going to run the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.660 
coils and then we're going to run the
other<00:03:39.360> side<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.610> relay<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.670> collector

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
other side of the relay to the collector

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.790 
other side of the relay to the collector
of<00:03:45.000> our<00:03:45.180> BJT<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.510> we've<00:03:49.050> made<00:03:49.320> this

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
of our BJT so now that we've made this

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.390 
of our BJT so now that we've made this
connection<00:03:50.190> our<00:03:50.700> circuit<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.360> all<00:03:51.810> but

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
connection our circuit is all but

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.420 
connection our circuit is all but
complete<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:54.270> next<00:03:54.570> thing<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:55.230> need<00:03:55.530> add<00:03:56.010> is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
complete the next thing we need add is

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.010 
complete the next thing we need add is
the<00:03:56.790> power<00:03:57.480> supply<00:03:57.780> for<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:59.720> solenoid<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
the power supply for the solenoid and

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.890 
the power supply for the solenoid and
that<00:04:01.470> actually<00:04:01.800> runs<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.190> runs<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.060> 12<00:04:03.450> volts

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that actually runs it runs on 12 volts

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.740 
that actually runs it runs on 12 volts
so<00:04:04.709> I'm<00:04:04.800> going<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.040> use<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> wall<00:04:06.060> work<00:04:06.390> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
so I'm going to use a wall work to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.140 
so I'm going to use a wall work to
actually<00:04:07.230> power<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.520> little

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
actually power that I have a little

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.860 
actually power that I have a little
barrel<00:04:09.810> Jack<00:04:10.520> adapter<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.760> kind<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.660> put

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
barrel Jack adapter that I kind of put

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.170 
barrel Jack adapter that I kind of put
together<00:04:13.430> we're<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.580> going<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.760> run<00:04:14.970> these

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
together we're just going to run these

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.090 
together we're just going to run these
two<00:04:16.220> wires<00:04:17.220> power<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.120> ground<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.920> other

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
two wires power and ground to the other

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.780 
two wires power and ground to the other
side<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.729> our<00:04:20.880> proto<00:04:21.840> board<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.340> will<00:04:23.520> just

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
side of our proto board so we will just

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.600 
side of our proto board so we will just
plug<00:04:24.660> those<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:25.140> right<00:04:25.830> here

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
plug those in right here

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.779 
plug those in right here
so<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.840> last<00:04:28.080> thing<00:04:28.379> we<00:04:28.590> need<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:29.069> do<00:04:29.280> on<00:04:29.759> our

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
so the last thing we need to do on our

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.320 
so the last thing we need to do on our
breadboard<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.750> connect<00:04:31.379> the<00:04:31.789> common<00:04:32.789> line<00:04:33.000> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
breadboard is connect the common line of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.379 
breadboard is connect the common line of
the<00:04:33.539> relay<00:04:34.819> to<00:04:35.819> our<00:04:35.969> ground<00:04:36.569> connection<00:04:38.389> the

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
the relay to our ground connection the

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.300 
the relay to our ground connection the
other<00:04:40.020> connections<00:04:40.680> we're<00:04:40.860> going<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.039> use

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
other connections we're going to use

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.899 
other connections we're going to use
well<00:04:41.669> I'm<00:04:41.909> just<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> actually<00:04:43.259> use<00:04:43.319> a

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
well I'm just going to actually use a

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.629 
well I'm just going to actually use a
alligator<00:04:44.909> clips<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.659> run<00:04:46.219> to<00:04:47.219> run<00:04:47.250> those

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
alligator clips to run to run those

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.640 
alligator clips to run to run those
lines<00:04:47.939> just<00:04:48.360> because<00:04:48.629> and<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.229> really<00:04:49.439> have<00:04:49.590> a

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
lines just because and I really have a

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.249 
lines just because and I really have a
place<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.430> put<00:04:50.939> the<00:04:51.090> board<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.050> gonna

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
place to put the board so it's gonna

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.320 
place to put the board so it's gonna
have<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.650> be<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.889> little<00:04:53.099> bit<00:04:53.250> further<00:04:54.090> away

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
have to be a little bit further away

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.469 
have to be a little bit further away
from<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.870> solenoid<00:04:55.139> um<00:04:55.710> but<00:04:56.699> now<00:04:56.939> let's<00:04:57.270> take

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
from the solenoid um but now let's take

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.790 
from the solenoid um but now let's take
a<00:04:57.509> look<00:04:57.719> at<00:04:57.930> our<00:04:58.110> entire<00:04:58.610> rig<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.680> basically<00:05:01.680> I

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
a look at our entire rig and basically I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.320 
a look at our entire rig and basically I
just<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:02.069> this<00:05:02.190> little<00:05:02.370> noise<00:05:02.610> hooked<00:05:02.909> up<00:05:03.090> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
just have this little noise hooked up to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.469 
just have this little noise hooked up to
a<00:05:03.949> water<00:05:04.949> source<00:05:05.280> that's<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.879> bottle<00:05:06.270> and

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
a water source that's just a bottle and

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.320 
a water source that's just a bottle and
we<00:05:06.719> just<00:05:06.900> want<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.229> see<00:05:07.379> if<00:05:07.469> we<00:05:07.500> can<00:05:07.740> turn<00:05:07.949> on

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
we just want to see if we can turn on

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.089 
we just want to see if we can turn on
the<00:05:09.330> solenoid<00:05:09.599> and<00:05:09.960> have<00:05:10.789> water<00:05:11.789> flow<00:05:12.270> from

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
the solenoid and have water flow from

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.570 
the solenoid and have water flow from
the<00:05:14.099> bottle<00:05:14.460> into<00:05:14.639> this<00:05:15.180> coffee<00:05:15.479> mug<00:05:16.159> so<00:05:17.159> let's

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
the bottle into this coffee mug so let's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.450 
the bottle into this coffee mug so let's
hook<00:05:18.180> hook<00:05:18.900> up<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.289> rest<00:05:19.500> of<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.069> see<00:05:20.340> if

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
hook hook up the rest of this and see if

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.019 
hook hook up the rest of this and see if
we<00:05:20.639> can<00:05:20.849> accomplish<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:23.550> here's<00:05:23.909> a

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
we can accomplish that so here's a

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.890 
we can accomplish that so here's a
bird's<00:05:25.020> eye<00:05:25.259> view<00:05:25.289> of<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:26.279> circuit<00:05:26.879> that<00:05:27.060> will

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
bird's eye view of the circuit that will

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.439 
bird's eye view of the circuit that will
make<00:05:28.259> the<00:05:28.800> solenoid<00:05:29.340> run<00:05:30.529> so<00:05:31.529> I<00:05:32.389> think<00:05:33.389> I

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
make the solenoid run so I think I

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.080 
make the solenoid run so I think I
misspoke<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.139> said<00:05:34.349> that<00:05:34.529> we<00:05:34.650> had<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.279> common

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
misspoke and said that we had the common

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.230 
misspoke and said that we had the common
connection<00:05:36.629> to<00:05:36.870> ground<00:05:37.139> it's<00:05:37.919> actually<00:05:38.580> to

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
connection to ground it's actually to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.980 
connection to ground it's actually to
the<00:05:39.599> 12-volt<00:05:40.080> power<00:05:40.379> supply<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:42.150> those<00:05:42.779> are

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
the 12-volt power supply and those are

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.760 
the 12-volt power supply and those are
the<00:05:43.139> connections<00:05:43.680> on<00:05:44.009> the<00:05:44.430> sill<00:05:45.000> annoyed<00:05:45.770> but

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
the connections on the sill annoyed but

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.189 
the connections on the sill annoyed but
now<00:05:47.009> let's<00:05:47.520> see<00:05:47.759> if<00:05:47.849> we<00:05:47.909> can<00:05:48.180> hear<00:05:48.479> it<00:05:48.569> run<00:05:48.870> um

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
now let's see if we can hear it run um

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.339 
now let's see if we can hear it run um
I'm<00:05:49.740> just<00:05:49.919> going<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.190> use<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.430> modified<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.349> blink

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
I'm just going to use a modified a blink

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.869 
I'm just going to use a modified a blink
program<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:54.419> we<00:05:54.810> should<00:05:55.080> hear<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:56.460> relay

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
program and we should hear the relay

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.820 
program and we should hear the relay
opening<00:05:57.629> and<00:05:57.839> closing<00:05:58.349> it'll<00:05:58.620> make<00:05:58.800> a

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
opening and closing it'll make a

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:18.990 
opening and closing it'll make a
distinct<00:05:59.729> switching<00:06:00.240> sound

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.870 

as<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:21.139> can<00:06:21.290> see<00:06:21.530> we<00:06:22.010> don't<00:06:22.160> have<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.400> really

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
as you can see we don't have a really

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.730 
as you can see we don't have a really
good<00:06:23.180> flow<00:06:24.400> turns<00:06:25.400> out<00:06:25.610> that<00:06:25.790> this<00:06:26.350> valve<00:06:27.350> is

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
good flow turns out that this valve is

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.370 
good flow turns out that this valve is
rated<00:06:28.310> for<00:06:28.490> higher<00:06:28.729> pressure<00:06:29.180> than<00:06:29.570> what<00:06:30.350> I

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
rated for higher pressure than what I

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.879 
rated for higher pressure than what I
can<00:06:30.740> provide<00:06:31.220> with<00:06:31.820> the<00:06:32.360> set<00:06:32.570> up<00:06:32.660> ahead<00:06:33.020> but

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
can provide with the set up ahead but

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.890 
can provide with the set up ahead but
you<00:06:34.160> can<00:06:34.370> hear<00:06:34.580> that<00:06:34.820> water<00:06:35.060> does<00:06:35.360> run<00:06:35.660> when

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
you can hear that water does run when

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.969 
you can hear that water does run when
you<00:06:36.080> turn<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.889> valve<00:06:37.130> on<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.960> thanks<00:06:39.860> for

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
you turn the valve on so thanks for

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.730 
you turn the valve on so thanks for
watching<00:06:40.430> check<00:06:41.210> out<00:06:41.360> my<00:06:41.600> website<00:06:41.930> for<00:06:42.169> more
