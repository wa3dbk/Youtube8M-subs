tear the whole thing out I'm gonna tear
it<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.739> because<00:02:22.889> I<00:02:23.190> don't<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.239> how<00:02:24.420> it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
takes off goes for me and I think that's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.690

so next thing has a removable root guard
which<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.560> pretty<00:02:42.739> good

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.770 

the<00:02:45.560> aerospace<00:02:46.160> shell<00:02:46.550> design<00:02:46.970> creates<00:02:47.570> the

aerospace technology for aerodynamics

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.190 
aerospace technology for aerodynamics
and<00:02:51.470> strength<00:02:52.240> which<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.390> pretty<00:02:53.780> good

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and strength which is pretty good

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.540 
and strength which is pretty good
fasting<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:55.510> has<00:02:56.510> their<00:02:56.900> world-famous

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
fasting it has their world-famous

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.600 
fasting it has their world-famous
graphics<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.230> it<00:03:00.230> exceeds<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:01.100> safety

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
graphics and it exceeds the safety

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.690 
graphics and it exceeds the safety

approval ratings for CSP see ASTM and
see<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.120> think<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.600> got<00:03:08.780> all<00:03:08.960> those<00:03:09.170> right

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
see I think I got all those right

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.230 
see I think I got all those right
and<00:03:10.460> so<00:03:11.110> I'll<00:03:12.110> put<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.470> on<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.920> guys<00:03:13.240> I've

yeah<00:03:32.270> so<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.599> fits<00:03:32.840> good<00:03:33.200> nice<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:33.890> snug<00:03:34.040> this

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
yeah so it fits good nice and snug this

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.780 
yeah so it fits good nice and snug this
is<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> medium<00:03:35.599> /<00:03:36.019> large<00:03:36.470> which<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
is a medium / large which is the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.640 
is a medium / large which is the
diameter<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.989> person<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.440> has<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.800> head<00:03:40.099> of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
diameter for a person that has a head of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.600 
diameter for a person that has a head of
56<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.980> 59<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.629> think<00:03:44.840> I'm<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> 58<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.069> it<00:03:46.370> fits

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
56 to 59 and I think I'm a 58 so it fits

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750 
56 to 59 and I think I'm a 58 so it fits
it's<00:03:47.510> pretty<00:03:47.780> snug<00:03:47.900> but<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.769> not<00:03:49.459> too<00:03:49.700> snug

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
it's pretty snug but it's not too snug

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's pretty snug but it's not too snug
which<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.420> it's<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.989> perfect<00:03:51.230> fit<00:03:51.790> another

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
which is it's the perfect fit another

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.030 
which is it's the perfect fit another
nice<00:03:53.060> thing<00:03:53.090> about<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.690> Scott<00:03:54.230> huge<00:03:54.709> ear

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
nice thing about this Scott huge ear

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.949 
nice thing about this Scott huge ear
holes<00:03:55.310> for<00:03:55.610> me<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.940> don't<00:03:56.690> know<00:03:56.750> how<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
holes for me I don't know how the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.350 
holes for me I don't know how the
clarity<00:03:57.709> is<00:03:57.830> talking<00:03:58.580> through<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> mesh<00:03:59.060> but

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
clarity is talking through the mesh but

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.979 
clarity is talking through the mesh but
guess<00:04:00.170> we'll<00:04:00.349> find<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.860> but<00:04:01.160> yeah<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.720> got

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
guess we'll find it but yeah it's got

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.240 
guess we'll find it but yeah it's got
your<00:04:03.230> your<00:04:03.980> strap<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.470> visor<00:04:06.709> doesn't<00:04:07.130> get

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
your your strap the visor doesn't get

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.430 
your your strap the visor doesn't get
into<00:04:07.580> much<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.180> for<00:04:08.480> visibility<00:04:09.290> and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
into much in the way for visibility and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.059 
into much in the way for visibility and
all<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:09.769> it's<00:04:10.280> got<00:04:10.549> good<00:04:10.790> movement<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.769> it's

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
all that it's got good movement and it's

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.319 
all that it's got good movement and it's
Oh<00:04:14.110> put<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.700> second<00:04:18.579> one<00:04:19.579> of<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.790> extremely

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
Oh put the second one of the extremely

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.960 
Oh put the second one of the extremely
nice<00:04:20.630> things<00:04:20.959> about<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.760> don't<00:04:22.760> know<00:04:22.820> if<00:04:22.910> I

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
nice things about I don't know if I

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.350 
nice things about I don't know if I
mentioned<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.450> but<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:23.810> fully<00:04:24.290> carbon<00:04:24.830> I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
mentioned this but it's fully carbon I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.850 
mentioned this but it's fully carbon I
don't<00:04:26.360> think<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.600> did<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:26.960> if<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.500> did<00:04:27.680> I'm

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
don't think I did but if I did I'm

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.909 
don't think I did but if I did I'm
repeating<00:04:28.669> myself<00:04:28.850> but<00:04:29.360> anyways<00:04:29.800> one<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
repeating myself but anyways one of the

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.250 
repeating myself but anyways one of the
nice<00:04:31.070> things<00:04:31.100> about<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.810> really

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
nice things about it is that it's really

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.700 
nice things about it is that it's really
light<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:34.070> normally<00:04:35.139> your<00:04:36.139> helmets<00:04:36.560> are

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
light like normally your helmets are

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.110 
light like normally your helmets are
probably<00:04:37.060> running

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
probably running

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.619 
probably running
three<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.300> four<00:04:40.539> pounds<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:41.680> guessing

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
three to four pounds just guessing

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.850 
three to four pounds just guessing
approximately<00:04:43.629> for<00:04:43.840> like<00:04:43.960> an<00:04:44.080> okay<00:04:44.470> helmet

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
approximately for like an okay helmet

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.820 
approximately for like an okay helmet
but<00:04:45.009> this<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.990> probably<00:04:47.319> about<00:04:48.750> two<00:04:49.750> or<00:04:50.080> two

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
but this is probably about two or two

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.430 
but this is probably about two or two
and<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.039> half<00:04:51.280> at<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.580> most<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.259> it's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
and a half at the most and so it's

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.820 
and a half at the most and so it's
really<00:04:53.650> uh<00:04:53.800> really<00:04:55.110> light<00:04:56.110> on<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.409> head<00:04:56.620> you

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
really uh really light on the head you

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.559 
really uh really light on the head you
don't<00:04:56.949> half<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.699> time<00:04:57.879> but<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.150> first<00:04:58.300> time<00:04:58.509> I

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
don't half the time but the first time I

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.869 
don't half the time but the first time I
put<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.810> on<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.440> well<00:05:00.159> the<00:05:00.550> funny<00:05:00.789> thing

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
put it on in you well the funny thing

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.430 
put it on in you well the funny thing
was<00:05:01.150> when<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.479> picked<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.810> out<00:05:01.900> from<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.199> post

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
was when I picked it out from the post

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.339 
was when I picked it out from the post
office<00:05:02.889> in<00:05:03.370> mind<00:05:03.639> in<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:03.970> box<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.599> thought

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
office in mind in the box I thought

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.050 
office in mind in the box I thought
there<00:05:05.800> was<00:05:05.889> nothing<00:05:06.009> in<00:05:06.310> there<00:05:06.520> well<00:05:06.849> there

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
there was nothing in there well there

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.490 
there was nothing in there well there
was<00:05:07.270> something<00:05:07.599> in<00:05:07.810> there<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.080> was<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.199> little

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
was something in there it was a little

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.339 
was something in there it was a little
bit<00:05:08.680> heavy<00:05:08.919> but<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.509> could<00:05:10.509> hardly<00:05:10.690> feel<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.110> and

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
bit heavy but I could hardly feel it and

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.300 
bit heavy but I could hardly feel it and
so<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.590> was<00:05:11.849> hopeful<00:05:12.849> he<00:05:13.000> didn't<00:05:13.300> scam<00:05:13.659> me<00:05:13.900> and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
so I was hopeful he didn't scam me and
