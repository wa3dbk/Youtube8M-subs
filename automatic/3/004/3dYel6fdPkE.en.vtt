00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.930
 of the world 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.730
 the world and both world options 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.990
 now that we have the seed the thirst of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.880
 all of life and then we have 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.710
 the gene structures that was already in the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.890
 previous version 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.149
 and here we have good news 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.110

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.660
 put big biomes that is nothing else 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.420

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.290
 deserts the snow the forest those things 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.510
 they are much bigger 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.670
 then we have to allow or not tricks that 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.580
 would be to carry the chat on single 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.860
 player to put that moody everything 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.630
 other than let's see how it works and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.640
 good the bonus chest that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.460
 will start or not we will try 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.130
 on and going to see what is good 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.399
 let's put him 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.620
 The name school minecraft 1.3 point 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.080
 one and we're going to create good world 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.540
 we wait for us to generate the land and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.330
 now going to see what Hood to the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.870
 what did I mean? 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.760
 well the chest is this simply 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.420
 want to start we have a chest with 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.030
 basic objects such as wood 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.760
 Axes and picks and this is good for 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.090
 start the micro right we can garros 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.090
 the chest 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.730
 and the environments 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.000
 well we would start with what you see here 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.560
 a chest with cakes for wood 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.459
 peaks and already back 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 well what else do we have here besides the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.970
 jets that simply that we help him to 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.800
 now we can talk to you 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.640
 and if we put a help bar, we get the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.210
 page number 1 that we have help 2 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.220
 space 22 on page 2 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.480
 here we have good the game mode in the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.480
 what can we put and mod 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:47.880
 12 or I think 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.880
 well we have the 0 which is the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.700
 the survival the one that is the creative and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.460
 the two that is an adventure mode that does not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 it lets us break blocks but it's called 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.390
 animals and so on but when this 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.640
 mode is in development if you see it at 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.220
 notes of the patch because it looks like it's still 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.290
 in which they are finishing 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.970
 well then we have the one of a lifetime and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.810
 my object we could put a stone and 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.730
 Lets put 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.340
 22 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.510
 is needed by the name we have then the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.420
 my name a stone and 12 and we 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.850
 they would leave then 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.890
 then stones 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.480
 something quite useful then we have in case 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.540
 you do not want to install the quantum in items 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.489
 what 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.469
 I what most like to take it try 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.030
 here and that does not take out automatically 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.550
 because we also do not know the ideas of 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.980
 memory then it did not take out automatically 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.720
 of these objects is more practical in your 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.540
 mind from my point of view 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.970
 then the time bonus to put time set 0 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.780
 we will put it to the first of the morning 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.980
 718 thousand times we put it at night 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.060
 report players give experience 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.250
 good useful commands 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.709
 this is the new chest that has been 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.720
 implemented with this version the chest 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.090
 from the end that now I'm going to show you how 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.590
 it's good, the first thing we're doing 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 a poster table 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.940
 and do the following we need 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.090
 objects three objects that this is what 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.090
 daily 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.220
 this amount of obsidian blocks the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.850
 pearl of leander that I know 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.230
 has killing ndr mans and the bar 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.840
 flaming they get in hell 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.610
 throwing the blades good 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.520
 but what do we have to do to 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.139
 get the flame powder 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 and now place a flame powder here 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.169
 and the pearl to get the eye of 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.449
 sell the eye to sell in the center 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.050
 We would place it around and it gives us the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.560
 coffer of the good emder that is what 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.610
 peculiarity has this good chest what 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.479
 first that serves 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.129
 what gets between this chest is 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.649
 let's say that 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.300
 Do not put in a chest or others always go 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.800
 to have the same space is to say yes 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.739
 we put stone we are going to put him like this 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.050
 example will be the same in the same 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:22.479
 chest we take out stone here is going to come out of the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.439
 another chest if you destroy we have both 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.330
 chests the stones will not come out as 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:31.180
 it happens if we break 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 what are the normal values ​​but what 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.229
 they are going to stay inside until 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.990
 let's put a chest and then we get out 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.680
 what's inside this good as I said in 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.030
 the little review that I did with this 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.800
 It will be very useful to put a chest in 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.910
 the house and another the mine and put spending 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.680
 the objects to avoid losing them 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:55.060
 situations that washed those things 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.350
 good to remove this chest 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.550
 it takes an enchanted peak with a 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.960
 special enchantment because if not 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.420
 the next thing happens besides we're going 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.020
 to take a little 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.280
 let's give rusty babies as you see 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.710
 now I will break the other one also for 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.320
 that you see that the stone that I put in is not going to 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.370
 go out 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.370
 however if I take the chest again and 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.550
 I put it, we have the same stone inside 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.550
 I was in the other way 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.280
 good to make the new book of 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.880
 to write we need first of all reeds 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.340
 of sugar and good leather with the cannes of 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.320
 sugar then in this way we get the 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.510
 paper and put then placing the paper 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.760
 whether so 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.280
 that is, placing it in any way 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.550
 between three of paper and rope equal the 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.620
 arrangement as you see gives us then a 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.420
 three paper book and one leather in the 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.220
 book and now placing the book too 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.470
 in any way and placing a pen 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.950
 and ink us from the book as you see it does not matter 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.830
 The disposition 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.630
 gives us the pen book good how 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.290
 the book and pen simply works 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:10.020
 We want to give you what we want to do during the day 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.390

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:17.280

 with the 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.310
 thing of enchantments and as you can see 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.140
