00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 go over the center half and yes 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.389
 Here Sorokin intercept look there is 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.889
 he has a chance and give it away but he does in 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.640
 general in its phase but again its 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.119
 nyak during everything I did , and here it is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.580
 it was truly dangerous this most 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.330
 dangerous moment for the whole first to i 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 looked in an intensifying style in such 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.450
 Ukrainians worked and then you know pizza 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 so diagonally such a trapezoid and there 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.079
 at the far corner the sorokin should have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.640
 to hammer 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.090
 give now and now there is a goal 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.040
 Ukraine 10 is still sorokin third 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.040
 attempts scoring this distract with 5 errors 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.100
 look again 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 romania get stuck in their half with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 ball draws covers 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.100
 they are covering the ruler of the ball 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.289
 we lacked some such 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 intelligibly stich either in actions 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:30.960
 Mota from gave me somehow not very comfortable 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.319
 and notice nothing attack choked a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.360
 Now here is the same thing that happened in 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.929
 the first half that's all exactly the same 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 again mata and mistaken heavy he him 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.310
 selects the ball ovsyannikov in the final 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 stage so the groups are small total 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 only after team matches in general 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.849
 it turns out each team is mean 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.909
 The moment is that now it was a repeat 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.340
 and the feeling was that vanya prince 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.520
 close up that he got in my frame 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.280
 well, no shit good combination no 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.720
 the ball just hit the crossbar not 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 goalkeeper reached out 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.150
 but I didn’t have enough for the sword 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.190
 10 centimeters can be gone 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.580
 last 5 minutes to this beauty we 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.140
 yesterday watched the mafia transfer 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.880
 no no this is vanya 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.920
 but it seems to me very well 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.850
 felt 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.580
 attack geometry but here it is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.730
 look man with such growth with 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.850
 such a weight performs just Brazilian 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.500
 feints beats like look from 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 technically how are you vibrators and went and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.630
 went on the attack here are one diameters not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.920
 meanwhile followed 4 minutes exactly 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.890
 to the end and one more thing and what is 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.820
 but now it’s not lucky 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 luck is not farmer four points for two 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 match they 3 you see yes not scoop 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.500
 we can say but how it turned out to
