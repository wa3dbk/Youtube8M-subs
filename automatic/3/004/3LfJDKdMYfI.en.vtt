00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680
 I hope you are very well here 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.200
 continuing with the tutorials of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.690
 galaxy 6 we are going to partition our 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 external internal memory the card 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.299
 memory to increase the memory of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.060
 our device is very easy 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.410
 requirements are very basic was rolled 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.170
 in this galaxy 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.440
 serrot have the chloroform installed 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.000
 and have a memory of 2 or 4 gigabytes 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.400
 depending on the capacity that you 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.349
 want to have partition in this case 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.800
 I have 2 leagues so there is a partition 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.989
 of 512 how much is the most that is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.879
 recommends doing as you already have 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.489
 tightened by some other galaxy is that you 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.980
 before and the most that can stand are 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.260
 512 you stay in a position of denial and 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.960
 are crazy to put the application is like 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.559
 if it were the edmans galaxies that I bring 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.080
 81.8 gigas will be very encouraged 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.570
 and they will end up pulling they do not know 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.820
 him in his eyes because that happened to me 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.740
 how slow it was but they can not 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.300
 sign a phone in this category that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.450
 it's only 800 megabytes 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.280
 another annotation endorse everything that 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 have on your memory card since 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.780
 this knowledge will eliminate everything in 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.390
 general all the files like music 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.390
 images videos back up in your 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.550
 computer so they do not lose any 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 file since this process will lose 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.950
 all and once having both 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 annotations let's restart the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.740
 recovery 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740
 so let's turn off the device 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.790
 we go to first key combination 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 power and home at the same time for 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.470
 access our recovery mode 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.149
 ready here they are forming the recovery 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.900
 we are going to occupy the option that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.000
 says advanced 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.060
 and we go forward but on issues in which 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.220
 that partition sd card 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.560
 here select an amount that you 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 have on your card that you want 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.940
 I the most is to say that they want all 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.270
 and it's the most that the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.880
 phone assigns much encouragement and this one 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.550
 you get the 2 gigas the 4 gigas that is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.019
 exaggeratedly they will encourage too much their 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.700
 device so I recommend you 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.730
 only 512 is the maximum and where it says 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.319
 it's cool if you give it 0 and it's going to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.319
 start partitioning ok 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.969
 in this way we will be able to have this 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.230
 memory pressed and in a following 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.909
 video I will show you how to 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.909
 partition to this same stock branch 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.780
 to have this memory increase 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.110
 those people who do not want to use their 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.799
 do not want to update or naron based on 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.049
 windows 7 or cyanogenmod 9 and they want 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.540
 keep this rom to stoke good there is a 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.940
 way to increase your memory using these 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.239
 512 megas that I just got that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.040
 partition 'we will not use that 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.739
 procedure to expand that memory 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.900
 internal is in this commission well here 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.540
 just finished let's give the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.129
 reebok system or the first option and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.129
 ready to restart us 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.460
 no problem 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.470
 we are going to finish the island 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.400
 and today is the start of the device that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.050
 we think well here is because today 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.870
 started and we're going to check our 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.080
 internal memory in this case had a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.350
 memory of 2 gb approximately 1.8 is 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.260
 what remains the closer must stay 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.740
 1.37 gigas approximately mind with 1.8 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.560
 minus the 512 that was taken away that was 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.080
 1.37 and in this way and memory 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.310
 internal is 157 megabytes in the next 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.920
 I'm going to show you how to increase the video 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.050
 This space available 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.480
 using the partition that was done right now 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.880
 very well I hope you liked it if 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.350
 you liked to give a little hand up all 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.240
 the archives told him to be here 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.580
 down on the description good more than 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.160
 nothing file this close if it is not going to 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.020
 be the video tutorial of how to draw 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.600
 install the club for no recovery here 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.880
 down will that video be nothing more 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.570
 arriving a little bit lost I hope that 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.180
 you liked it 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.180
 until the next bye
