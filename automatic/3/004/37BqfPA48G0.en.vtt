00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.480 

to<00:01:04.040> be<00:01:04.160> 3000<00:01:04.940> lumens<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.050> should<00:01:06.290> be

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
to be 3000 lumens so that should be

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.520 
to be 3000 lumens so that should be
twice<00:01:07.490> as<00:01:07.700> bright<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.300> factory<00:01:08.900> h1<00:01:09.290> bulb

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530

gets a little darker I've got the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.479 
gets a little darker I've got the
driver's<00:02:24.200> side<00:02:24.350> already<00:02:24.680> installed<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.370> then

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
driver's side already installed and then

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.910 
driver's side already installed and then
I<00:02:25.580> left<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> factory<00:02:26.300> h1<00:02:26.690> bulb<00:02:26.959> in<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920

passenger side so I'll try to get you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.039 
passenger side so I'll try to get you
guys<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> lighting<00:02:30.650> output<00:02:31.610> video<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.330> then

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049

I think the 180 dollars for the kid is
any<00:02:37.970> brighter<00:02:38.299> than<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> factory<00:02:38.959> bulbs<00:02:39.290> so

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
any brighter than the factory bulbs so

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.180 
any brighter than the factory bulbs so
uh<00:02:40.480> I'll<00:02:41.480> wait<00:02:41.630> uh<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.930> stuff<00:02:42.080> all<00:02:42.830> right<00:02:42.980> guys

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.240 
it fades a little bit but it's fairly
intense<00:05:03.590> here<00:05:04.590> they<00:05:04.710> are<00:05:04.830> again<00:05:04.919> one<00:05:05.160> more

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
intense here they are again one more

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.930 
intense here they are again one more
time<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.860> see<00:05:08.039> how<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.160> halogen<00:05:08.580> bulbs<00:05:08.789> got

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
time you see how the halogen bulbs got

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.080 
time you see how the halogen bulbs got
the<00:05:09.060> one<00:05:09.570> hot<00:05:09.810> spot<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.289> center<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.430> it's

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
the one hot spot in the center and it's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.930 
the one hot spot in the center and it's
lower<00:05:13.910> but<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.060> LED<00:05:15.450> itself<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:17.460> appears<00:05:17.820> to

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
lower but the LED itself it appears to

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.790 
lower but the LED itself it appears to
be<00:05:18.060> brighter<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.930> halogen<00:05:19.320> bulb<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:19.650> that's

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
be brighter the halogen bulb but that's

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.950 
be brighter the halogen bulb but that's
just<00:05:19.889> due<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.099> the<00:05:20.250> camera<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:21.419> focuses<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:21.900> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
just due to the camera it focuses on the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.510 
just due to the camera it focuses on the
brighter<00:05:22.260> part<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.830> then<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.099> seems<00:05:23.310> like<00:05:23.370> it

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
brighter part and then it seems like it

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.070 
brighter part and then it seems like it
fades<00:05:23.760> really<00:05:24.060> fast<00:05:24.330> but<00:05:24.630> if<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:24.900> actually

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
fades really fast but if you actually

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.580 
fades really fast but if you actually
step<00:05:26.070> out<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> way<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.520> can<00:05:26.789> see<00:05:27.060> that

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
step out of the way you can see that

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
step out of the way you can see that
although<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.889> might<00:05:29.039> have<00:05:29.220> a<00:05:29.250> brighter

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
although it might have a brighter

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.850 
although it might have a brighter
hotspot<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.450> center<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.960> distribution

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
hotspot in the center the distribution

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.260 
hotspot in the center the distribution
of<00:05:31.919> light<00:05:32.479> is<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.570> lot<00:05:33.870> greater<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.970> all<00:05:35.970> clear

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
of light is a lot greater and all clear

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.719 
of light is a lot greater and all clear
-<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.690> looks<00:05:36.870> almost<00:05:37.020> all<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.250> colors<00:05:38.580> look

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
- it looks almost all the colors look

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.600 
- it looks almost all the colors look
more<00:05:38.940> natural<00:05:39.389> from<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.990> LED<00:05:40.289> itself<00:05:40.979> than

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
more natural from the LED itself than

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.040 
more natural from the LED itself than
the<00:05:42.599> yellowish<00:05:43.020> tint<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.469> the<00:05:43.650> housing<00:05:44.070> ball

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
the yellowish tint of the housing ball

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.210 
the yellowish tint of the housing ball
so<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.110> hope<00:05:46.229> this

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220

like<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.090> said<00:06:09.330> earlier<00:06:09.660> about<00:06:09.740> I'd<00:06:10.740> say<00:06:10.770> about

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
like I said earlier about I'd say about

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.030 
like I said earlier about I'd say about
32%<00:06:11.790> brighter<00:06:12.330> than<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.810> factory<00:06:13.410> h1<00:06:13.800> bulbs

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
32% brighter than the factory h1 bulbs

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.710 
32% brighter than the factory h1 bulbs
it<00:06:14.310> replaced<00:06:14.670> and<00:06:17.270> overall<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.300> think<00:06:18.630> it's

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
it replaced and overall I think it's

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
it replaced and overall I think it's
pretty<00:06:19.350> good<00:06:19.560> upgrade<00:06:20.750> so<00:06:21.750> might<00:06:22.410> check<00:06:22.620> them

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
pretty good upgrade so might check them

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.490 
pretty good upgrade so might check them
out<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:23.160> LEDs<00:06:23.640> calm<00:06:26.690> just<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:27.810> short<00:06:28.080> video<00:06:28.260> to

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.050 
out the LEDs calm just a short video to
show<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:28.860> guys<00:06:29.130> they<00:06:29.400> are<00:06:29.550> there<00:06:29.910> are<00:06:30.030> a

am<00:06:37.050> gonna<00:06:37.230> raise<00:06:37.470> them<00:06:37.620> up<00:06:37.770> probably<00:06:38.160> about

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
am gonna raise them up probably about

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.170 
am gonna raise them up probably about
six<00:06:39.390> inches<00:06:40.040> adjust<00:06:41.040> them<00:06:41.250> on<00:06:41.400> my<00:06:41.610> in<00:06:42.150> my

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
driveway uphill so I named him a little

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.470 
driveway uphill so I named him a little
lower<00:06:45.990> than<00:06:46.170> what<00:06:46.440> I<00:06:46.470> thought<00:06:46.680> I<00:06:46.740> was<00:06:47.270> so<00:06:48.270> I'm

here's<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.530> factory<00:07:05.530> high-beams<00:07:06.390> and<00:07:07.390> throw

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
here's the factory high-beams and throw

here's the factory high-beams and throw
a<00:07:07.630> lot<00:07:07.810> of<00:07:07.840> light<00:07:08.080> right<00:07:08.350> in<00:07:08.380> the<00:07:08.500> middle<00:07:08.760> but

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
a lot of light right in the middle but

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.190 
a lot of light right in the middle but
as<00:07:09.940> I<00:07:10.090> said<00:07:10.150> earlier<00:07:10.330> they're<00:07:10.750> aimed<00:07:10.930> higher

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 
as I said earlier they're aimed higher

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.030 
as I said earlier they're aimed higher
also<00:07:11.710> their<00:07:12.040> high<00:07:12.190> beams<00:07:13.380> you<00:07:14.380> can<00:07:14.410> see<00:07:14.680> a<00:07:14.710> lot

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
also their high beams you can see a lot

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.890 
also their high beams you can see a lot
of<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.250> light<00:07:15.460> right<00:07:16.150> down<00:07:16.390> in<00:07:16.540> front<00:07:16.780> of<00:07:16.840> the
