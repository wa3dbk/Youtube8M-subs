00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
new way on how to get out of any part of

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.049 
new way on how to get out of any part of
any<00:00:07.020> map<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.470> advanced<00:00:07.950> warfare<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.970> is

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
any map on advanced warfare now this is

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.299 
any map on advanced warfare now this is
extremely<00:00:09.540> easy<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.840> do<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.650> lot

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
extremely easy to do and it is a lot

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.160 
extremely easy to do and it is a lot
like<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.940> dragon<00:00:12.450> fire<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> map

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
like the dragon fire out of the map

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.839 
like the dragon fire out of the map
glitch<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.590> black<00:00:13.769> ops<00:00:13.980> 2<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.519> guys<00:00:14.670> know

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
glitch on black ops 2 if you guys know

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.000 
glitch on black ops 2 if you guys know
what<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.330> um<00:00:15.540> if<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.289> don't<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.800> kind

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
what that is um if you don't it was kind

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.830 
what that is um if you don't it was kind
of<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.160> hard<00:00:17.369> way<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.390> map<00:00:18.570> but

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
of a hard way to get out of the map but

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
of a hard way to get out of the map but
you<00:00:18.869> were<00:00:19.050> able<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> travel<00:00:20.010> around<00:00:20.250> anywhere

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you were able to travel around anywhere

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.660 
you were able to travel around anywhere
on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> map<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.160> essentially

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
on the map and so this is essentially

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
on the map and so this is essentially
what<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.480> except<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.260> 10

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
what it is it's like except it's like 10

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
what it is it's like except it's like 10
times<00:00:25.769> easier<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:27.210> does<00:00:27.480> only

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
times easier to do so this does only

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
times easier to do so this does only
work<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.109> private<00:00:28.380> match<00:00:28.619> unfortunately<00:00:29.279> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
work in private match unfortunately but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.919 
work in private match unfortunately but
this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.420> cool<00:00:30.720> glitch

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this is a really really cool glitch

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.770 
this is a really really cool glitch
because<00:00:31.320> um<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.700> score<00:00:33.270> explore

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
because um you can score explore

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
because um you can score explore
anywhere<00:00:34.320> outside<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> map<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> can

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
anywhere outside of the map and you can

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
anywhere outside of the map and you can
get<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.760> extremely<00:00:36.600> high<00:00:36.719> trickshot

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
get to these extremely high trickshot

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
get to these extremely high trickshot
spots<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.460> only<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
spots that you can really only do in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
spots that you can really only do in
like<00:00:39.030> Superman<00:00:39.570> lobbies<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
like Superman lobbies or something like

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
like Superman lobbies or something like
that<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.129> insane<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> another

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that so it's really insane and another

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
that so it's really insane and another
cool<00:00:42.750> thing<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> once<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
cool thing is that once you do the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.889 
cool thing is that once you do the
glitch<00:00:44.370> once<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.030> able<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> spawn<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
glitch once you'll be able to spawn in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
glitch once you'll be able to spawn in
that<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.379> spot<00:00:46.770> outside<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> map<00:00:47.670> every

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that same spot outside of the map every

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
that same spot outside of the map every
time<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.110> almost<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.440> having<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
time so it's almost like having a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
time so it's almost like having a
tactical<00:00:50.280> insertion<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.780> said<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
tactical insertion so like I said it is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
tactical insertion so like I said it is
very<00:00:52.620> simple<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.280> um<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
very simple to do um you can do it in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
very simple to do um you can do it in
any<00:00:54.930> game<00:00:55.260> mode<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> change

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
any game mode you just have to change

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.069 
any game mode you just have to change
the<00:00:56.760> spawn<00:00:57.030> settings<00:00:57.390> around<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the spawn settings around here that I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
the spawn settings around here that I
will<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> screen<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.280> there<00:00:59.670> will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
will put on the screen and there will

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
will put on the screen and there will
also<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.000> settings<00:01:00.539> written<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
also be settings written out for you in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.939 
also be settings written out for you in
the<00:01:02.100> description<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.110> extremely<00:01:04.589> easy

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the description and it is extremely easy

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
the description and it is extremely easy
to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> said<00:01:05.880> um<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> even

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to do like I said um but it is even

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
to do like I said um but it is even
easier<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.570> host<00:01:09.900> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
easier to do when you are not host so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
easier to do when you are not host so
definitely<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> better<00:01:12.240> idea<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
definitely it would be a better idea to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
definitely it would be a better idea to
have<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> friend<00:01:13.380> hosted<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
have a friend hosted for you or if you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
have a friend hosted for you or if you
have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> dummy<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> should<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> him

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have a dummy then you should have him

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
have a dummy then you should have him
host<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.270> start

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
host it so how you do this is you start

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
host it so how you do this is you start
out<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> team<00:01:19.140> Atlas<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.860> once<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> game

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
out on the team Atlas and once the game

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
out on the team Atlas and once the game
starts<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> change<00:01:21.600> teams<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
starts you want to change teams and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
starts you want to change teams and
press<00:01:22.409> spectator<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.670> after<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.180> go

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
press spectator and then after that go

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
press spectator and then after that go
back<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.960> team<00:01:25.229> Atlas<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.610> choose<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
back to team Atlas but do not choose a

like walk around and explore and all
that<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.530> said<00:02:04.770> when<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> die<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.759> spawn

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that like I said when you die you spawn

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.280 
that like I said when you die you spawn
right<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> same<00:02:06.930> place<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
right back in the same place you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
right back in the same place you
originally<00:02:07.770> did<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> map<00:02:08.550> which

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
originally did out of the map which

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
originally did out of the map which
means<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.569> said<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.869> basically<00:02:10.140> like

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
means like I said it's basically like

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.790 
means like I said it's basically like
having<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.770> tactical<00:02:11.280> insertion

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800

bit easier for you guys to follow when
you<00:02:31.420> guys<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.900> setting<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.380> game

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
you guys are like setting up the game

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.260 
you guys are like setting up the game
and<00:02:32.770> everything<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.430> also<00:02:33.580> guys<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:33.910> you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
and everything and so also guys if you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.330 
and everything and so also guys if you
find<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> spawn<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.680> place<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
find that you spawn in a place and you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
find that you spawn in a place and you
get<00:02:36.580> stuff<00:02:36.910> or<00:02:37.150> can't<00:02:37.390> move<00:02:37.570> all<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.320> have<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
get stuff or can't move all you have to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.160 
get stuff or can't move all you have to
do<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:39.010> go<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.940> spot<00:02:40.240> again<00:02:40.390> except<00:02:40.990> go

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
do is go to that spot again except go

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.010 
do is go to that spot again except go
higher<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.860> above<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.850> spot<00:02:43.060> because<00:02:43.480> when

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
higher up above the spot because when

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.510 
higher up above the spot because when
you<00:02:44.110> get<00:02:44.290> stuck<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.710> essentially<00:02:45.190> means<00:02:45.430> you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
you get stuck that essentially means you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.760 
you get stuck that essentially means you
spawned<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.360> barrier<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:46.990> next<00:02:47.440> time<00:02:47.620> you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
spawned in a barrier so next time you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.110 
spawned in a barrier so next time you
just<00:02:47.920> got<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.160> make<00:02:48.250> sure<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.490> spawn<00:02:48.730> above

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
just got to make sure you spawn above

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.970 
just got to make sure you spawn above
the<00:02:49.270> barriers<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.710> know<00:02:50.800> if

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the barriers then you can you know if

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440 
the barriers then you can you know if
you<00:02:51.100> want<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.430> fall<00:02:51.640> down<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.090> bit<00:02:52.300> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you want to fall down a little bit and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.060 
you want to fall down a little bit and
you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.630> then<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.350> like<00:02:53.500> walk<00:02:53.740> around

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
you can then you can like walk around
