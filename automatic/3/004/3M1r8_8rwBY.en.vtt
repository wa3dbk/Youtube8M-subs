00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 faye everyone sees that today 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.700
 this Sunday morning is so there what 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 changes the perception of the market 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.849
 I will put the sport are expected 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.460
 which 180 so thing that I would do 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.310
 export finally I finished 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.199
 orange time a bill to contact him 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.220
 because I do now it's up to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.050
 walk and the money 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 I only had a little more of that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.730
 more prices some vegetables to the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730
 House 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.850
 so here I have a memory at the market 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.120
 thrives on what I presented the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.920
 banana the watermelon and then I took 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 of interest by then I'm coming home 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.310
 to prepare my membership 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.370
 two cars of watermelons the banana of the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.650
 salad and then some strawberries to post that 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.060
 I can eat in quarters a day or even 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.290
 watermelon cars a day I like 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.340
 a lot a lot of plastic and then 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.170
 which is good as I said what 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 it's really water so I drink 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 also others every day of course and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.690
 then I also eat a lot of pastels 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.260
 because as I said that the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.300
 watermelon 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.410
 so after that it's time to taste it 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.020
 because I'm going to take but everything to 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.110
 the time I'm going to say we'll say 18h or 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 19h I'll go out to go to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.369
 sport one finally for lunches 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.180
 I chose to eat more 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.740
 shrimp I think I'm going to eat this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.119
 evening actually shrimp at the meal of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.950
 tonight so actually this is what I'm eating 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 it's just really it can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.039
 look a lot actually but actually 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 it is to give in so we do cd 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.490
 are actually the skull recipe I know 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.990
 not if I maybe when I had 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.479
 Online videos I answer yet set 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.350
 the recipe I finished my business in 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.310
 does how do I have for 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.020
 prepare but serious 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 so this is actually it's crabs that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.209
 I preferred to Thai sauce and there I 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.979
 a portion of rip separate games are 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.190
 standing so it's a half-share are 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.370
 gathered by sion would therefore have two meanings 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.470
 was 195 g in rice leaves it is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.360
 fears for actually it's 15 hours 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.910
 that's what I think and biscuits 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.060
 to have to go find out that's 150 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.530
 calories and easily towards actually 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.510
 soya milk in Chad 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.519
 so she looks like that and actually 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.870
 this is very very good it is very 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.090
 very good I like a lot of milk from 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.600
 soy and especially this one there is so much 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.680
 does favors inside so 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.930
 I actually like the first one in 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.640
 mostly does the opposite way actually 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 a day because it's pretty protein 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.060
 still so if by order to drink 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.549
 actually much more drinks per day 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.280
 in 240 milliliters so that's what 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.049
 I have here and that's that's for 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 taste and after that sense that I record 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.350
 salad and shrimp the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.520
 maintenance and the evening is a fact 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.290
 finally from me what I did and I 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.580
 prepared my dinner so as they say 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.050
 when I hear a little mans jeans done 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.670
 from finland to chinese with 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.210
 shrimp and I brought back the future 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.730
 rock 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.540
 so that's not a lot of calories and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.730
 then light enough and then there actually 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.070
 is 7.30 pm which after I finish 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.720
 eat I'll go do the sport go to 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.430
 20:30 20:45 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.080
 and then after I come back and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.820
 then I'm going to sleep but for example if 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.710
 I never have a small hollow before going 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.980
 to sleep but I do not think I take the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.790
 watermelon so no stx and water 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.160
 graphically it's good too 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.500
 so that's what I eat but 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.530
 shrimp with salad do you actually 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.050
 tear off images for that tonight and for 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.690
 the elementary 45g go out by sports 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.510
 and you remember it was saturday 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.870
 when I had when I had walked in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.110
 made 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 in fact I had market coding and then as 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.320
 the age and my thighs that makes me super 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.000
 wrong that is actually it's the 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.290
 pain because it means that it 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120
 walk so the thing is that you 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.950
 did not stop making history to 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.630
 cause of pain forgets continue to 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 to exercise to your body can 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.230
 adapt is more accustomed to actually 12 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.760
 hours like that as you 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.900
 go do the sport as you go 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.120
 that they were going to actually increase 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.600
 intensity for your body will adapt 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.140
 as well 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.540
 so here I am tired I have not 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.609
 want to go to ko but hey it takes 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.310
 to know whether to go back to the work 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.300
 by hitting the first part of an effect 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.659
 to lighten market 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.080
 for miles and now I'm going 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.750
 go to the port of kilometers and there 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.860
 now make up the slope but 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.360
 if you feel like you want 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.530
 to stop 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.220
 must make because it's that 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.379
 really bad it means that if tomorrow 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.539
 we 're really going to be one of the greens 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.550
 work on ministers finally always 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.680
 always that you say you just want that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.349
 when that happens at home you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.460
 to be able to rest well of love 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.620
 but what will be closed what is found 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.430
 really really give 100% 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.810
 yes just to say 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.530
 info 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.240
 score you do not need to believe 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.120
 it's because we are little by little 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.560
 is no need to put to you the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.900
 boundaries that are really strong after that 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.849
 because it does not work go go small to 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.539
 small and more 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.759
 in fact as and when to undo 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.610
 hope you will adapt yourself 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.589
 will see you will succeed in making 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.719
 more and more things we're going to buses is

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.039
 today I can say that I have 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.389
 really did start taking a little 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.039
 of rhythm I could do a 4 km in 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.119
 current is no longer a merchant does not 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.319
 market for the race actually to undermine 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:01.240
 I hope to be able to do all four 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.039
 kilometers running a c4 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.879
 we never know maybe display 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.050
 would act so that's all that makes a 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.469
 hour ago when I get home 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.009
