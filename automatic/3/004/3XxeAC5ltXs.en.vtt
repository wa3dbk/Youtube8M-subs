you don't remember specific phases but I
do<00:01:00.589> remember<00:01:00.830> I<00:01:01.010> think<00:01:01.190> Ronnie's<00:01:01.460> made<00:01:01.670> two

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
do remember I think Ronnie's made two

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.930 
do remember I think Ronnie's made two
centuries<00:01:02.839> in<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.989> ninety<00:01:03.350> or<00:01:03.440> something

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
centuries in the ninety or something

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.490 
centuries in the ninety or something
sure<00:01:05.420> I've<00:01:05.540> given<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.930> mistakes<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:06.470> I

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
sure I've given in the mistakes and I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
sure I've given in the mistakes and I
played<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.710> sort<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.040> game<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.310> Ronnie

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
played the sort of game that Ronnie

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.920 
played the sort of game that Ronnie
lights<00:01:07.790> I'm<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.030> similar<00:01:08.330> type<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.540> player<00:01:08.810> to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.300 
lights I'm a similar type of player to
him<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.140> terms<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.500> how<00:01:09.650> much<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:09.950> attack<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
him in terms of how much I attack the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.410 
him in terms of how much I attack the
balls<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.710> yeah<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.740> mean<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.219> Baus<00:01:13.399> he<00:01:14.149> seems

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
very relaxed and count to me I mean that

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.279 
very relaxed and count to me I mean that
is<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.729> completely<00:01:17.180> different<00:01:17.329> Ronnie<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:18.140> what

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
is a completely different Ronnie to what

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.889 
is a completely different Ronnie to what
we've<00:01:18.439> seen<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.710> season<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.899> don't

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
we've seen this season and I don't

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.810 
we've seen this season and I don't
really<00:01:21.229> think<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:21.619> was<00:01:21.740> wrong<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.340> what<00:01:22.609> I<00:01:22.640> was

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
really think I was wrong in what I was

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.399 
really think I was wrong in what I was
saying<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> bill<00:01:23.420> that's<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.750> match<00:01:24.020> in

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
saying in the bill that's this match in

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.840 
saying in the bill that's this match in
that<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.859> know<00:01:24.979> if<00:01:25.070> Ronnie<00:01:25.280> played<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.729> way

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
that you know if Ronnie played the way

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.370 
that you know if Ronnie played the way
did<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.240> season<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:26.719> thought<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.020> could<00:01:27.229> beat

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
did this season I thought I could beat

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.190 
did this season I thought I could beat
him<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.700> know<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.090> think<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.689> ball<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.049> out

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
him and you know I think a ball that out

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.840 
him and you know I think a ball that out
because<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.560> lost<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:31.009> all<00:01:31.189> with<00:01:31.310> him<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.579> I<00:01:31.640> had

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
because I lost to all with him and I had

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.550 
because I lost to all with him and I had

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the chances for three two and four to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.830 
the chances for three two and four to
the<00:01:33.920> balls<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.310> my<00:01:34.429> court<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.909> had<00:01:35.149> significant

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
a heavy score myself when I'm playing

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 
a heavy score myself when I'm playing
well<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.810> know<00:02:14.900> II<00:02:14.930> haven't<00:02:15.200> been<00:02:15.350> here

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
well but you know II haven't been here

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.229 
well but you know II haven't been here
for<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.710> few<00:02:15.860> years<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.220> kind<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.760> mind<00:02:17.090> in

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
for a few years you kind of mind in

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.000 
for a few years you kind of mind in
Newark<00:02:17.510> too<00:02:17.750> much<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.110> not<00:02:18.230> let<00:02:18.379> himself<00:02:18.530> flow

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
Newark too much and not let himself flow

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.510 
Newark too much and not let himself flow
and<00:02:19.480> probably<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:20.599> careful<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and probably over careful and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and probably over careful and
yeah<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.550> mean<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.850> tough<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.210> there<00:02:24.240> any

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
yeah I mean it's tough out there any

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420 
yeah I mean it's tough out there any
plain<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.900> yet<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.500> know<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.100> tough<00:02:26.310> draw

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
plain one yet you know it's a tough draw

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.680 
plain one yet you know it's a tough draw
anyway<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.820> thought<00:02:27.090> he<00:02:27.210> was<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.480> bit

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
anyway I thought he was a little bit

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.910 
anyway I thought he was a little bit
runnable<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.230> well<00:02:28.350> he<00:02:28.410> was<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.770> course

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
runnable and it well he was of course

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.250 
runnable and it well he was of course
coming<00:02:29.310> into<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:29.940> he<00:02:30.660> sort<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.990> proved

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
coming into this but he sort of proved

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
coming into this but he sort of proved
everybody<00:02:31.500> wrong<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.040> he's<00:02:32.130> he's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
everybody wrong that he's he's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270
