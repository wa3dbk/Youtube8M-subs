a<00:02:03.970> week<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.480> few<00:02:05.780> days<00:02:05.990> now

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
a week in a few days now

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.550 
a week in a few days now
at<00:02:06.890> first<00:02:07.220> when<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.330> owner<00:02:08.660> contacted<00:02:09.289> me<00:02:09.350> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
at first when the owner contacted me and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.680 
at first when the owner contacted me and
told<00:02:09.619> me<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.039> she<00:02:10.369> wanted<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.789> review<00:02:11.420> her

kinky<00:02:12.260> curly<00:02:12.500> hair<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.340> was<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.850> little<00:02:14.210> hesitant

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
kinky curly hair I was a little hesitant

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.010 
kinky curly hair I was a little hesitant
because<00:02:15.140> I've<00:02:15.980> had<00:02:16.220> kinky<00:02:16.730> curly<00:02:16.910> hair<00:02:17.240> once

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
because I've had kinky curly hair once

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.560 
because I've had kinky curly hair once
before<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:18.620> experience<00:02:19.280> wasn't<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:20.090> great

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
before my experience wasn't that great

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.140 
before my experience wasn't that great
so<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.200> kind<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.680> turned<00:02:22.310> me<00:02:22.459> off<00:02:22.640> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
so it kind of just turned me off to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.880 
so it kind of just turned me off to
kinky<00:02:23.480> curly<00:02:23.630> hair<00:02:23.990> altogether

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
kinky curly hair altogether

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890 
kinky curly hair altogether
