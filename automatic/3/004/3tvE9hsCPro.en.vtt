00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there's just the basic shapes in that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
there's just the basic shapes in that
you<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.170> long<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.649> how<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you know as long as you know how to you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
you know as long as you know how to you
know<00:00:41.129> put<00:00:41.940> together<00:00:42.059> these<00:00:42.450> basic<00:00:42.870> shapes

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
know put together these basic shapes

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
know put together these basic shapes
you'll<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.010> able<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.340> draw<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.989> foundation<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you'll be able to draw the foundation of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.510 
you'll be able to draw the foundation of
many<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> characters<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.340> your

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
many of the characters so your

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.569 
many of the characters so your
skateboard<00:00:48.090> game<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.500> shows<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
skateboard game or shows and you just

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
skateboard game or shows and you just
draw<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.789> simple<00:00:51.120> shapes<00:00:51.590> tracing<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> next

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
draw the simple shapes tracing the next

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.970 
draw the simple shapes tracing the next
step<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:54.210> voila<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.320> fill<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.770> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
step and well voila you fill it in and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.689 
step and well voila you fill it in and
that's<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.649> shows<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that's pretty much it so it shows off a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
that's pretty much it so it shows off a
lot<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.480> characters<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.430> Ocarina<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
lot of the characters from Ocarina of

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.250 
lot of the characters from Ocarina of
Time<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:04.010> Majora's<00:01:05.010> Mask

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
Time and Majora's Mask

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.340 
Time and Majora's Mask
in<00:01:07.260> fact<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> fact<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.689> characters<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
in fact the fact it's all characters and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
in fact the fact it's all characters and
enemies<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> bosses<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.549> ocarina<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> time

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
enemies and bosses from ocarina of time

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
enemies and bosses from ocarina of time
and<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.570> only<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.770> Majora's<00:01:14.369> Mask

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and there's only one from Majora's Mask

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.990 
and there's only one from Majora's Mask
so<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:16.740> cool<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.369> pretty<00:01:17.759> basic

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so it's pretty cool it's pretty basic

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.969 
so it's pretty cool it's pretty basic
though<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.560> basic

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
though as you can see it's just basic

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.530 
though as you can see it's just basic
shapes<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> trace<00:01:21.330> over<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:22.250> and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
shapes and then you trace over them and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
shapes and then you trace over them and
I<00:01:24.540> guess<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.200> helpful<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> are

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I guess it could be helpful if you are

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.810 
I guess it could be helpful if you are
just<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:27.420> starting<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.320> an<00:01:28.590> artist<00:01:29.549> or

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just just starting to be an artist or

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
just just starting to be an artist or
just<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> learn<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
just you want to learn how to do some of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.120 
just you want to learn how to do some of
the<00:01:32.040> most<00:01:32.189> basic<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.990> drawings<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:35.009> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the most basic of drawings I think it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.319 
the most basic of drawings I think it's
it's<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.720> pretty<00:01:36.720> neat<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.229> pretty<00:01:37.470> cool<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
it's a pretty neat it's pretty cool I

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's a pretty neat it's pretty cool I
remember<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.689> back<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> daylight<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
remember back on back in the daylight I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.819 
remember back on back in the daylight I
actually<00:01:41.430> tried<00:01:41.880> drawing<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.509> times<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.110> what

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
actually tried drawing at times and what

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.139 
actually tried drawing at times and what
I<00:01:43.860> would<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.640> had<00:01:44.790> some<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I would do is just I had some of the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.490 
I would do is just I had some of the
official<00:01:45.509> guides<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
official guides and I would just put a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.429 
official guides and I would just put a
piece<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.860> paper<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.340> over<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> guide<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
piece of paper right over the guide and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.940 
piece of paper right over the guide and
literally<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.680> trace<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.610> over<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> but

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
literally just trace right over it but

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
literally just trace right over it but
so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> despite<00:01:53.520> being<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.240> from

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so I despite being from just from

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
so I despite being from just from
Ocarina<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> Time<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> Majora's<00:01:56.159> Mask<00:01:56.430> all

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask all

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.690 
Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask all
the<00:01:57.509> characters<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.860> said<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.250> from

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the characters as I said are from
