00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.420
 alba very happy all this to be more than a year seems like a dream another 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.800
 he was one of the greats and he delivered it at the crossroad 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.650
 this fool what his name means as artist as architect as 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.380
 sculptor like PAN would have here a sample of 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.879
 but what is the totality of his work his work in different disciplines 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.770
 this one year part of a fantastic collection 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.740
 this tea was very recently was nothing more nor less than in the museum queen 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.080
 Sofia of Madrid 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.560
 and can have it good to hear here in Punta del Este 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.969
 is this na 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.320
 huge satisfaction 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.600
 apart with the extensive that the sample has not previously previously ho ho 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.310
 March 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.770
 yes that's a big effort to try to get the sample to March 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.350
 so they can in high schools 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.160
 this knowing winder a unique opportunity and this the fis and 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.000
 bring these kinds of samples to advocate and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580
 this 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.310
 so it meant no 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 this for collectors to get rid of their collection having to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.650
 to cross the Atlantic to come here to a place this enclave is unknown 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.790
 in him in the world of cinema 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 European and and good if a great effort the nations warren a great generosity 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 from private collectors 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 this one was already lesson jungles late until I insinuated him more is what 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.570
 meaning for young architects is this sample and this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.159
 phenomenon 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 for this is fantastic this collection comes neither more nor less than the ife and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.420
 governance 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.900
 this conor have seen the model there and the photos is the last of the physio 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.390
 designed by 2 7 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.470
 and it is this for all the students forced to live nailing perform their 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.490
 trip is a building studied by butarque reading this the ecobus and in 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.939
 vain this 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.609
 name that is repeated throughout the race and that level the father the 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.790
 modernity is responsible for that 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.279
 today we have good 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.399
 is architecture cat I do not go out crosses in Uruguay 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.779
 this somehow the 'I fight' a lot for 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:24.709
 percent and achieve that ambition modama that this capture the past but 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.129
 capture your spirit not to repeat it but to reinterpret it 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.139
 this 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.219
 and well nothing of what 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.799
 eva and many famous people of tura state 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.879
 after a journey in which first-year students 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.150
 here to make a taser makes that contact of the gunners with the facet 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.669
 this 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.909
 most intimate of 2007 and sometimes it's not 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 I knew this but that experience 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.849
 a medal that he deserves personal for having been in europe and 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.159
 now with sought the uruburu blue red bj 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.630
 good yes when it came and began to materialize all this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.899
 efe 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.839
 in one interesting thing he was 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:09.249
 the contact that had here tic existed between borussia and uruguay 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.699
 hundred 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.409
 a key fact was the business visit in 1929 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.359
 this pole 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.859
 p 6 an investigation 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.029
 It is very profound that afterwards he derived in a book that he is from lucien him in 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:27.180
 the river of the silver portion of the ecobus idea is very very generous note to its 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.910
 place and makes your people make your country to efe 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.720
 well the level of its architects 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.219
 this after another fact 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.759
 the one that was fundamental I would say for percent what there is to be and for 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.709
 of Uruguay for several generations and in the participation of 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.749
 three Uruguayans 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.209
 who worked in their studio in paris 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.789
 this and good with justino sarrasqueta who lives in the north of france 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:58.019
 also received and really this know to have contact with the one we 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:58.779
 transmit 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.550
 this the intensity of what he was 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.410
 this awesome creator who did not lose a minute of his life that treme 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.549
 Añón has painted the studio late 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.519
 this how good that quique is sculptures that are treated and specified 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.049
 who designed furniture building cities 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.289
 this 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:19.359
 good to have that contact with him the direct transmission of both him and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.490
 this also in this case leave ibor this really is this is amazing with 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.210
 incredible anecdotes like a barbecue this what is 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.339
 What did they eat organized by the Uruguayans of Maidana de Euros Siena 

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.500
 incredible photos 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.710
 but he was complicated are 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.250
 really this anecdotes is between them a little forgotten and that now 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.449
 they were rescued justly met this position 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.580
 they were already notoriously the mtc for all the public not to date 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.360
 you do not have the death if you are of course all invited the entrance 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.960
 free sample is enough 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.830
 this until March 25 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.650
 the schedule from 10 in the morning to 10 at night 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.030
 this will do we look at everyone to come and enjoy highlighted
