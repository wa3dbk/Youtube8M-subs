00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
looking either when I look at a manga

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
looking either when I look at a manga
character<00:01:09.799> specifically<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> main

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

characters that are telling the story
what<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> reflection<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:16.049> what

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
what I see is like a reflection of what

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.609 
what I see is like a reflection of what
is<00:01:16.470> inside<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> me<00:01:17.430> inside<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.119> us<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.470> they

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is inside of me inside of us as if they

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.950 
is inside of me inside of us as if they
portray<00:01:20.070> America<00:01:20.729> flexion<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.600> our<00:01:21.720> inner

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
portray America flexion of our inner

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.850 
portray America flexion of our inner
human<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> next<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.189> death<00:01:23.430> manga<00:01:24.240> characters

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
human and next to death manga characters

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
human and next to death manga characters
to<00:01:25.860> me<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.939> comparable<00:01:27.420> with

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to me are not really comparable with

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
to me are not really comparable with
actual<00:01:28.140> humans<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> character

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
actual humans I see them as a character

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870 
actual humans I see them as a character
or<00:01:30.420> creation<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:31.979> human<00:01:32.430> aspects

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
or creation but with very human aspects

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
or creation but with very human aspects
to<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.079> relate<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
to them so we can relate to them like a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.060 
to them so we can relate to them like a
Mickey<00:01:36.150> Mouse<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> tonica's<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> Ninja

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
Mickey Mouse or a tonica's and Ninja

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.160 
Mickey Mouse or a tonica's and Ninja
Turtles<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.390> animal<00:01:39.840> based

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
Turtles these are animal based

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
Turtles these are animal based
characters<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.979> still<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> human<00:01:41.759> nature

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
characters but still have a human nature

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.690 
characters but still have a human nature
oh<00:01:42.509> that's<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> same<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> look<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.430> manga

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
oh that's the same way I look at manga

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
oh that's the same way I look at manga
characters<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.200> matter<00:01:46.560> which

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
characters so it doesn't matter which

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819 
characters so it doesn't matter which
race<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.729> character<00:01:48.299> has<00:01:48.630> unless<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
race the character has unless it's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
race the character has unless it's
functional<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> storytelling<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
functional for the storytelling if the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
functional for the storytelling if the
race<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> an<00:01:52.350> essential<00:01:52.890> part<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> toeing

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
race is an essential part of the toeing
