differently just to help these members
and<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:45.170> know<00:00:45.290> basically<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.040> on<00:00:46.580> the<00:00:47.270> phone

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
and you know basically it's on the phone

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:57.100 
and you know basically it's on the phone
and<00:00:48.100> taking<00:00:49.100> calls<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.580> making<00:00:50.030> calls

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.020 

the<00:00:57.860> main<00:00:58.010> tools<00:00:58.190> will<00:00:58.370> go<00:00:58.489> telephone<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the main tools will go telephone the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.459 
the main tools will go telephone the
computer<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.600> computer<00:00:59.989> we<00:01:00.079> have<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.200> lot

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
computer on the computer we have a lot

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.799 
computer on the computer we have a lot
of<00:01:00.500> resources<00:01:01.190> on<00:01:01.340> their<00:01:01.610> assessment<00:01:02.600> tools

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
of resources on their assessment tools

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.060 
of resources on their assessment tools
that<00:01:03.050> we<00:01:03.379> can<00:01:03.590> look<00:01:03.770> at<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.220> lot<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.760> them<00:01:05.030> are

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
that we can look at a lot of them are

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.620 
that we can look at a lot of them are
specific<00:01:07.070> information<00:01:07.340> on<00:01:07.940> and<00:01:08.420> what's

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
specific information on and what's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.300 
specific information on and what's
appropriate<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.380> what<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.710> ask<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.100> consumer

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.850 

the<00:01:17.090> biggest<00:01:17.570> difference<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.140> probably<00:01:18.590> just

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the biggest difference is probably just

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.670 
the biggest difference is probably just
the<00:01:19.310> visual<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.960> have<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.500> have

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the visual and you have to so you have

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.250 
the visual and you have to so you have
to<00:01:21.860> pick<00:01:22.550> out<00:01:22.760> what<00:01:22.940> they're<00:01:23.150> seeing<00:01:23.450> how

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
to pick out what they're seeing how

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.690 
to pick out what they're seeing how
they're<00:01:24.500> seeing<00:01:24.770> at<00:01:25.040> their<00:01:25.220> tone<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.460> their

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
they're seeing at their tone of their

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.030 
they're seeing at their tone of their
voice<00:01:25.729> rather<00:01:26.330> than<00:01:26.630> actually<00:01:27.080> looking<00:01:27.290> at

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
voice rather than actually looking at

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.280 
voice rather than actually looking at
them<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.490> seeing<00:01:28.729> their<00:01:28.910> their<00:01:29.510> verbal

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
them and seeing their their verbal

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.800 
them and seeing their their verbal
expressions<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:30.979> their<00:01:31.160> behavior<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.940> know

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
expressions and their behavior you know

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.800 
expressions and their behavior you know
I<00:01:32.840> think<00:01:32.990> after<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.940> get<00:01:35.119> comfortable<00:01:35.510> with

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
I think after you get comfortable with

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.020 
I think after you get comfortable with
that<00:01:35.960> what<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.380> know<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:37.400> takes<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.760> little

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
that what you know it it takes a little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.980 
that what you know it it takes a little
bit<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.490> really<00:01:41.240> are<00:01:41.510> more

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
bit but you you just really are more

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.469 
bit but you you just really are more
aware<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.320> those<00:01:42.770> cues<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.580> clues<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:44.180> listen

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
aware of those cues and clues to listen

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.710 
aware of those cues and clues to listen
for<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:46.000> trying<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.119> assess<00:01:47.270> them<00:01:47.420> over<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
for and trying to assess them over the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.310 
for and trying to assess them over the
phone

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600 

changes<00:01:55.320> changes<00:01:55.800> changes<00:01:55.830> would<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
changes changes changes would be the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.050 
changes changes changes would be the
biggest<00:01:56.790> challenge<00:01:57.320> it's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> big<00:01:58.530> company

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
biggest challenge it's a big company

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.690 
biggest challenge it's a big company
employers<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.330> purchase<00:02:00.750> our<00:02:01.020> services

employers that purchase our services

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.070 
employers that purchase our services
want<00:02:02.700> certain<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:03.630> based<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.930> what

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
want certain things and based on what

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.630 
want certain things and based on what
they<00:02:04.230> want<00:02:04.470> changes<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.700> effect<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
they want changes are in effect and so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.220 
they want changes are in effect and so
monthly<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.780> our<00:02:09.960> training

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
monthly you know we have our training

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.320 
monthly you know we have our training
that<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.650> go<00:02:10.860> through<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> updates<00:02:12.120> on

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
that we go through and that updates on

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
that we go through and that updates on
what<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.630> changes<00:02:12.990> are<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:13.380> there<00:02:13.530> are

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
what the changes are but there are

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.640 
what the changes are but there are
definitely<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.280> lot<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.330> changes<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.440> have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
definitely a lot of changes and you have

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.790 
definitely a lot of changes and you have
to<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.920> able<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> adapt<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.820> quickly

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
to be able to adapt to that quickly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.260 
to be able to adapt to that quickly
least<00:02:19.800> favorite<00:02:20.190> part<00:02:20.400> about<00:02:20.430> my<00:02:20.940> job<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
least favorite part about my job is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.680 
least favorite part about my job is
probably<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> fact<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.860> lot<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.340> members

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
probably the fact that a lot of members

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.290 
probably the fact that a lot of members
you<00:02:24.690> leave<00:02:24.900> messages<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.500> them<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you leave messages for them and so it's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.670
