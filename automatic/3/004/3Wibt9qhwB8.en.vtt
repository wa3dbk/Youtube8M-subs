00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
going to start up lightbox and I've gone

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.360 
going to start up lightbox and I've gone
into<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.210> texture<00:00:49.700> folder<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.180> chosen<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
into my texture folder and chosen a

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
into my texture folder and chosen a

we're<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:59.719> just<00:01:00.719> scale<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> down<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.890> as

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we're going to just scale it down so as

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.420 
we're going to just scale it down so as
it<00:01:02.100> fits<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.260> flat<00:01:04.260> plane<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.860> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it fits the the flat plane on there on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
it fits the the flat plane on there on
the<00:01:05.549> canvas<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.659> although<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.110> control

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the canvas you can although in control

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.750 
the canvas you can although in control
to<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:08.310> rotate<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.720> stretch<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.760> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to actually rotate and stretch it in in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.469 
to actually rotate and stretch it in in
various<00:01:12.180> aspects<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
various aspects but it's not that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.609 
various aspects but it's not that
important<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> we're<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
important for this we're just going to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.170 
important for this we're just going to
get<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> roughly<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> same<00:01:17.369> size

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.220 

now<00:01:23.750> we're<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.170> wear<00:01:24.410> Prezi<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.550> toggle

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
now we're going to wear Prezi to toggle

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.650 
now we're going to wear Prezi to toggle
into<00:01:27.230> painting<00:01:28.040> mode<00:01:28.250> I'm<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.600> to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
into painting mode I'm just going to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.050 
into painting mode I'm just going to
take<00:01:29.840> RGB<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.590> not<00:01:31.250> zyada

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
take RGB on not zyada

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.160 
take RGB on not zyada
because<00:01:32.240> we're<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.690> transfer<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
because we're just going to transfer the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.030 
because we're just going to transfer the
color<00:01:33.380> at<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.620> point<00:01:34.390> 100%<00:01:35.800> intensity<00:01:36.800> and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
color at this point 100% intensity and

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.210 
color at this point 100% intensity and
the<00:01:37.790> large<00:01:38.030> brush<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.870> just<00:01:39.770> brush<00:01:39.950> right

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
the large brush and just brush right

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.800 
the large brush and just brush right
over<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.520> canvas<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.060> basically<00:01:41.330> projects

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
over the canvas it basically projects

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.520 
over the canvas it basically projects
the<00:01:41.990> texture<00:01:42.890> onto<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.400> object<00:01:44.410> now<00:01:45.410> I'm

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the texture onto the object now I'm

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.660 
the texture onto the object now I'm
going<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.830> change<00:01:46.250> from<00:01:46.370> RGB<00:01:47.120> to<00:01:47.300> Z<00:01:47.720> ad<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.580> I'm

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
going to change from RGB to Z ad and I'm

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.840 
going to change from RGB to Z ad and I'm
lightly<00:01:50.120> brushing<00:01:50.450> over<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:51.580> mesh<00:01:52.580> at<00:01:52.760> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
lightly brushing over the mesh at the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.780 
lightly brushing over the mesh at the
moment<00:01:53.380> basically<00:01:54.380> where<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.740> white<00:01:55.430> it's

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
moment basically where it's white it's

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.000 
moment basically where it's white it's
bringing<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.390> up<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.960> where<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.350> dark<00:01:57.680> it's

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
bringing it up and where it's dark it's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.550 
bringing it up and where it's dark it's
not<00:01:59.000> bring<00:01:59.210> ly<00:01:59.360> up<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.890> we're<00:02:01.070> actually

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
not bring ly up so we're actually

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.820 
not bring ly up so we're actually
projecting<00:02:04.360> kind<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.660> bump<00:02:05.869> map<00:02:06.050> unto

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
projecting kind of like a bump map unto

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.469 
projecting kind of like a bump map unto
it<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.280> as<00:02:07.340> you'll<00:02:07.610> see<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.030> turn<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.390> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
it but as you'll see as you turn to the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.690 
it but as you'll see as you turn to the
side<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.060> will<00:02:11.480> see<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.490> we've<00:02:13.490> got

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
side now you will see that we've got

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970 
side now you will see that we've got
kind<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.000> three<00:02:14.209> dimensional<00:02:14.810> pebbles<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
kind of three dimensional pebbles with a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.110 
kind of three dimensional pebbles with a
texture<00:02:16.459> art<00:02:17.560> already<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.970> can

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
texture art already and you can

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.449 
texture art already and you can
obviously<00:02:20.450> add<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.500> few<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:21.980> your<00:02:22.100> own<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
obviously add a few of your own and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.400 
obviously add a few of your own and
enhance<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.180> bit<00:02:23.300> more<00:02:23.480> by<00:02:23.780> just

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
enhance it a little bit more by just

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.310 
enhance it a little bit more by just
manually<00:02:25.190> sculpting<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.880> few<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.240> then<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:30.200> it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
manually sculpting a few in then it's it

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.710 
manually sculpting a few in then it's it
really<00:02:30.530> these<00:02:30.650> only<00:02:30.860> kind<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.160> works<00:02:31.400> with<00:02:31.670> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
really these only kind of works with a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.780 
really these only kind of works with a
texture<00:02:32.720> where<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.709> got<00:02:33.980> kind<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.310> boom

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
texture where you it's got kind of boom

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.360 
texture where you it's got kind of boom
map<00:02:35.030> qualities<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> lighter<00:02:36.739> parts<00:02:37.190> are

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
map qualities so the lighter parts are

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220 
map qualities so the lighter parts are
raised<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.970> they're<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.690> darker<00:02:39.050> shadow

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
raised and they're the darker shadow

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.220 
raised and they're the darker shadow
areas<00:02:39.739> are<00:02:39.920> inset<00:02:40.459> kind<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.880> thing<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.870> hope

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
areas are inset kind of thing but hope

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.769 
areas are inset kind of thing but hope
you<00:02:42.350> find<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.620> useful
