00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.080
 Hello dear friends with you sinking 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.810
 and the skyrim review and rain begins 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.639
 the first mod I want to talk about 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:16.359
 it's 300 spartans 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:17.710
 and this is Leonid yes yes and the Spartans why 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.680
 300 Spartans 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.529
 but because it is very helpful 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.150
 and the fig you kill even one dragon 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.539
 slightly stronger than 1 Spartan 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.750
 Now imagine that there will be 300 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.130
 spartans from rice dragons of course this 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.700
 tin boolean 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.000
 it would be fun and so much more that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 This mod adds this rice to plantations and 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 Of course, weapons and shields clothing 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.440

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:10.890
