00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.500
 leaders think it's harder to 1 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.270
 I do not understand myself 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.270
 and then find the only solution I think we have a good rhythm online 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.249
 side was proud of you this is something that can 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.390
 in tournaments like that that's not what that's why I was 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.810
 asleep before 4 h 40 yrs 2 0 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.289
 the choice of values â€‹â€‹accor 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.569
 on the third try 5 it's a small miracle 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.129
 but it is true that after these first two sets I could have largely 

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:28.520
 losers missing 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.010
 but surely ask today I have a son people 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.090
 what do we know posting a cat for the sequel 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.290
 if the attitude very very strong member of the staff 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.280
 today it was that kind of thing she necessarily will get it right 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.010
 heart 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.710
 when I said I did not act if it could not be worse in both 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.490
 first sets is despite his g 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.350
 I managed to tour 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.620
 e the situation so 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 so much more than winning matches like that by playing very very 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.120
 wrong 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.380
 that wins too easy to lose 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 I still have a lot of pain in the assaults of the interesting 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 now I can not say it was antennists think himself the fact 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.190
 to have won the fourth set 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.100
 in the third set by giving up the fourth generation and I have a lot 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.240
 run 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 % land that make them more physically 5th 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.250
 so 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.600
 review the players of several classics 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 but for a hundred years and it was not working a year that his solutions company the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.550
 scents of the exchanges of the substance 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 see the mayor after a day to day to another 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.570
 we can do a lot better 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.010
 because it is not yet time 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.610
 physically how do you think 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 the trauma of salvation four hours of play 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.350
 nearly four hours of play in ideas or first 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 it is non-existent 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.450
 today I saw 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.340
 much more than physically I think I went to get the ball in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 head so I went to get my deepest self 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.490
 so that's it 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.740
 but no problem I train all year for that or not 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.710
 I played four years his contract
