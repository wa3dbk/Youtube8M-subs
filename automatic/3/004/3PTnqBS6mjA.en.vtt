00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.590 
than wet when I had bleached it and
everything<00:05:13.760> I<00:05:13.910> colored<00:05:14.420> it<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.420> what<00:05:20.570> I

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
everything I colored it this is what I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.950 
everything I colored it this is what I
call<00:05:20.890> natural<00:05:21.890> instincts<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.940> golden<00:05:23.450> brown

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
call natural instincts like golden brown

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.240 
call natural instincts like golden brown
I<00:05:23.990> think<00:05:25.420> yes<00:05:26.420> because<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:27.050> iron<00:05:27.320> colored

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
I think yes because the iron colored

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.250 
I think yes because the iron colored
didn't<00:05:29.180> come<00:05:29.900> out<00:05:30.050> no<00:05:31.540> no<00:05:32.540> it<00:05:32.780> didn't<00:05:33.050> come<00:05:33.230> out

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
didn't come out no no it didn't come out

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.510 
didn't come out no no it didn't come out
so<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:34.330> had<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.420> go<00:05:35.540> back<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.260> store<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:37.310> get

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
so I had to go back to the store and get

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.520 
so I had to go back to the store and get
this<00:05:37.790> and<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.900> works<00:05:39.520> so
