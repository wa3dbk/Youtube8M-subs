they have customizable alerts so you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
really key when you're considering a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.500 
really key when you're considering a
home<00:01:10.830> security<00:01:11.280> camera<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
home security camera you want to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
home security camera you want to
approximate<00:01:12.810> real<00:01:13.530> time<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.549> you're

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
approximate real time so that if you're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
approximate real time so that if you're
at<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.330> office<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:15.960> away<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.290> vacation<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
at your office or away on vacation you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
at your office or away on vacation you
know<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> happening<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
know that something is happening at your

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
know that something is happening at your
house<00:01:19.500> basically<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> moment<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.970> happens

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
house basically the moment it happens

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.140 
house basically the moment it happens
another<00:01:22.320> important<00:01:22.770> consideration<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
another important consideration is the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.690 
another important consideration is the
quality<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:25.290> video<00:01:25.619> feed<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> want

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
quality of your video feed if you want

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
quality of your video feed if you want
live<00:01:27.090> streaming<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> really

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
live streaming or if you want a really

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.660 
live streaming or if you want a really
clear<00:01:29.900> recorded<00:01:30.900> video<00:01:31.259> clip<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.890> might<00:01:32.430> want

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
clear recorded video clip you might want

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.920 
clear recorded video clip you might want
HD<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.750> typically<00:01:34.790> 720p<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:36.030> 1080p

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
HD so that's typically 720p or 1080p

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.859 
HD so that's typically 720p or 1080p
obviously<00:01:37.729> 1080<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.360> highest<00:01:39.689> resolution

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
obviously 1080 is the highest resolution

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
obviously 1080 is the highest resolution
so<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:40.920> likely<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> clearer

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
so you're more likely to get a clearer

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.200 
so you're more likely to get a clearer
image<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.979> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> spotty

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
image but if you have kind of a spotty

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
image but if you have kind of a spotty
Wi-Fi<00:01:45.509> connection<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.530> could<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.100> eat

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Wi-Fi connection it could actually eat

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
Wi-Fi connection it could actually eat
up<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.729> ton<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.939> bandwidth<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> cause

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
up a ton of bandwidth and cause

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560 
up a ton of bandwidth and cause
significant<00:01:50.100> lag<00:01:50.220> times<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:51.000> where<00:01:51.180> VGA

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
significant lag times that's where VGA

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.010 
significant lag times that's where VGA
standard-definition<00:01:52.759> 640<00:01:53.759> by<00:01:53.880> 480<00:01:54.180> cameras

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
standard-definition 640 by 480 cameras

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.850 
standard-definition 640 by 480 cameras
come<00:01:55.259> into<00:01:55.470> play

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
come into play

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.470 
come into play
so<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:55.980> usually<00:01:56.130> cost<00:01:56.520> less<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.120> great

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
so they usually cost less which is great

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.830 
so they usually cost less which is great
but<00:01:58.080> they<00:01:58.230> also<00:01:58.380> require<00:01:59.100> less<00:01:59.460> bandwidth<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but they also require less bandwidth the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
but they also require less bandwidth the
downside<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.130> video<00:02:02.340> quality<00:02:02.520> isn't

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
downside is that the video quality isn't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.430 
downside is that the video quality isn't
as<00:02:03.240> clear<00:02:03.660> but<00:02:03.870> if<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
as clear but if you're really just

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.250 
as clear but if you're really just
looking<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> capture<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.700> general<00:02:06.510> image<00:02:06.930> or

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
looking to capture a general image or

looking to capture a general image or
video<00:02:07.500> stream<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.070> what's<00:02:08.250> happening<00:02:08.729> they

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
video stream of what's happening they

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.310 
video stream of what's happening they
can<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.570> good<00:02:09.840> option

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
can be a really really good option

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.260 
can be a really really good option
something<00:02:11.039> else<00:02:11.340> worth<00:02:11.550> considering<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
something else worth considering is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.750 
something else worth considering is
