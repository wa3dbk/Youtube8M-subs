from sweden to mexico valley the main
difference<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> tire<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
difference is the tire we can see that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.979 
difference is the tire we can see that
in<00:00:43.110> sweden<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> mainly<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.980> stud<00:00:44.460> older<00:00:44.989> when

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in sweden it's mainly a stud older when

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.440 
in sweden it's mainly a stud older when
we<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> mexico<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.370> proper<00:00:47.730> tire

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
we go to mexico then it's a proper tire

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.549 
we go to mexico then it's a proper tire
with<00:00:48.750> rubber<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
different button with blocks and a lot

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
different button with blocks and a lot
of<00:00:52.500> grooves<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.309> evacuate<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of grooves to just evacuate all the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.869 
of grooves to just evacuate all the
loose<00:00:54.750> gravel<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> driver<00:00:56.640> i

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
loose gravel and get to the driver i

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
loose gravel and get to the driver i
mean<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> grip<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.770> coming

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
mean a good way but the grip is coming

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
mean a good way but the grip is coming
just<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> rubber<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> blocks<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.629> just

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
just from the rubber and blocks not just

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
just from the rubber and blocks not just
a<00:01:00.899> blister<00:01:01.199> back<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> sweden<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.219> also<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
a blister back in sweden it's also a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.369 
a blister back in sweden it's also a
very<00:01:02.910> rough<00:01:03.180> rally<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
very rough rally so we have a lot of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.660 
very rough rally so we have a lot of
reinforcements<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.549> avoid

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
reinforcements on the side to avoid

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.410 
reinforcements on the side to avoid
contact<00:01:07.490> because<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.670> makes<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:08.939> compared

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
contact because it makes you go compared

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
contact because it makes you go compared
to<00:01:09.540> sweden<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> temperature<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.680> higher

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to sweden the temperature is much higher

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
to sweden the temperature is much higher
we<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.640> run<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> mexico<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.600> much<00:01:12.780> bigger

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
we have to run in mexico a much bigger

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
we have to run in mexico a much bigger
radiator<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.000> use<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.390> sweden

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
radiator than the one we use in sweden

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
radiator than the one we use in sweden
this<00:01:16.350> radiator<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.159> allow<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> engine<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this radiator will allow the engine to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
this radiator will allow the engine to
run<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.049> lower<00:01:19.229> temperature<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
run a much lower temperature which is a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
run a much lower temperature which is a
really<00:01:20.640> important<00:01:21.119> factor<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.890> mexico

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
really important factor in mexico

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
really important factor in mexico
compared<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> Sweden<00:01:23.790> where<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> cold

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
compared to Sweden where the cold

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
compared to Sweden where the cold
temperature<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.470> allow<00:01:25.650> us<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> run<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> very

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
temperature just allow us to run a very

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.999 
temperature just allow us to run a very
small<00:01:26.759> radiator<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.530> engine<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
small radiator to get the engine in the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.220 
small radiator to get the engine in the
right<00:01:29.159> temperature

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.080 

the<00:01:33.230> other<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.740> would<00:01:34.400> say<00:01:34.550> main<00:01:34.730> difference

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
the other I would say main difference

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.080 
the other I would say main difference
between<00:01:35.260> Sweden<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.350> Mexico<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:37.010> in<00:01:37.280> Sweden

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
between Sweden and Mexico is in Sweden

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.640 
between Sweden and Mexico is in Sweden
because<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.660> snow<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:39.230> car<00:01:39.410> can<00:01:39.620> be

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
because of the snow that the car can be
