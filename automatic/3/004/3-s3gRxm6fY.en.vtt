00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
starting a mythbusters-style series of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.680 
starting a mythbusters-style series of
videos<00:00:04.920> where<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.490> take<00:00:05.730> your<00:00:06.000> questions<00:00:06.480> of

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
videos where I take your questions of

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.360 
videos where I take your questions of
things<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.140> might<00:00:07.379> not<00:00:07.410> be<00:00:07.589> very<00:00:07.980> widely

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
things that might not be very widely

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.250 
things that might not be very widely
known<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.210> either<00:00:09.480> prove<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.870> they're<00:00:10.019> true

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
known and either prove that they're true

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.379 
known and either prove that they're true
or<00:00:10.440> not<00:00:10.710> true<00:00:11.010> I've<00:00:11.309> had<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.849> video<00:00:12.059> prepared

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
or not true I've had this video prepared

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.850 
or not true I've had this video prepared
for<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> little<00:00:12.990> while<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.380> maybe<00:00:13.559> think<00:00:13.799> of

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
for a little while so maybe think of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.010 
for a little while so maybe think of
this<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.219> episode<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:15.089> 5<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:15.450> something

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
this as episode point 5 or something

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
this as episode point 5 or something
where<00:00:16.470> we're<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.039> taking<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> look<00:00:17.490> at

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
where we're going to be taking a look at

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.300 
where we're going to be taking a look at
stability<00:00:17.940> bonuses<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:18.960> weapons<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.740> general

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
stability bonuses on weapons in general

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
stability bonuses on weapons in general
to<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
to see what they do or do not do the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.670 
to see what they do or do not do the
bonuses<00:00:23.130> we'll<00:00:23.310> look<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.609> today<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:23.939> rodeo

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
bonuses we'll look at today are rodeo

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.170 
bonuses we'll look at today are rodeo
counterbalance<00:00:25.680> persistence<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> perfect

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
counterbalance persistence and perfect

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
counterbalance persistence and perfect
balance<00:00:27.359> we're<00:00:28.199> basically<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> look<00:00:28.980> at

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
balance we're basically going to look at

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
balance we're basically going to look at
the<00:00:29.250> before<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> after<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.720> using<00:00:31.109> these

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the before and the after of using these

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470 
the before and the after of using these
bonuses<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.980> we'll<00:00:32.189> start<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.700> persistence

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
bonuses and we'll start with persistence

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
bonuses and we'll start with persistence
persistence<00:00:34.410> makes<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> fire<00:00:35.640> more

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
persistence makes it so you fire more

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
persistence makes it so you fire more
accurately<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.950> people

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
accurately over time a lot of people

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
accurately over time a lot of people
have<00:00:38.309> interpreted<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> mean<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.540> your

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
have interpreted this to mean that your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
have interpreted this to mean that your
weapon<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.530> less<00:00:40.800> recoil<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.640> more

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
weapon will have less recoil or more

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
weapon will have less recoil or more
stability<00:00:42.540> over<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.230> being<00:00:43.410> fired

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
stability over time when being fired

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
stability over time when being fired
well<00:00:44.610> let's<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> look<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
well let's take a look here we have a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.729 
well let's take a look here we have a
Sahara<00:00:47.340> auto<00:00:47.700> rifle<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.420> persistence<00:00:49.230> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Sahara auto rifle with persistence we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
Sahara auto rifle with persistence we
fire<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.010> without<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.579> bonuses<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
fire it without any bonuses and it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360 
fire it without any bonuses and it
recoils<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.289> reacts<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.250> you'd

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
recoils and reacts in a way that you'd

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
recoils and reacts in a way that you'd
imagine<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> high<00:00:54.059> rate<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> fire<00:00:54.420> auto<00:00:54.870> rifle

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
imagine a high rate of fire auto rifle

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.750 
imagine a high rate of fire auto rifle
would<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> goes<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:56.489> over<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
would just kind of goes all over the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
would just kind of goes all over the
place<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.930> grab<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> persistence

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
place now if we grab the persistence

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
place now if we grab the persistence
bonus<00:00:59.219> well<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:01.020> much<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.620> happens<00:01:02.160> when

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
bonus well not much really happens when

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
bonus well not much really happens when
we're<00:01:02.489> aiming<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> sights<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.510> fact<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
we're aiming down the sights in fact it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
we're aiming down the sights in fact it
looks<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.470> essentially<00:01:04.979> nothing<00:01:05.610> has

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
looks like essentially nothing has

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
looks like essentially nothing has
changed<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.439> accuracy<00:01:08.189> in

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
changed this is because accuracy in

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
changed this is because accuracy in
destiny<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.360> related<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.140> recoil<00:01:10.650> or

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
destiny is not related to your recoil or

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
destiny is not related to your recoil or
your<00:01:11.280> stability<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
your stability in any way it is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
your stability in any way it is
something<00:01:13.290> different<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.250> accuracy

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
something different what accuracy

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.960 
something different what accuracy
exactly<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.320> still<00:01:16.619> somewhat<00:01:17.159> debated<00:01:17.640> but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
exactly is is still somewhat debated but

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.249 
exactly is is still somewhat debated but
a<00:01:18.030> decent<00:01:18.390> amount<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.600> people<00:01:18.780> equate

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a decent amount of people equate

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
a decent amount of people equate
accuracy<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> bullet<00:01:20.580> curve<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.479> bullets

however<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> bass<00:01:24.630> lesson<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.290> learn<00:01:25.560> from

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
however the bass lesson to learn from

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
however the bass lesson to learn from
persistence<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.240> help

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
persistence is that it will not help

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
persistence is that it will not help
your<00:01:27.990> stability<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:29.040> nor<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
your stability at all nor will it have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
your stability at all nor will it have
any<00:01:30.540> effect<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.350> recoil<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.610> place

any effect on your recoil one place
where<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.180> notice<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.140> bit<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> an

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
where we can notice a little bit of an

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
where we can notice a little bit of an
effect<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.189> persistence<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.270> hip

effect with persistence is with hip
firing<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.920> Theon's<00:01:38.189> epilogue<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.790> an

firing will use a Theon's epilogue as an
example<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.710> 15<00:01:41.220> or

your recoil so at least this says that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
your recoil so at least this says that
it<00:02:02.189> does<00:02:02.340> something<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.909> recoil<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it does something to your recoil so

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
it does something to your recoil so
we'll<00:02:04.259> fire<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> weapon<00:02:04.920> without<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> bonus

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it looks like the bounce between

it looks like the bounce between
individual<00:02:20.730> shots<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.239> slightly<00:02:21.720> smaller

next up we have perfect balance which

increases your stability surely this
must<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.420> something<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.380> let's<00:03:07.650> fire<00:03:07.950> our

must do something so let's fire our

summoner auto rifle without perfect
balance<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.950> first<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.550> recoil

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
balance to first see what the recoil

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.520 
balance to first see what the recoil
pattern<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.200> seems<00:03:13.440> pretty

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
pattern is like and it seems pretty

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.190 
pattern is like and it seems pretty
reasonable<00:03:14.010> we'll<00:03:14.940> tack<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.450> perfect<00:03:15.900> balance

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
reasonable we'll tack on perfect balance

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.960 
reasonable we'll tack on perfect balance
and<00:03:16.380> we<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.740> definitely<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> there's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and we can definitely see that there's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.820 
and we can definitely see that there's
some<00:03:18.240> difference<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:18.960> we<00:03:19.500> don't<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:19.800> over

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
some difference there we don't go over

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740 
some difference there we don't go over
this<00:03:20.250> sort<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.640> line<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.360> wall<00:03:21.570> anymore

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
this sort of line on the wall anymore

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.290 
this sort of line on the wall anymore
but<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.380> weapon<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.800> fairly<00:03:23.100> stable<00:03:23.520> as<00:03:23.880> is

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
but this weapon is fairly stable as is

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.150 
but this weapon is fairly stable as is
if<00:03:24.870> we're<00:03:25.080> looking<00:03:25.170> at<00:03:25.470> something<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:25.830> this

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
if we're looking at something like this

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 
if we're looking at something like this
just<00:03:26.610> firing<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> wall<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.840> tell<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
just firing at a wall we can tell that

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.020 
just firing at a wall we can tell that
it<00:03:28.320> does<00:03:28.500> something<00:03:28.800> if<00:03:29.130> we<00:03:29.550> want<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.820> look<00:03:29.880> at

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
it does something if we want to look at

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
it does something if we want to look at
something<00:03:30.210> like<00:03:30.420> yielders<00:03:30.840> hammer<00:03:31.110> we<00:03:31.350> can

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
something like yielders hammer we can

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.960 
something like yielders hammer we can
see<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.920> difference<00:03:32.310> between<00:03:32.460> having

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
see the difference between having

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.000 
see the difference between having
perfect<00:03:33.510> balance<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:33.990> not<00:03:34.260> having<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.800> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
perfect balance and not having it a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.190 
perfect balance and not having it a
little<00:03:35.250> bit<00:03:35.430> more<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:36.330> are<00:03:36.480> hitting<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> upper

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
little bit more we are hitting the upper

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.080 
little bit more we are hitting the upper
part<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> wall<00:03:37.770> without<00:03:38.040> perfect<00:03:38.550> balance

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
part of the wall without perfect balance

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.450 
part of the wall without perfect balance
and<00:03:39.240> with<00:03:39.720> perfect<00:03:40.140> balance<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.590> fire<00:03:40.890> even

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
and with perfect balance we fire even

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.130 
and with perfect balance we fire even
more<00:03:41.820> shots<00:03:42.180> than<00:03:42.420> compared<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.840> when<00:03:43.020> we

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
more shots than compared to when we

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.110 
more shots than compared to when we
didn't<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:44.190> even<00:03:44.280> reach<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.820> top

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
didn't and we don't even reach that top

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.780 
didn't and we don't even reach that top
part<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.600> wall<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:47.010> definitely<00:03:47.310> is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
part of the wall so there definitely is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.900 
part of the wall so there definitely is
some<00:03:48.480> kind<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.050> benefit<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.130> last<00:03:50.370> bonus<00:03:50.670> we

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
some kind of benefit the last bonus we

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.700 
some kind of benefit the last bonus we
have<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.360> counter<00:03:51.960> balance<00:03:52.320> where<00:03:52.530> this

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
have is counter balance where this

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.280 
have is counter balance where this
weapon<00:03:53.040> has<00:03:53.250> increased<00:03:53.850> stability<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
weapon has increased stability so it

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
weapon has increased stability so it
sounds<00:03:55.560> pretty<00:03:55.740> similar<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.130> perfect<00:03:56.610> balance

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
sounds pretty similar to perfect balance

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.670 
sounds pretty similar to perfect balance
it<00:03:57.060> should<00:03:57.270> have<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> similar<00:03:57.960> effect<00:03:58.110> right

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it should have a similar effect right

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.790 
it should have a similar effect right
well<00:03:59.280> let's<00:03:59.730> see<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:01.020> are<00:04:01.050> firing<00:04:01.440> a

sargon heavy machine gun without the
bonus<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.740> over<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:04.980> place<00:04:05.220> as<00:04:05.460> any

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
high rate of fire heavy machine gun is

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.270 
high rate of fire heavy machine gun is
will<00:04:08.610> pick<00:04:08.760> up<00:04:08.910> counter<00:04:09.300> balance<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.890> Wow

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
will pick up counter balance and Wow

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.910 
will pick up counter balance and Wow
we<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.970> actually<00:04:12.540> see<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.110> noticeable

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
we can actually see a noticeable

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800 
we can actually see a noticeable
difference<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.550> our<00:04:14.820> recoil<00:04:15.420> pattern

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
difference in our recoil pattern

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.990 
difference in our recoil pattern
specifically<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.980> completely<00:04:17.580> gets<00:04:17.760> rid

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
specifically that it completely gets rid

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.870 
specifically that it completely gets rid
of<00:04:18.030> any<00:04:18.420> left<00:04:18.960> to<00:04:19.170> right<00:04:19.470> recoil<00:04:20.070> our<00:04:20.400> recoil

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
of any left to right recoil our recoil

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.540 
of any left to right recoil our recoil
is<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.299> only<00:04:21.660> up<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.350> down<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:23.190> doesn't<00:04:23.460> like

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
is now only up and down it doesn't like

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.430 
is now only up and down it doesn't like
to<00:04:23.580> actually<00:04:23.910> reduce<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.480> amount<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.050> recoil

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
to actually reduce the amount of recoil

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.740 
to actually reduce the amount of recoil
it's<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.040> know<00:04:26.160> still<00:04:26.460> pretty<00:04:26.670> bouncy<00:04:27.150> but

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
it's you know still pretty bouncy but

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.330 
it's you know still pretty bouncy but
now<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:27.990> only<00:04:28.260> need<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.860> account<00:04:29.190> for

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
now we only need to account for

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.850 
now we only need to account for
up-and-down<00:04:30.270> recoil<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.230> a<00:04:31.290> nice<00:04:31.470> bonus<00:04:31.650> to

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
up-and-down recoil it's a nice bonus to

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.290 
up-and-down recoil it's a nice bonus to
have<00:04:32.010> because<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.430> makes<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.940> weapon<00:04:33.270> that

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
have because it makes the weapon that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.140 
have because it makes the weapon that
much<00:04:33.810> easier<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> control<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:35.940> what<00:04:36.120> I
