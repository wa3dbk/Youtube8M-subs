Chapter 1 ~Withdrawal~

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.910
It was quiet in Valiance Keep. Only few of the dockworkers were visible in the mist.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
Wrapped up in my cloak, I sat down on the hard boards of the huge transport ship

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.179
and waited impatiently for its departure.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.629
More and more soldiers boarded the ship and spread out as best they could on board.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.190
I looked up wearily, watching the various characters as they slowly approached the ship.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.429
The hooves of a large Draenei Warrior clattered loudly on the deck of the ship and fell silent

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.729
only when he went below deck. Members of all peoples united

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.940
in the Alliance were now represented on the ship. Even a few Tauren wearing the symbol of the circle of Cenarius

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.820
were on board. The last soldier to set foot on the deck was wearing

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.560
heavy armor and a long black cloak. In his right hand he carried a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.990
helmet and with his left he held his hood that he had pulled down over his face.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.980
Because of his height, I took the cloak wearer to be a Night Elf. But why

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.470
this masquerade? Usually Night Elves were said to be very handsome and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.870
liked to show their distinctive fashion sense even in wartime.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.640
He turned to me, took a few steps and sat silently next to me.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.800
"Okay, we've got them all," roared the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.900
harbour master at the helm, who nodded back and signalled to his

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.500
crew to gather the ropes. The ship departed slowly and headed for Stormwind.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.600
I sighed quietly and straightened my cape. "Finally we're returning home, aren't we?"

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.119
The night elf slowly turned away from me. "It's a long way my friend. Why

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.739
do you take such a detour through Stormwind to get home?" The Night Elf remained silent.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.580
"I'm sorry if my presence on this ship disturbs you my Lord, only you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.130
need to know that I, as a warlock ... "You're not disturbing me," hissed the Elf

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.990
quietly, thereby interrupting my sentence. His voice had a very strange sound.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.390
It seemed as if an army of elves whispered within it. "You are

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.680
the least of my concerns on this journey." I looked at him quizzically and asked: "I have heard this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.130
kind of deviation of your voice before. You are one of the warriors who are called Death Knights,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.640
right?" "Death Knights ... what a horrible description of what we are. We are

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.740
neither really dead, nor are we honorable knights."

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.750
It seemed as if the long trip would still become interesting.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.390
"Many Death Knights have served well in the Northend campaign, sir. Why shouldn't

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.849
you be entitled to the fame of a knight?" "That is very simple, human, because our

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.120
bodies have walked this world for too long already. The losses we caused the Scourge and the Lich

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.970
King were created by ourselves before our liberation.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.970
You could even consider it a zero bill." "I see ... Well, at least

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.099
you decided for the right side and became victorious. The Lich King is dead

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:42.099
and cannot reign over you any more." "Is that so? On the day when the King

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.040
of the Undead was killed, I suddenly felt a new presence on the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.040
Frozen Throne. I'm not so sure that we will not be controlled like this

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.620
again." "I am sure that it will not happen, otherwise King Varian would not have

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.400
let us go home." The Night Elf snorted disparagingly: "You trust in the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.510
word of your king, and for that you have my respect. But may I remind you

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.510
that even royal blood is not free of errors?"

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.150
Obviously the Night Elf knew that the Lich King himself once

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.940
descended from royal blood. Arthas Menethil, Prince of Lordaeron, once had been a proud

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.100
paladin before he became the worst enemy, against which the Alliance ultimately

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.660
triumphed nevertheless. "No, that is not needed my

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.660
Lord, certainly not."
