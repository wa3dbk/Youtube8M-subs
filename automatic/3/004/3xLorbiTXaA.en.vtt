00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.669
 hello this is my king of f3 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.040
 has presented a lot of problems 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:13.450
 since I buy it problems such as 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.910
 that the radio is bad the program does not 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.590
 reproduce what follow the principle of our 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.910
 sound problem to the interior in the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.830
 board here I understand why the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.250
 plastics between same quality of a car 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 normal chinese car 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.680
 but problems that bother me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.250
 currently they are the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.070
 the airbag indicator I do not know if it can 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.600
 burst at any time and it's not going to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.080
 operate the moment a shock which 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.400
 generates a security problem and this 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.760
 vehicle has as you can see 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.000
 currently has 30,000 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.070
 of 4,000 kilometers presents around 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
 of the 30 thousand kilometers in 8,000 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.000
 kilometer 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.060
 and another problem that also has is that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.800
 the light of the check-in jing turns on now 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.140
 it's not learned but I have another and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.360
 where it comes out it turned on the light more or less 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.430
 how much of the 30,000 kilometers when 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.860
 started this problem the service 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.340
 after-sale he told me he will take it 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.549
 so that what we want 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 and it's taken by a brand dealer 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.530
 what you see 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.320
 in your engine is very holy that was where 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.429
 I bought it and there the truth is that the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.719
 answer that they gave me they want that 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.149
 they have to do a checkup which 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.640
 I had to pay for something that I find 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.560
 that it should not be because the vehicle has 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360
 presented problems since I bought it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 has presented a problem that he had to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.390
 change the front two wheels because 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 the vehicle is charged is charged 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.009
 but as six alignments 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.049
 and the problem definitely the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.090
 assumption quinza torroja disorders 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.429
 problems but other problems too 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.719
 that as soon as he alone is for example 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.719
 you can see here the seatbelt 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 this pink 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 it faded with the sun and yet the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.680
 mine is red 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.740
 other problems are destroying the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.630
 rear seats which we can follow 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.420
 problems also with the mirrors that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.070
 they vibrate when you go on the road what 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 which hinders and generates a problem of 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.210
 security because it does not let you see well 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.180
 vehicles that come back 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.230
 problems that I from the beginning and 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 The mirror theme was never corrected 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.569
 sound problems in the body that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.610
 crunching currently also has 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.239
 problems with I do not know if they go the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.780
 filing cabinets but they sound creak when 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.780
 one is walking 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:51.060
 because the vehicle of a sound 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 constant body 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.129
 we can bring the subject of the seats 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.220
 appreciate the reflection I do not know I'm going back 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.220
 of the inside 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.440
 but what can be appreciated is more is 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.850
 cracking what I'm seeing is 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.400
 is splitting the seat and they can 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.470
 see this vehicle as I told you have 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.470
 currently 34 thousand kilometers 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.050
 I think I would not tell a 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.000
 august of the brand although well 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.000
 they responded with the guarantee 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.880
 when the day hard because the guarantee 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.370
 are 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.670
 I think it's 50,000 kilometers or two 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.070
 years and I spend time with the car and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.830
 the two years passed even though he has less 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.810
 50,000 kilometers I have no problems no 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.240
 I have a guarantee that this type of 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.180
 problem that your center factory fault 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.180
 engine engine check engine 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.570
 70 the light 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.310
 with the practical that are problems that do not 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.150
 they should happen a car is new 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.400
 practically 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.980
 way to be another problem the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.720
 safety belts began to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.600
 disarm your personation the talk as 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.300
 you can see there 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.750
 it started how is that area in the 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.720
 belt is also 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.700
 with problems but his aesthetic problem 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.160
 but I still believe that a new vehicle does not 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.720
 should I present these problems myself 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.150
 I upload this video because 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.920
 I insisted on the brand so they could see 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.900
 this airbag problem and check in 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.340
 which are the ones that worry me most and 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.810
 Now the subject of the seat is to start 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.810
 split the seats to start breaking 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.710
 and the mark in the background told me sorry 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.620
 spent 50,000 or two years of 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.070
 therefore this guarantee is off 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.070
 the guarantee 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.280
 this is mainly because they go up 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.100
 Brand videos uploading models 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.190
 new 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.360
 showing yields vehicle 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.580
 when the understanding that rendered 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.710
 around 13 14 kilometers and city 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.380
 the truth is that it yields 10 km pulling 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.600
 for the 11 in city on highway of 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.270
 yield about 13 kilometers 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.000
 that had 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.340
 so that another user is looking for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.940
 a green vehicle are going 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.070
 which 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.310
 the real quality of the tri ass of this 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.310
 brand 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.040
 I hope you serve them thinking about taking a 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.860
 decision regarding the shortcut a vehicle 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.140
 It helps me not to trust camera 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.500
 brand new and less a Chinese brand 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.510
 because the car is very nice has 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.330
 high equipment in the letter things 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.009
 but 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.590
 has presented problems constantly 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.320
 between vehicles 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.540
 I have had facebook 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.230
 vehicle before which I can not 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.550
 say today this not with a new vehicle 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.570
 so that 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.570
 but that it serves them
