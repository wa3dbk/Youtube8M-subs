00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.980 
2.3 maybe even ICS and jelly bean but I
just<00:01:17.210> want<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.570> upgrade<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:19.360> more<00:01:20.360> faster

factory setting I believe is to route
the<00:01:29.060> phone<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.630> then<00:01:29.990> after<00:01:30.440> routing<00:01:30.920> it

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990

the phone and then after routing it
possibly<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.020> might<00:01:33.229> need<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.619> unlock<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
possibly I might need to unlock the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.440 
possibly I might need to unlock the
bootloader<00:01:36.460> but<00:01:37.460> hopefully<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.850> don't<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.390> I

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
remember what it's called

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
remember what it's called
so<00:02:16.080> still<00:02:16.290> waiting<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.830> boot<00:02:19.010> meantime

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so still waiting for it to boot meantime

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.000 
so still waiting for it to boot meantime
if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.780> decide<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.739> phone

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
if you do decide to get this phone

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.000 
if you do decide to get this phone
because<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.970> smart<00:02:24.209> sheep<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.830> is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
because you see the smart sheep this is

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.460 
because you see the smart sheep this is
actually<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> international<00:02:27.330> model<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.930> x8

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
actually the international model the x8

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.320 
actually the international model the x8
so<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.220> doesn't<00:02:29.519> support<00:02:30.060> 3G<00:02:30.840> speeds<00:02:31.200> on

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so it doesn't support 3G speeds on

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.940 
so it doesn't support 3G speeds on
t-mobile<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.930> don't<00:02:34.319> even<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
t-mobile I don't even know if it

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
supports 3G speeds for AT&amp;T but this was

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.059 
supports 3G speeds for AT&amp;T but this was
about<00:02:40.590> unlocked<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.769> remember<00:02:46.769> when<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
about unlocked and so remember when you

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.580 
about unlocked and so remember when you
