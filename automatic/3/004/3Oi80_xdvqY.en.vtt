00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.310
 cross 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 Here I bring you chapter number 4 of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.090
 gaming craft and we are with sheen 's 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 short my dear subscriber that is going to 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.710
 teach one of those maps as you see him 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.960
 Wears a carmen skin from the CG or 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.020
 software and I took the locus drone from 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.849
 locus team and software because 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.040
 this theme of these skins this is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.560
 because we are going to show a map that has 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.260
 done without of incredible short work is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.480
 the blood road map what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 you will surely know because it has come out 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 already in two software games and well the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.859
 truth is that the map I liked 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.510
 much as you see is incredibly well 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.070
 done in detail the spaces are 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 also great they will remember them very much 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 to play these games on this map and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.579
 all areas where there are weapons 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.679
 let's say where the grenades are 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.499
 sniper and all this he has put trunks 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.719
 so that people can catch the bow and 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.890
 arrows and well well play with 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.629
 also with his friends he told me 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 that his friends also come a lot to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.920
 play this would be the reappearance zone 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.409
 of one team and good in the other 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 side is also made the other zone 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.110
 This area of â€‹â€‹the windows also 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 map is great because in the game is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.060
 same and we can jump 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.500
 in the game and good reminded me 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 very much to play on this map has me 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.400
 liked it a lot as you see the area 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.040
 bridge that had as a kind of 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 destroyed train has also recreated 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 the one a little bit and it's there in flames 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.910
 even really very good that detail 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.500
 and good surely you have been 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.600
 firing from here to protect the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.820
 sniper or the bow to me has reminded me 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.170
 very much to that since it has gone from this 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.690
 position to protect the area a bit 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.130
 from the middle of the map and good from here 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.680
 you see also the area is where the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.940
 good flamethrower good all 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.280
 details are great all 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 Coverages are exactly the same 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.900
 would be what is the reappearance zone 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.640
 of grenades that will remind you very much 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.260
 to the game and from here you could also 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.210
 see the whole area in the middle of the map 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.750
 it's great the map I liked 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.640
 very much also because I would say it is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.350
 the map on which I have most played order 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.869
 gears of war 3 because I liked 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.270
 quite this map and you could cover 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.070
 well in that area of stairs and good 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.709
 As you can see, there are even some 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.840
 beds so that people friends of 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.400
 'without short they come here to play and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.540
 Well, I liked that very much 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.489
 detail 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.879
 here this would be the area where 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.069
 reappear flamethrower I will teach you 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.659
 the whole downtown area where we are 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.340
 just under the bridge that was 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.319
 commenting that good and surely 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.659
 you will know all the coverages are 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.569
 practically the same even the columns 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.010
 these side covers even by 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.170
 here there was also some detail of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.780
 map and good are the area where the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.030
 sniper the bow that good is that it is 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.799
 exactly the same as what the map would be 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 original I liked it very much all 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.540
 the covers all the details is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.030
 really great and the theme of spaces 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.769
 the spaces are pretty enough 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 difficult to recreate in this type of 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.180
 maps that we are like simulating others 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.700
 games and the truth is that it has been 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.470
 quite similar of spaces and in what 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.970
 which is the map in size to what is the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.040
 original game I liked a lot 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.409
 that detail and good as you see here 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.939
 It has like bars and an area for 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.709
 come out on the other hand and is that it is in the 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.030
 short was doing as a kind 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.400
 train to travel to the map 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.659
 directly that is a good idea and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.189
 well over here the other area of 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.840
 reappearance of grenades and we're also going 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.060
 to see the area where the other reappears 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.380
 team so you can see all the details 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.030
 from here you can see 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.560
 from the middle zone the map is 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.990
 exactly the same as the blood trail of 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.760
 gears of war 3 at least as I say 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.190
 also came out in another game of the saga 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.750
 but good the last remastering in 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.970
 hd they have put it with good graphics 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.120
 exactly like this one and good here 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.130
 is the other area of reappearance of 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.990
 equipment the CG comes out on one side and the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.730
 crazy in the other you already know and good has 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.440
 very much liked the recreation of this 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.000
 map I do not know you will be there 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.640
 remembered those hours of vices at least 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.980
 to me if I love incredible software 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 I'm a fan of that saga and this map 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.030
 has loved it very much I think it is very 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.290
 well for the subject of details and for the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.030
 theme of spaces I do not know what you think 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.170
 you hope that you leave all 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.480
