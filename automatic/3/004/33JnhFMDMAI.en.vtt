00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.400
 com 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.850
 but 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.820
 ok so we then have the refrain in 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.559
 which we have the seventh chords then 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.450
 B flat B we say the first 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.770
 guitar only does power chords 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.800
 so always considering what we have 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.070
 the sixth king we have the seventh we drink 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 7 in a seventh chromatism the flat e 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 then we go to soul and then again 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.410
 then playing parties refrain 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.910
 and this then the part following the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.040
 refrain at risk of the refrain 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.140
 practically it was the part below 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.520
 to the theme the one played with place to which 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 he would then do this part here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 there's this guitar riff with the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.340
 itself open to the refrain then beyond 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 to the power chords part we have 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.170
 overdubbed another part of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.850
 guitar with the rotary in and in the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.280
 what we say are the agreements we say 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.130
 in positions a little more medium high like this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 to be understood to mean better 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.810
 harmony, in short, to be better understood 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.580
 the harmony and the precise positions I have 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.580
 these are used 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.829
 help used the flat seventh 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.829
 fifth flat 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.810
 that seventh sharp fifth 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.470
 or 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.160
 and then we have the riff of the second 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.630
 verse that would be this here that I have 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.760
 played with the pick up not the mini 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.980
 anne banking here at the bridge but the fourth 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.200
 location that uses central and bridge 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.200
 that there would be this 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.469
 then the ref 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.469
 the first riff of the first 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.709
 under this rich there is the second time 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:40.510
 also an overdubbed guitar flaw 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:41.980
 that would be why I decided to 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.440
 oversee this part to get more 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 push to raise the upbeat a lot 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.950
 more rhythmic and therefore we say 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.230
 taking this into continuous respect of 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.050
 semichrome this thing gave me a lot 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.370
 very rhythmically and so we have 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.080
 decided to add this goes to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.569
 this other part of guitar then 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 we have the second interesting 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.790
 refrain that I have harmonized so 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.370
 a little different always with using 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.299
 power chords mixed with punished guitar 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.040
 with the sound with the rotary ok part of the 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.040
 power chords would be this 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 which would then be 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.610
 two full 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.509
 be be more 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.010
 in the back do do bemolle 15 and is flat 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.080
 the springs and then there is this sentence that 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.930
 it is practically played and designed on mib 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.490
 springs seventh okay then voicings 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.400
 which he used instead for this 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.540
 second refrain are these here 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.240
 takes I played three eleventh mi 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.390
 flat eleventh then minor 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.050
 eleventh flat seventh fifth 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.490
 sharp sharp flat 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.310
 then that of the B flat 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.919
 if I divide, it is B seventh and then me 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.849
 week I flat seventh ninth and the 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.800
 sentence in fact is this 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:27.930
 right on the E flat I thought of as 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.960
 evening leader in the link you find 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.819
 below you can download the backing 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.560
 track and transcription then all 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.410
 parts that I played and therefore who I am 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.849
 present in the original video I hope to 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.310
 help you 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.650
 not even publish videos maybe in 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.060
 which you play all the parts of 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.800
 so guitar came we can too 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.940
 discuss together so we can update 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.940
 here always on the musical 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.290
 is
