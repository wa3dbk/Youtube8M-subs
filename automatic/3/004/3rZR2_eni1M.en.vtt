principles are still the same um we're
let<00:03:25.260> word<00:03:25.440> when<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.489> switching<00:03:26.850> as<00:03:26.940> much<00:03:27.120> which

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
let word when I switching as much which

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.120 
let word when I switching as much which
is<00:03:27.660> which<00:03:28.020> means<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.380> were<00:03:28.560> more<00:03:28.709> aggressive

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
is which means that were more aggressive

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.800 
is which means that were more aggressive
on<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> ball<00:03:29.520> put<00:03:29.730> more<00:03:30.000> responsibility<00:03:30.690> on

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
on the ball put more responsibility on

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.070 
on the ball put more responsibility on
the<00:03:30.900> guards<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.640> know<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.850> take<00:03:33.570> action<00:03:33.989> on

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the guards you know to take action on

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.690 
the guards you know to take action on
the<00:03:34.200> ball<00:03:34.380> rather<00:03:34.620> than<00:03:34.800> getting<00:03:35.070> pink<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the ball rather than getting pink and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.180 
the ball rather than getting pink and
then<00:03:35.820> switching<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.440> think<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> lot<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.920> that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
then switching and I think a lot of that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.290 
then switching and I think a lot of that
is<00:03:38.700> helping<00:03:38.940> us<00:03:39.060> apply<00:03:39.360> pressure

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.479 

you<00:03:45.300> know<00:03:45.450> we<00:03:45.659> tried<00:03:46.440> different<00:03:46.709> things<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.400> I

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you know we tried different things and I

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.850 
you know we tried different things and I
think<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:47.879> just<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.780> know<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.140> team<00:03:49.409> coming

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
think it's just you know a team coming

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.649 
think it's just you know a team coming

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
together you know yelling team not

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.570 
together you know yelling team not
yelling<00:03:51.900> team<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.200> years<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.620> young<00:03:52.830> team<00:03:53.099> as
