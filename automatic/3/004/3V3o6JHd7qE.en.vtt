so nice look a little unit here's your
mount<00:00:22.800> takes<00:00:23.789> two<00:00:24.350> triple<00:00:25.350> A<00:00:25.439> batteries<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
mount takes two triple A batteries and

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.240 
mount takes two triple A batteries and
which<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> pretty<00:00:28.650> cool<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> other

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
one took nine volt the previous model

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
one took nine volt the previous model
and<00:00:33.290> I've<00:00:34.290> been<00:00:34.410> pretty<00:00:34.559> impressed<00:00:34.649> with

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and I've been pretty impressed with

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.850 
and I've been pretty impressed with
little<00:00:35.219> thing<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.579> playing<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
little thing I'm not playing with it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
little thing I'm not playing with it
it's<00:00:37.860> got<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> fully<00:00:38.250> digital<00:00:38.460> interface<00:00:39.090> which

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's got a fully digital interface which

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's got a fully digital interface which
is<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.750> cool<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.500> digging<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
is really cool I'm digging that so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.900 
is really cool I'm digging that so
there's<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> lightning<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.719> sound

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
there's a lightning your sound

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
there's a lightning your sound
time-lapse<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.629> laser<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.289> point<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
time-lapse your laser you can point a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
time-lapse your laser you can point a
laser<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> front<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
laser at the front of this thing and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
laser at the front of this thing and
when<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> light<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.450> broken<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.410> trigger

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
when the light is broken it will trigger

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.049 
when the light is broken it will trigger
so<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.309> pretty<00:00:50.579> cool<00:00:50.610> stuff<00:00:50.940> with

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so you can just pretty cool stuff with

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.029 
so you can just pretty cool stuff with
that

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
that

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.650 
that
that's<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.190> HDR<00:00:53.550> mode<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.239> auto<00:00:54.390> bracketing

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that's an HDR mode for auto bracketing

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
that's an HDR mode for auto bracketing
and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> DIY<00:00:56.039> mode<00:00:56.550> which<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:57.000> above

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and then a DIY mode which is way above

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.220 
and then a DIY mode which is way above
my<00:00:57.329> head<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.859> each<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> these<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.789> a

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
my head and then each one of these has a

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
my head and then each one of these has a
submenu<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.359> click<00:01:03.570> start<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
submenu to it so you click start on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
submenu to it so you click start on
lightning<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.460> your

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
lightning and you can get your

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.000 
lightning and you can get your
sensitivity<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.049> when

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sensitivity that you want for when

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.120 
sensitivity that you want for when
you're<00:01:08.130> shooting<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> lightning<00:01:10.010> same<00:01:11.010> with

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you're shooting the lightning same with

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.320 
you're shooting the lightning same with
the<00:01:11.220> sound<00:01:11.460> trigger<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.780> forth

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the sound trigger and so on so forth

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
the sound trigger and so on so forth
this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.720> neat<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.080> unit<00:01:16.409> area<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
this is pretty neat little unit area so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.219 
this is pretty neat little unit area so
I'm<00:01:17.220> gonna<00:01:17.340> show<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> shots

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I'm gonna show you some of the shots

I've gotten with it

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.870 
I've gotten with it
coming<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.840> here

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.280 

should<00:01:25.360> mention<00:01:25.510> one<00:01:25.690> more<00:01:25.750> thing<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.140> does

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
should mention one more thing it does

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.280 
should mention one more thing it does
have<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:27.240> pretty<00:01:28.240> cool<00:01:28.390> mode<00:01:28.600> as<00:01:28.750> well

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
have a pretty cool mode as well

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.680 
have a pretty cool mode as well
a<00:01:29.350> power<00:01:29.830> saving<00:01:30.040> mode<00:01:30.370> goes<00:01:31.090> into<00:01:31.330> after<00:01:31.630> I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
a power saving mode goes into after I

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.200 
a power saving mode goes into after I
think<00:01:31.900> few<00:01:32.860> seconds<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.460> being<00:01:33.670> used<00:01:33.910> or

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
think few seconds of not being used or

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.560 
think few seconds of not being used or
when<00:01:34.360> hit<00:01:34.510> start<00:01:35.940> turns<00:01:36.940> itself<00:01:37.180> off<00:01:37.360> after

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
when hit start turns itself off after

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.830 
when hit start turns itself off after
three<00:01:38.170> seconds<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.710> save<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> battery<00:01:39.460> life

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
three seconds to save the battery life

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950 
three seconds to save the battery life
which<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.990> pretty<00:01:41.020> cool<00:01:42.300> this<00:01:43.300> indicates<00:01:43.780> when

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
which is pretty cool this indicates when

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.780 
which is pretty cool this indicates when
it's<00:01:44.080> firing<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.920> can<00:01:45.070> see<00:01:45.220> it's<00:01:45.400> picking<00:01:45.550> up

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
it's firing you can see it's picking up

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's firing you can see it's picking up
my<00:01:45.880> voice<00:01:46.090> right<00:01:46.300> now<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.600> sound<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.290> firing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
my voice right now in sound it's firing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
my voice right now in sound it's firing
over<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.990> Nero<00:01:50.350> trigger<00:01:50.530> sound<00:01:50.890> function

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.000 

test-fired

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
test-fired

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.289 
test-fired
so<00:02:00.010> yeah
