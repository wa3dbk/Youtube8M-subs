friend upstairs is i like to say if you

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.000 
friend upstairs is i like to say if you
had<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.850> 200<00:00:24.390> billion<00:00:24.720> steps<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.439> i<00:00:25.560> counted

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
had about 200 billion steps as i counted

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.439 
had about 200 billion steps as i counted
that's<00:00:26.220> how<00:00:26.340> many<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> would<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.789> really

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that's how many it would take really

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
that's how many it would take really
that<00:00:27.599> mean<00:00:27.779> yeah<00:00:28.019> try<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.740> pin<00:00:28.980> pin

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that mean yeah try that on your pin pin

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
that mean yeah try that on your pin pin
I<00:00:29.460> don't<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:29.880> it'll<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> high<00:00:30.539> well

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
I don't think it'll go that high well

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.450 
I don't think it'll go that high well
regardless<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.830> want<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> talk<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
about the Sun because researchers are

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.870 
about the Sun because researchers are
saying<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.649> they've<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:34.980> discovered<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
saying that they've now discovered that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.580 
saying that they've now discovered that
we<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> mini<00:00:36.870> ice<00:00:37.110> age<00:00:37.350> by

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
we are going to have a mini ice age by

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.299 
we are going to have a mini ice age by
2030<00:00:38.489> oh<00:00:38.760> yeah<00:00:39.540> only<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.050> 15<00:00:40.559> years<00:00:40.590> from<00:00:41.129> now

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
2030 oh yeah only like 15 years from now

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
2030 oh yeah only like 15 years from now
so<00:00:41.820> enjoy<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.660> global<00:00:42.989> warming<00:00:43.290> while<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so enjoy your global warming while it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
so enjoy your global warming while it
lasts<00:00:43.980> cause<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.460> ain't<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.789> last<00:00:44.910> we're

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
lasts cause it ain't gonna last we're

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
lasts cause it ain't gonna last we're
gonna<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.960> freezing<00:00:46.320> our<00:00:46.559> butts<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gonna be freezing our butts off the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
gonna be freezing our butts off the
longer<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> short<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> though<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
longer the short of it though is that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
longer the short of it though is that
competing<00:00:49.770> physical<00:00:50.190> cycles<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> Sun

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
competing physical cycles in the Sun

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
competing physical cycles in the Sun
will<00:00:51.420> cancel<00:00:51.660> each<00:00:51.899> other<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.890> next

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
will cancel each other out in the next

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.709 
will cancel each other out in the next
solar<00:00:53.340> cycle<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> taking<00:00:54.300> notes<00:00:54.449> because

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
solar cycle are you taking notes because

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
solar cycle are you taking notes because
what's<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.649> happen<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
what's gonna happen with that is that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
what's gonna happen with that is that
we're<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> mini<00:00:57.390> ice<00:00:57.600> age<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
we're gonna have a mini ice age like the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
we're gonna have a mini ice age like the
one<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.070> had<00:00:59.250> from<00:00:59.640> 1645<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
one that we actually had from 1645 to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.500 
one that we actually had from 1645 to
1715<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> remember<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.149> we

1715 I remember that well back then we

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
1715 I remember that well back then we
actually<00:01:03.660> had<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.170> rivers<00:01:04.530> freeze<00:01:04.739> over

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
actually had some rivers freeze over

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
actually had some rivers freeze over
that<00:01:05.339> door<00:01:05.549> normally<00:01:05.909> freeze<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
fan of cold that's why i moved to
vancouver<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.439> much<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> warmest

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
vancouver it's pretty much the warmest

United States conquered Hawaii cuz I
wish<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.299> had<00:01:15.420> conquered<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.840> first<00:01:16.259> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
wish we had conquered that first like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.010 
wish we had conquered that first like
seriously<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> u.s.<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.119> Alaska<00:01:18.600> we

seriously the u.s. can have Alaska we
just<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> Hawaii<00:01:19.740> we're<00:01:20.159> gonna<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> do

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just have Hawaii we're gonna have to do

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
just have Hawaii we're gonna have to do
the<00:01:20.820> Sun<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.470> along<00:01:22.650> with

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the Sun I don't know just go along with

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
the Sun I don't know just go along with
my<00:01:22.950> logic<00:01:23.310> entering<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> mini<00:01:24.360> ice<00:01:24.570> age<00:01:24.780> isn't

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
my logic entering a mini ice age isn't

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
my logic entering a mini ice age isn't
all<00:01:25.470> doom<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> gloom<00:01:25.920> though<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.549> there

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
all doom and gloom though because there

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
all doom and gloom though because there
could<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.270> plenty<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> good<00:01:27.930> things<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.200> come

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
that's actually lots of ways that you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
that's actually lots of ways that you
could<00:01:37.650> make<00:01:37.920> money<00:01:38.159> off<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> everybody

anyway<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> prediction<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.150> solar

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
anyway the prediction is that solar

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
anyway the prediction is that solar
activity<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.229> fall<00:01:43.439> by<00:01:43.590> sixty<00:01:44.040> percent

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
activity will fall by sixty percent

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
activity will fall by sixty percent
between<00:01:44.729> 2030<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> 20<00:01:46.110> 40<00:01:46.409> which<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
between 2030 and 20 40 which is going to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.770 
between 2030 and 20 40 which is going to
cause<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.520> mini<00:01:47.790> ice<00:01:48.000> age<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> sixty

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
cause this mini ice age and sixty

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
cause this mini ice age and sixty
percent<00:01:48.899> sounds<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.460> about

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
percent sounds like a lot I think about

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.460 
percent sounds like a lot I think about
a<00:01:50.670> sixty<00:01:50.970> percent<00:01:51.119> drop<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.600> anything<00:01:52.140> else

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a sixty percent drop in anything else

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
a sixty percent drop in anything else
like<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.130> sandwich<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.700> sixty<00:01:53.970> percent

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like if your sandwich got sixty percent

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
like if your sandwich got sixty percent
smaller<00:01:54.360> you'd<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> pretty<00:01:55.259> hungry<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.890> if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
your bedroom about sixty percent smaller

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.459 
your bedroom about sixty percent smaller
you<00:01:57.689> wouldn't<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> enough<00:01:58.110> room<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.439> all

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
you wouldn't have enough room for all

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
you wouldn't have enough room for all
your<00:01:58.619> space<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> guy<00:02:00.000> you're<00:02:00.180> dating

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
got sixty percent of smaller when you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.620

take<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.549> clothes<00:02:02.820> off<00:02:03.000> you'd<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> pretty
