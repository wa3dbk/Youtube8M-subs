00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
think dental surgery means take out

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.010 
think dental surgery means take out
people's<00:02:43.400> gums<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.940> teeth<00:02:44.030> who<00:02:44.480> knows<00:02:44.660> but

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
yeah more x-rays there as well so it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.630 
yeah more x-rays there as well so it
could<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:48.650> tied<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.130> zombie<00:02:49.550> of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
could have tied down a zombie of
