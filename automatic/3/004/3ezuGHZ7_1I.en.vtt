00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.179
 the young 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.309
 Let's talk about the important topic today. 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.790
 much comment asked that the purchase 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.670
 or not to win but before that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.210
 I want to ask you which of these 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.820
 books or those types of diet you 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.820
 think you think you're more efficient 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:51.649
 Who answered that nobody answered him 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.649
 also correct and this too 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.940
 because everyone is correct because in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.150
 what matters is not the type of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 diet you make your Video or 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.290
 soup because what will set your 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 success is not to advance a diet and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 professional at grand 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 what will determine if success and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.890
 attitude is your motivation 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 if you can not afford a gym there is not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.020
 can pay the toll as you can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 walk 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.539
 if you do not have time to go at the moment 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.649
 To the gym the week is very 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.539
 complicated 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.149
 I do at home some crunches 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.580
 if you can already occur 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.270
 Of course, I never recommend that you ever 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.479
 it occurred 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 I ran out and there was a plan where 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.039
 You start forwarding the cuts. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.310
 made on the way the canopy 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.690
 this is the most ideal but at least what 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690
 You're going for a walk. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 if you want to lose weight and this video 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 addresses this issue specifically 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.570
 so you have to do the following 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.540
 first change your power supply and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.660
 physical exercise and motivation 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.780
 so let's talk quickly about 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.330
 basic concepts what is the loop is clear 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.630
 that here I will not define what you will 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.300
 eat what you will do your gym 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.310
 but the basics say if you wanna lose 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.110
 Weight 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.580
 So let's get those things out of your 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.010
 guidance that clearly 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.860
 nutritionist will take what you want 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.990
 the excess sugar and I 'm not saying 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.220
 not to consume sugar and fat 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.700
 it is also important 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.970
 the fries too much fat 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.820
 grease for example of turns 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.360
 the yellow cheeses now clear that the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.739
 ideal and nowadays it is very accessible 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.860
 in terms of values 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.709
 It's you in relation to food to look for 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.239
 a professional nutritionist or 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 artist 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.299
 so start no longer starts to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.090

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.769

 you are responsible for your goals 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.350
 so to excuse everything that is on the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.140
 his back or is it his job or is he 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.180
