00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
just on the crease here and I also tried

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
just on the crease here and I also tried
the<00:01:12.990> lipstick<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> check<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> color<00:01:14.340> or

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the lipstick so check on the color or

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
the lipstick so check on the color or
the<00:01:14.820> lip<00:01:15.000> gloss<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> Ecstasy

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the lip gloss but of Ecstasy

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
the lip gloss but of Ecstasy
now<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> primers<00:01:17.820> smell<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.509> funny<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.170> me

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
now the primers smell really funny to me

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
now the primers smell really funny to me
but<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.950> probably<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> doesn't

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but that was probably because it doesn't

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
but that was probably because it doesn't
have<00:01:21.090> any<00:01:21.119> perfume<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> good<00:01:22.500> thing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
have any perfume which is a good thing

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
have any perfume which is a good thing
and<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> foundation<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.580> give<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and the foundation can give a lot of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
and the foundation can give a lot of
coverage<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.930> cream<00:01:28.170> foundation<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> that's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
coverage the cream foundation but that's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
coverage the cream foundation but that's
okay<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.780> looking<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.380> caked
