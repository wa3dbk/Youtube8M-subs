now that's bad because you lose a lot of
the<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.780> know<00:02:31.810> light<00:02:32.110> because<00:02:32.410> you're<00:02:32.530> just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the you know light because you're just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.320 
the you know light because you're just
cropping<00:02:33.100> what<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.340> already<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:34.000> for

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
you find is electronic its LCD so a

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600 
you find is electronic its LCD so a
little<00:03:34.690> tiny<00:03:34.870> LCD<00:03:35.290> screen<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:36.280> here

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
little tiny LCD screen like here

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.550 
little tiny LCD screen like here
somewhere<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.660> inside<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.050> camera<00:03:38.260> and

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
somewhere in the inside the camera and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.440 
somewhere in the inside the camera and
it's<00:03:39.100> really<00:03:39.310> bad<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.670> smaller<00:03:40.060> LCD

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
it's really bad because smaller LCD

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's really bad because smaller LCD
screens<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.840> refresh<00:03:41.320> rate<00:03:41.530> problem<00:03:41.890> Q<00:03:42.010> they

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
screens have refresh rate problem Q they

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.370 
screens have refresh rate problem Q they
can't<00:03:42.340> refresh<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.850> picture<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.690> fast<00:03:44.050> and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
can't refresh the picture that fast and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.290 
can't refresh the picture that fast and
I<00:03:45.190> find<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.700> problem<00:03:45.910> when<00:03:46.090> I'm<00:03:46.180> using

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
I find that be a problem when I'm using

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.600 
I find that be a problem when I'm using
electronic<00:03:46.750> viewfinder<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.890> image<00:03:48.100> here<00:03:48.550> is

electronic viewfinder the image here is
very<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.090> know<00:03:49.120> stuttery<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.959> slow<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.560> not

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
very you know stuttery and slow and not

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.620 
very you know stuttery and slow and not
it's<00:03:51.220> not<00:03:51.340> smooth<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.910> fluid<00:03:52.180> like<00:03:52.300> would<00:03:52.480> be

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
it's not smooth and fluid like would be

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.320 
it's not smooth and fluid like would be
on<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> LCD<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.530> bigger<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:54.090> now<00:03:55.090> with<00:03:55.239> that

on the LCD the bigger one now with that

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.259 
on the LCD the bigger one now with that
being<00:03:55.480> said<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.840> does<00:03:55.989> except<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.769> bottom

being said it does except on the bottom

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.870 
being said it does except on the bottom
there's<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.300> battery<00:03:58.480> compartment<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.880> SD

there's a battery compartment and SD

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.360 
there's a battery compartment and SD
card<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.540> accepts<00:04:02.080> SDHC<00:04:02.739> which<00:04:02.950> means<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.280> can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
card it accepts SDHC which means it can

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.449 
card it accepts SDHC which means it can
go<00:04:03.519> up<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.640> 60<00:04:04.620> 32<00:04:05.620> gigabyte<00:04:06.040> something<00:04:06.340> at

viewfinder it's right there and it's
really<00:04:22.810> nice<00:04:23.020> because<00:04:23.260> when<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.470> use<00:04:23.590> flash

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
really nice because when you use flash

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.480 
really nice because when you use flash
you<00:04:24.700> can<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.960> can<00:04:26.190> mandate<00:04:27.190> that

well what thing and you'd have to use an

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.680 
well what thing and you'd have to use an
electronic<00:04:36.130> settings<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.729> get<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:37.060> it's

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
electronic settings to get that it's

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.909 
electronic settings to get that it's
really<00:04:37.870> easy<00:04:38.229> because<00:04:38.440> when<00:04:38.710> you're<00:04:38.800> using

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
really easy because when you're using

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
like trying to settings that you know I

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.300 
like trying to settings that you know I
want<00:04:40.660> go<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.110> flash<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.650> turn<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.889> on<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.160> off

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.529 
want go to flash and turn it on and off
it<00:04:42.849> takes<00:04:43.000> time

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
it takes time

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.570 
it takes time
this<00:04:43.840> one<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.139> just<00:04:44.169> takes<00:04:44.410> press<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.550> button

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
this one it just takes press of a button

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.540 
this one it just takes press of a button
and<00:04:45.970> pushing<00:04:46.569> it<00:04:46.660> down<00:04:47.130> what's<00:04:48.130> really<00:04:48.400> nice

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
and pushing it down what's really nice

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.730 
and pushing it down what's really nice
about<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.819> cameras<00:04:49.210> also<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.660> has<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.990> auto

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
about this cameras also that has a auto

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.129 
about this cameras also that has a auto
focus<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.460> lock<00:04:51.759> so<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.449> can<00:04:52.630> focus<00:04:52.840> between

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
focus like lock so you can focus between

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.529 
focus like lock so you can focus between
um<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.949> choose<00:04:54.280> your<00:04:54.430> focus<00:04:54.729> manually<00:04:55.360> I

um you can choose your focus manually I

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.020 
um you can choose your focus manually I
mean<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.380> mean<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.710> can<00:04:56.830> sorry<00:04:57.669> that's<00:04:57.880> wrong

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
mean I mean you can sorry that's wrong

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.149 
mean I mean you can sorry that's wrong
you<00:04:58.449> can<00:04:58.599> choose<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:59.020> can<00:04:59.110> focus<00:04:59.680> things<00:04:59.889> and

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
you can choose you can focus things and

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.339 
you can choose you can focus things and
lock<00:05:00.759> onto<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.300> focus<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.870> when<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.169> go<00:05:02.289> to

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
lock onto that focus so when you go to

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.350 
lock onto that focus so when you go to
move<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.919> different<00:05:02.949> area<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:04.180> can

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
move it to a different area you can

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259 
obsessive than compact camera which is

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.290 
obsessive than compact camera which is
we<00:06:23.500> should<00:06:23.650> really<00:06:23.860> go<00:06:23.979> for<00:06:24.130> about<00:06:24.250> 200<00:06:24.699> but<00:06:25.180> it

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
we should really go for about 200 but it

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.089
