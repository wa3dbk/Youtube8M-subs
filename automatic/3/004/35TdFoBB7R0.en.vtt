out versus the originals from 93 so
we'll<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> look<00:00:14.120> my<00:00:15.120> 93<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.049> had<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
we'll have a look my 93 is I had to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.689 
we'll have a look my 93 is I had to
shrink-wrap<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.010> originals<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.520> had<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
shrink-wrap the originals I had to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.510 
shrink-wrap the originals I had to
shrink-wrap<00:00:18.119> because<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.800> they're<00:00:20.250> starting

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
shrink-wrap because the they're starting

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
shrink-wrap because the they're starting
to<00:00:20.580> fall<00:00:20.730> apart<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.390> honestly<00:00:22.260> they're<00:00:22.439> in

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to fall apart and honestly they're in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.080 
to fall apart and honestly they're in
pretty<00:00:22.710> bad<00:00:22.859> condition<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.490> dead<00:00:23.789> stock

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pretty bad condition they are dead stock

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
pretty bad condition they are dead stock
but<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> had<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> shrink<00:00:26.070> wrap

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but as you can see I had to shrink wrap

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
but as you can see I had to shrink wrap
them<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> keep<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.970> intact<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.599> we'll

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
them just to keep them intact so we'll

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
them just to keep them intact so we'll
go<00:00:28.590> ahead<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> take<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> look<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.349> so

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
whereas on the originals I'm not sure

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and it's hard to see because they're

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.690

color<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:55.049> new<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.549> new<00:01:56.670> pair<00:01:56.939> appear

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
color the new one of the new pair appear

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.859 
color the new one of the new pair appear
to<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.170> green<00:01:58.500> than<00:01:59.189> blue<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.630> think

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to be more green than blue and I think

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.179 
to be more green than blue and I think
that<00:02:01.020> shot<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.469> should<00:02:01.920> kind<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that shot right there should kind of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.990 
that shot right there should kind of
show<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.399> difference<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.820> has

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
show that difference but that that has

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.290 
show that difference but that that has
more<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.479> green<00:02:07.409> finish<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.300> whereas

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
more of a green finish to it whereas

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.309 
more of a green finish to it whereas
this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> definitely<00:02:10.190> definitely<00:02:11.190> more<00:02:11.580> blue

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.850 

third<00:02:14.709> thing<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.730> mesh<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.269> them<00:02:16.860> right

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
third thing the the mesh on them right

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.399 
third thing the the mesh on them right
by<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.099> Nike<00:02:18.459> swoosh<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.019> see<00:02:20.170> right

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
by the Nike swoosh as you can see right

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.149 
by the Nike swoosh as you can see right
here<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.120> has<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.299> different<00:02:22.390> look<00:02:23.159> than

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
here it just has a different look than

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.759 
here it just has a different look than
this<00:02:24.489> mesh<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.480> also<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> new

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
this mesh right here and also on the new

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.100 
this mesh right here and also on the new
version<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.819> some<00:02:28.450> sort<00:02:28.689> of<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.959> can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
version there is some sort of you can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.100 
version there is some sort of you can
see<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.379> border<00:02:29.829> around<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:31.390> leather<00:02:31.599> part

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.449 

so<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.319> is<00:02:35.530> another<00:02:35.860> difference<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:38.459> have

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
so that is another difference I have

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.039 
so that is another difference I have
heard<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.819> lot<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:40.120> people<00:02:40.359> talking<00:02:40.629> about<00:02:40.870> how

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
heard a lot of people talking about how

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.440 
heard a lot of people talking about how
the<00:02:41.290> airbags<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.250> gotten<00:02:42.579> smaller<00:02:42.909> over<00:02:43.329> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
the airbags have gotten smaller over the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.110 
the airbags have gotten smaller over the
years<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.079> so<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.799> actually<00:02:45.010> did<00:02:45.519> measure<00:02:45.790> them

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
years and so I actually did measure them

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.270 
years and so I actually did measure them
and<00:02:46.359> I'll<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:47.409> on<00:02:47.560> camera<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.250> but

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
and I'll do that on camera here but

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.289 
and I'll do that on camera here but
basically<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.950> original<00:02:51.519> pairs<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
basically on the original pairs it's the

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.470 
basically on the original pairs it's the
airbag<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.750> about<00:02:52.959> two<00:02:53.290> centimeters<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:55.000> on

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
airbag is about two centimeters and on

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.059 
airbag is about two centimeters and on
the<00:02:55.659> new<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:56.049> it's<00:02:56.200> only<00:02:56.319> about<00:02:56.500> one<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
the new one it's only about one and a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.259 
the new one it's only about one and a
half<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.150> I'll<00:02:58.510> I'll<00:02:58.930> show<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.440> here

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.809 

see<00:03:04.269> that's<00:03:04.450> almost<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:08.400> where<00:03:09.400> as<00:03:09.609> this

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
see that's almost to where as this

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.330 
see that's almost to where as this
version<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:12.220> one<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.970> three<00:03:13.000> quarters

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
version is about one in three quarters

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.649 
version is about one in three quarters
so<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.670> little<00:03:15.879> bit<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> change<00:03:16.420> there

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
so just a little bit of a change there

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.000 
so just a little bit of a change there
but<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.049> noticeable<00:03:19.319> one<00:03:20.319> more<00:03:20.500> thing<00:03:20.769> that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
but it is noticeable one more thing that

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.069 
but it is noticeable one more thing that
I<00:03:21.579> was<00:03:22.030> really<00:03:22.209> kind<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.540> hoping<00:03:22.599> for<00:03:22.840> around

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
I was really kind of hoping for around

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.530 
I was really kind of hoping for around
the<00:03:23.349> pictures<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.859> looked<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:25.329> little

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the pictures it looked like this little

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
the pictures it looked like this little
foot<00:03:25.810> hole<00:03:25.989> was<00:03:26.169> sewn<00:03:26.410> into<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.889> leather<00:03:27.069> and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
foot hole was sewn into the leather and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.189 
foot hole was sewn into the leather and
it<00:03:27.459> actually<00:03:27.639> is<00:03:28.030> there's<00:03:28.299> no<00:03:28.480> there's<00:03:29.139> no

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
it actually is there's no there's no

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.869 
it actually is there's no there's no
separation<00:03:29.739> between<00:03:29.859> these<00:03:30.280> two<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.549> that's

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
separation between these two that that's

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.789 
separation between these two that that's
sewn<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.329> on<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.900> original<00:03:32.319> pair<00:03:32.500> there<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
sewn on on the original pair there is

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.479 
sewn on on the original pair there is
separation<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:34.000> I'll<00:03:34.299> bring<00:03:34.840> back<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.489> pair

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
separation and I'll bring back this pair

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.220 
separation and I'll bring back this pair
of<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:37.060> flame<00:03:37.299> Reds<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.810> show<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.019> what<00:03:38.199> I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
of the the flame Reds to show you what I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.039 
of the the flame Reds to show you what I
mean<00:03:38.410> this<00:03:39.129> is<00:03:39.629> completely<00:03:40.629> not<00:03:41.560> sewn<00:03:41.919> into

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
mean this is completely not sewn into

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.809 
mean this is completely not sewn into
the<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.319> lace<00:03:44.500> whole<00:03:44.769> flap<00:03:45.069> right<00:03:45.310> here<00:03:45.340> so

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
the the lace whole flap right here so

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.420 
the the lace whole flap right here so
that's<00:03:46.419> a<00:03:46.690> big<00:03:47.319> difference<00:03:47.470> from<00:03:47.769> from<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
that's a big difference from from the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.129 
that's a big difference from from the
original<00:03:51.030> while<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.180> while<00:03:52.540> we're<00:03:52.750> looking<00:03:53.049> at

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
original while we while we're looking at

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.319 
original while we while we're looking at
the<00:03:53.230> tons<00:03:53.500> did<00:03:54.340> notice<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.699> quick<00:03:54.970> difference

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
the tons did notice a quick difference

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.170 
the tons did notice a quick difference
in<00:03:55.449> color<00:03:56.190> as<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:58.090> can<00:03:58.209> see<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:59.970> tongue<00:04:00.970> on

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
in color as you can see the tongue on

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.509 
in color as you can see the tongue on
the<00:04:01.269> new<00:04:01.389> one<00:04:01.599> has<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:03.519> green<00:04:03.940> color<00:04:04.269> in<00:04:04.629> air

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the new one has that green color in air

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.599 
the new one has that green color in air
whereas<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.699> original<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.449> just<00:04:07.659> white<00:04:07.840> and

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
whereas the original it's just white and

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.430 
whereas the original it's just white and
I<00:04:09.609> noticed<00:04:10.060> one<00:04:10.449> more<00:04:10.629> color<00:04:10.870> difference<00:04:11.319> on

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
I noticed one more color difference on

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.629 
I noticed one more color difference on
the<00:04:11.560> sole<00:04:12.780> where<00:04:14.970> it's<00:04:15.970> kind<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.329> inverted<00:04:17.639> as

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
the sole where it's kind of inverted as

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.290 
the sole where it's kind of inverted as
you<00:04:18.849> can<00:04:19.000> see<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.829> original<00:04:21.310> sole<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:22.090> air

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
you can see on the original sole the air
