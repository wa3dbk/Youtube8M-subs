 minecraft 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.969
 no 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.820
 I have three worlds and in this world of the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 exhibitions ii x3 this is the first one 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.240
 villa 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:03.040
 and very simple from here thanks goes to 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.040
 My own room yellow 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:15.759
 now let's move on to the second is what it is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.759
 a cinema 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:29.660
 with the ticket office here the rooms for the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.240
 film bar and how much only truth is that 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.460
 your identical as exactly on the other 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.460
 part that now what can 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.090
 perfect 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.060
 society on the other side but not yes 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.910
 can show again 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.080
 now let's pass this all traps that 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.080
 I will show you this video 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.480
 now let's move on to the last thing of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:10.460
 this world that should because it is here 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.630
 here that this is the yacht I have 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.570
 already seen in the last video and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.530
 so I don't even know other cinemas maybe 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:27.850
 no from villain or we leave the world 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.850
 let's go to this one 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.060
 and here you are three wrong but fourth names 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.120
 maybe I don't know if I'll show you that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.120
 it's not that it's very beautiful 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.100
 then it may be the first that was one 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.030
 house species villa no 4 safe as 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.940
 to shut down and enter in to Propiano 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.730
 here I leave you the most things 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.250
 part of the times empty for a study 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.070
 the plant and then from the second that the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.320
 choice from here to door if you want to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.050
 third there is an internal staircase that there 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.050
 bring another floor that is smaller 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:26.770
 now let's move on to the second which is this 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.900
 here that boljare in the first video is also 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.230
 what I just did you see or 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.270
 the first floor is everything as you see 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.040
 previously I do not take off i 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.250
 cases because I don't like the species 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.340
 building the stairs here is the same 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:48.790
 first floor smaller than here too 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.360
 to an equal and now I'll show you in 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.350
 3 2 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.350
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.230
 then then there's this here that isn't there 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.730
 this video is a huge slides then 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.760
 this is what there is no doubt how 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.160
 I did it show it but you didn't 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.830
 I show it has then there is the pro r 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.640
 loco showed the castle there 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:19.540
 I really want to see this already 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:25.450
 made to see that the villa that alone is 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:28.780
 the biggest as I can this of the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.740
 all empty as usual you are what 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.950
 here and here but then they are like that and two others 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.950
 rooms 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.320
 now let's move on to the last advice in 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:51.780
 this world and then in the other world e 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.540
 let's do 12 then it must be 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.740
 language that of this when perhaps the most 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.290
 beautiful and functional what what here and 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.540
 I've really put it very much 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:09.050
 and build it is a huge thing 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.889
 especially if glass columns ie 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.530
 heat from the inside 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.150
 so what did he show us? 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.150
 they are offensive rooms 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:28.470
 so then there is a single huge floor it is 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.180
 false on the plans that nausea should and e 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:38.460
 let's turn this real trouble with 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.840
 floor made of leaf ok now 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.840
 let's move on to another world 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.080
 which is this here 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.660
 and this is the last construction I have 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.230
 I spent eight hours the other day 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.360
 I think the ball is the construction 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.920
 more beautiful than I have come 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.200
 and here it is a pirate ship if 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.420
 we say or do better but that 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.260
 call as we want then I do 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.910
 see up close 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.950
 then there is inside 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.550
 as I said understand support it 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.030
 this one will decorate it here and then here 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.440
 under 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.910
 there are also two floors because otherwise 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.000
 waste we would be the part below 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.670
 of the ship that is paved 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.140
 so I decided to do two more floors 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:44.230
 that these I don't know if they talk about it 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:46.210
 I'm really, really big now 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.410
 let's move on to the other rooms it is 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.410
 exactly the same 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.979
 and then you are wondering why they are there 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:02.919
 these were the goals I immediately had 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:06.690
 I send you let this lever complete 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.690
 exactly that one 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.060
 come out of the bureau the two scales 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.280
 same thing is done here however done 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:21.360
 when he will give god and then here then there is this 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.599
 sailing that from where it came too well 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.599
 and then 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.980
 this part the exact same thing 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.560
 It follows the highest 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:47.900
 and then I also did the scale here 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:54.860
 if someone wanted to commit suicide 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:58.350
 on this ship like this and then you throw it 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.009
 however this is the second I came 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.759
 me very, very well and with this 

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:07.229
 construction 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:09.060
 I finish my video here and if there is 

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:12.979
 liked put a I like I left 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.979
 goodbye comment
