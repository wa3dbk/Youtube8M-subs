00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
one as a Christmas gift and I actually

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.270 
one as a Christmas gift and I actually
did<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.750> organizer<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.920> isn't

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
did it like the organizer so this isn't

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.869 
did it like the organizer so this isn't
really<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.640> organizer<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> same

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
really an organizer but it's in the same

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
really an organizer but it's in the same
concept<00:00:38.930> only<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> filled<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.710> pictures

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
concept only I filled it with pictures

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.310 
concept only I filled it with pictures
so<00:00:41.550> anyway<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> thought<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.050> would<00:00:43.170> be

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so anyway I thought it would be

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
so anyway I thought it would be
something<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.770> something<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
something different something that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.350 
something different something that
nobody<00:00:44.910> else<00:00:44.969> had<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.920> anyway<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> cover<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
nobody else had so anyway on the cover I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
nobody else had so anyway on the cover I
kept<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.840> simple<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.620> wanted<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
kept it really simple I just wanted it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.639 
kept it really simple I just wanted it
to<00:00:50.100> look<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.430> book<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.020> did<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> border

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
thought this was really cute I didn't

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
thought this was really cute I didn't
put<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> tag<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.360> guy<00:01:46.110> looks<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
put a tag and this guy looks like a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
put a tag and this guy looks like a
monster<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.250> whatever<00:01:47.460> he<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.850> eating

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
monster with whatever he was eating

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
monster with whatever he was eating
there<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:50.299> anyway<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.570> didn't<00:01:52.320> put<00:01:52.439> tag<00:01:52.680> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
there and anyway I didn't put tag on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
there and anyway I didn't put tag on
this<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.430> thought<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.790> she<00:01:54.360> could

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this because I thought that she could

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.440 
this because I thought that she could
slip<00:01:54.979> some<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.189> photos<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> maybe<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
slip some other photos and maybe that I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.679 
slip some other photos and maybe that I
don't<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.729> tags<00:02:00.119> she<00:02:00.540> could

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
don't have that are on tags she could

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
don't have that are on tags she could
just<00:02:00.869> slip<00:02:01.049> some<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.530> there<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
just slip some in there and then the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
just slip some in there and then the
back<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:05.030> made<00:02:06.030> our<00:02:06.149> tag<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.290> journal

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and then and that just slips right

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.770
