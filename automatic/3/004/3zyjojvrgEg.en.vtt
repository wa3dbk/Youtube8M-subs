00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
distance test to see which headset has a

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.530 
distance test to see which headset has a
longer<00:00:38.920> Bluetooth<00:00:39.460> range<00:00:39.699> this<00:00:40.150> is<00:00:40.299> just<00:00:40.449> a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
longer Bluetooth range this is just a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.660 
longer Bluetooth range this is just a

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
signal I'm gonna put the original seven

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.820 
signal I'm gonna put the original seven
hundreds<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.629> first<00:00:46.960> walk<00:00:47.290> as<00:00:47.440> far<00:00:47.559> as<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.769> can

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.890 
hundreds on first walk as far as I can
until<00:00:48.220> I<00:00:48.250> lose<00:00:48.489> signal<00:00:48.729> and<00:00:49.089> then<00:00:49.449> do<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.720> same

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
distance how far away it is so I walked

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.660 
distance how far away it is so I walked
backwards<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.739> seven<00:01:00.010> 30s<00:01:00.339> you<00:01:00.430> see<00:01:00.580> on

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
39 feet away is where the 702 made it so

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.120 
39 feet away is where the 702 made it so

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
sure why the 700s did so much better

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.330 
sure why the 700s did so much better
than<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.300> 7<00:04:10.600> 30s<00:04:10.930> out<00:04:11.020> in<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> field<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:12.220> in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
than the 7 30s out in the field but in

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.240 
than the 7 30s out in the field but in
the<00:04:12.370> house<00:04:12.640> they<00:04:13.180> were<00:04:13.209> basically<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> same

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
the house they were basically the same

the house they were basically the same
my<00:04:15.250> final<00:04:15.580> advice<00:04:15.820> would<00:04:16.000> be<00:04:16.060> if<00:04:16.180> you're

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
my final advice would be if you're

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.020 
my final advice would be if you're
concerned<00:04:16.540> about<00:04:16.630> range<00:04:17.019> get<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.980> HBS<00:04:18.459> 700

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
concerned about range get the HBS 700

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.280 
concerned about range get the HBS 700
tones<00:04:19.209> they<00:04:19.450> do<00:04:19.510> just<00:04:19.750> have<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> little<00:04:20.109> bit

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
tones they do just have a little bit

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.200 
tones they do just have a little bit
better<00:04:20.470> range<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.190> if<00:04:21.640> you<00:04:21.730> want<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.970> little

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
better range and if you want a little

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.240 
better range and if you want a little
bit<00:04:22.300> better<00:04:22.510> sound<00:04:22.840> quality<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.919> really

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250
