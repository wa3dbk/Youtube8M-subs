think pretty much their ID on this is a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.660 
think pretty much their ID on this is a
it<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> gives<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.680> suit<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> nice<00:01:38.340> look

made<00:02:16.620> by<00:02:16.770> band<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.959> actually<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.050> kind<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> like

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
made by band a actually is kind of like

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.020 
made by band a actually is kind of like
a<00:02:19.440> ball<00:02:19.680> jointed<00:02:20.010> hip<00:02:20.250> now<00:02:20.580> these<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.910> also

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
a ball jointed hip now these can also

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.900 
a ball jointed hip now these can also
pull<00:02:21.330> away<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> body<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.819> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
pull away from the body like so so you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640 
pull away from the body like so so you
can<00:02:24.060> actually<00:02:24.180> get<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.629> like<00:02:24.900> quite<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.410> range

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
can actually get have like quite a range

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.580 
can actually get have like quite a range
of<00:02:25.770> motion<00:02:26.069> on<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.190> actual<00:02:26.459> leg<00:02:27.020> as<00:02:28.020> well<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of motion on the actual leg as well to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
of motion on the actual leg as well to
the<00:02:28.680> side<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.209> then<00:02:30.209> he<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the side and then he just kind of you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.479 
the side and then he just kind of you
know<00:02:30.870> move<00:02:31.080> back<00:02:31.260> into<00:02:31.440> place<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.950> it's

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
know move back into place so it's

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.860 
know move back into place so it's
essentially<00:02:32.849> kind<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.360> sort<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
essentially kind of like sort of a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.920 
essentially kind of like sort of a
double<00:02:34.200> ball<00:02:34.379> joint<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> these

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
double ball joint so I really like these

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.509 
double ball joint so I really like these
because<00:02:37.080> they<00:02:37.260> give<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.920> huge<00:02:38.099> range<00:02:38.430> of

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
because they give a really huge range of

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.580 
because they give a really huge range of
motion<00:02:38.879> he's<00:02:39.660> got<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> ball<00:02:40.140> joint<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
motion he's got a ball joint on the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
motion he's got a ball joint on the
abdomen<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:42.680> sorry<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.739> waist<00:02:44.010> baldwin<00:02:44.879> in

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
abdomen or sorry the waist baldwin in

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.180 
abdomen or sorry the waist baldwin in
the<00:02:45.150> middle<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.450> abdomen<00:02:46.010> he's<00:02:47.010> got

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the middle of the abdomen he's got

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.440 
the middle of the abdomen he's got
double<00:02:47.489> ball<00:02:47.670> jointed<00:02:47.970> neck<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.390> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
double ball jointed neck where it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.229 
double ball jointed neck where it
connects<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.959> body<00:02:49.140> as<00:02:49.319> well<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> head

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
connects to the body as well as the head

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.880 
connects to the body as well as the head
so<00:02:51.239> he<00:02:51.390> can't<00:02:51.629> look<00:02:51.840> down<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.410> well<00:02:52.590> kind<00:02:52.860> of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
so he can't look down that well kind of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.920 
so he can't look down that well kind of
unless<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.280> use<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.610> torso<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.390> abdomen

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
unless you use the torso for the abdomen

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.229 
unless you use the torso for the abdomen
joint<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.319> well<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:55.980> he<00:02:56.129> can<00:02:56.310> look<00:02:56.459> up<00:02:56.670> very

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
joint as well but he can look up very

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.750 
joint as well but he can look up very
well<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.890> then<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.159> can<00:02:59.370> tip<00:02:59.519> his<00:02:59.640> head

like so similar if you saw my spider-man
review<00:03:21.349> it's<00:03:22.349> not<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.620> huge<00:03:22.950> grape<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.519> a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
review it's not a huge grape it's a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.050 
review it's not a huge grape it's a
little<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.209> annoying<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.129> possibly<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
little bit annoying the the possibly the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.280 
little bit annoying the the possibly the
whole<00:03:27.239> should<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.810> deeper<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
whole should be a little deeper the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.229 
whole should be a little deeper the
balls<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.650> little<00:03:28.739> bigger<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:29.970> prevent

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
balls a little bigger just to prevent

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.520 
balls a little bigger just to prevent
that<00:03:30.450> from<00:03:30.510> happening<00:03:30.659> but<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.200> would<00:03:31.379> rather

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that from happening but I would rather

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140 
that from happening but I would rather
have<00:03:31.799> them<00:03:31.920> pop<00:03:32.129> out<00:03:32.310> than<00:03:32.519> them<00:03:32.640> snap<00:03:32.909> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
have them pop out than them snap and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.320 
have them pop out than them snap and
brick<00:03:33.360> right<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.409> really<00:03:34.620> not<00:03:34.799> all<00:03:34.860> that

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
brick right so it's really not all that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.190 
brick right so it's really not all that
you<00:03:36.330> know<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.510> doesn't<00:03:36.629> really<00:03:36.870> bother<00:03:37.049> me

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
you know it doesn't really bother me

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.430 
you know it doesn't really bother me

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
swivel where the ball joint is there

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.100 
swivel where the ball joint is there
like<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.519> he's<00:03:44.519> got<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> doe<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.599> think<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.049> a
