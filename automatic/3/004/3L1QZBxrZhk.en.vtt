call<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> napalm<00:02:03.259> even<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
call it a napalm even if you have to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.639 
call it a napalm even if you have to
wait<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> while<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.479> people

when they get their killstreak napalm
especially<00:02:09.750> rc-xd<00:02:10.110> they'll<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.590> stop<00:02:10.890> in

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
especially rc-xd they'll just stop in

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.830 
especially rc-xd they'll just stop in
the<00:02:11.190> middle<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.489> open<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.879> just

altec killstreak it's like first of all
get<00:02:14.640> into<00:02:14.760> cover<00:02:15.000> second<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> all<00:02:15.739> wait<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.920> use

get into cover second of all wait to use

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.070 
get into cover second of all wait to use
it<00:02:17.220> until<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.940> actually<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.390> UAV<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.959> the

it until you actually have a UAV in the
air<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.620> napalm<00:02:20.040> strike<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> that's

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
air for like napalm strike so that's

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.570 
air for like napalm strike so that's
what<00:02:21.720> i'm<00:02:21.810> doing<00:02:22.019> here<00:02:22.200> waiting<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> UAV

what i'm doing here waiting for the UAV

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.770 
what i'm doing here waiting for the UAV

you can turn your napalm into it one of
the<00:02:44.280> most<00:02:44.310> overpowered<00:02:44.910> kill<00:02:45.090> streaks<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the most overpowered kill streaks in the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.050 
the most overpowered kill streaks in the
game<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.840> my<00:02:45.959> opinion<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.560> mean<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> lot<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.790> times

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
game in my opinion I mean a lot of times

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.370 
game in my opinion I mean a lot of times
you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.209> call<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.510> dogs<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.870> only<00:02:49.049> get<00:02:49.170> two<00:02:49.290> or

of kills but basically right here I drop
it<00:02:54.750> sort<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.049> right<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.470> Valley<00:02:55.739> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
it sort of right in that Valley you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.410 
it sort of right in that Valley you
don't<00:02:56.310> want<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.489> drop<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.700> sideways<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
don't want to drop it sideways you

don't want to drop it sideways you
always<00:02:57.660> want<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> drop<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.129> direction

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
always want to drop it in the direction

always want to drop it in the direction
the<00:02:59.579> people<00:02:59.819> are<00:02:59.910> running<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.540> want<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> drop

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the people are running you want to drop

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.009 
the people are running you want to drop
it<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.079> straight<00:03:01.410> line<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.739> top<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.069> them<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
it on a straight line on top of them and

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.940 
it on a straight line on top of them and
the<00:03:04.019> first<00:03:04.230> thing<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.440> need<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.739> when

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the first thing you need to do when

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.039 
the first thing you need to do when
you're<00:03:05.069> visualizing<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.610> napalm<00:03:05.910> strike<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
you're visualizing your napalm strike is

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.479 
you're visualizing your napalm strike is
don't<00:03:07.349> even<00:03:07.530> look<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.890> reticule<00:03:08.280> they

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
don't even look at that reticule they

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.220 
don't even look at that reticule they
give<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.000> mean<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.660> thing<00:03:09.720> does<00:03:10.079> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
give you I mean that thing does it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.589 
give you I mean that thing does it
doesn't<00:03:11.099> mean<00:03:11.340> anything<00:03:11.370> basically<00:03:11.970> envision

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
doesn't mean anything basically envision

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.979 
doesn't mean anything basically envision
if<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:14.010> will<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> Rolling<00:03:14.730> Thunder<00:03:14.989> icon

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
if you will the Rolling Thunder icon

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.099 
if you will the Rolling Thunder icon
that<00:03:16.709> sort<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.040> long<00:03:17.280> narrow<00:03:17.819> line<00:03:18.120> that's<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
that sort of long narrow line that's a

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.170 
that sort of long narrow line that's a
lot<00:03:19.350> more<00:03:19.620> accurate<00:03:20.340> representation<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.120> what

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
lot more accurate representation of what

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.360 
lot more accurate representation of what
the<00:03:21.389> napalm<00:03:21.780> strike<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.470> does<00:03:22.650> it's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the napalm strike actually does it's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.000 
the napalm strike actually does it's
about<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.079> lot<00:03:25.260> longer<00:03:25.620> I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
about that with but it's a lot longer I

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.770 
about that with but it's a lot longer I
mean<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.370> thing<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.760> almost<00:03:26.970> cut<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
mean that thing can almost cut the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.990 
mean that thing can almost cut the
entire<00:03:28.079> length<00:03:28.290> across<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.829> map<00:03:29.099> so<00:03:29.849> what<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
entire length across the map so what you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.039 
entire length across the map so what you
want<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> do<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.420> want<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.599> make<00:03:30.720> sure<00:03:30.750> that

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
want to do is you want to make sure that

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.229 
want to do is you want to make sure that
dead<00:03:31.230> center<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.739> reticule<00:03:32.099> which<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.120> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
on sideways so they can't get there

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.809 
on sideways so they can't get there
it'll<00:04:04.590> definitely<00:04:04.889> cut<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.340> off<00:04:05.459> for<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.700> good

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
it'll definitely cut it off for a good

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.059 
it'll definitely cut it off for a good
five<00:04:06.060> or<00:04:06.120> ten<00:04:06.389> seconds<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.500> right<00:04:07.620> here<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.799> drop

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
five or ten seconds so right here I drop

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.190 
five or ten seconds so right here I drop
it<00:04:08.220> right<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.639> that<00:04:08.760> Canyon<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.900> usually

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
it right in that Canyon and I usually

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.069 
it right in that Canyon and I usually
take<00:04:10.470> my<00:04:10.650> time<00:04:10.859> with<00:04:10.919> my<00:04:11.160> napalm<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.810> it

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
take my time with my napalm but it

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.990 
take my time with my napalm but it
regularly<00:04:13.680> pays<00:04:13.950> off<00:04:14.160> for<00:04:14.190> me<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:14.849> right

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
regularly pays off for me it's right

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.560 
regularly pays off for me it's right
here<00:04:15.260> drop<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.289> thing<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.799> there<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.389> pick

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
here drop that thing in there and I pick

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.069 
here drop that thing in there and I pick
up<00:04:18.660> another<00:04:18.840> triple<00:04:19.229> right<00:04:19.380> there

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
up another triple right there

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.350 
up another triple right there
so<00:04:20.799> napalm<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.489> definitely<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> great

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
so napalm is definitely a great

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.820 
so napalm is definitely a great
killstreak<00:04:22.900> especially<00:04:23.349> being<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.590> it's

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
killstreak especially being that it's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.980 
killstreak especially being that it's
only<00:04:24.039> five<00:04:24.970> kills<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.539> if<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.659> have<00:04:25.750> hard

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
only five kills and if you have hard

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.929 
only five kills and if you have hard
line<00:04:26.139> on<00:04:26.169> that's<00:04:26.470> four<00:04:26.680> kills<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:27.819> can

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:27.939 
line on that's four kills so you can

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.820 
line on that's four kills so you can
have<00:04:28.000> 24<00:04:28.300> kills<00:04:28.569> and<00:04:28.870> then<00:04:29.229> a<00:04:29.259> lot<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.650> times

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
have 24 kills and then a lot of times

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.159 
have 24 kills and then a lot of times
you'll<00:04:29.979> get<00:04:30.069> double<00:04:30.310> or<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> triple<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.080> then

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
you'll get double or a triple and then

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.839 
you'll get double or a triple and then
usually<00:04:32.439> five<00:04:32.650> seconds<00:04:33.069> later<00:04:33.219> some<00:04:33.580> dumb

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849
