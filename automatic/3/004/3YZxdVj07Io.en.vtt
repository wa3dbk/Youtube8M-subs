00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.549
 [Music] 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.570
 hello youtube friends today I will bring 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.820
 a physics experiment is a replica 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.460
 of a basic principle of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 operation of a heat engine 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 this thermal engine of course the one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.370
 is here but the beginning of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.370
 operation belongs to grand jury 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.020
 kuri 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.250
 together with his wife had discovered 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.250
 radio too 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.980
 good this simple engine only 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.220
 we need 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.170
 a bit of copper wire in this 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.430
 case because you do not have to be attracted by 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 a magnet 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.810
 At the tip we will place a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.990
 small breath of something that is attracted 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.780
 for a magnet I press a pin 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.240
 made a little addict the smallest thing 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.119
 possible 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.510
 and we will also use images myself 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.060
 in this case I have neodymium here 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.000
 processes so sought after and good I have 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.070
 pretty punished already I have it put in 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.950
 a support 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.900
 I'm going to add the camera so that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.229
 can see how this works 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.229
 engine 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.440
 here you can see the wire in the field 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.290
 coppermade 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.930
 with the small wire arito 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.410
 which is attracted by the magnet placed here in 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.410
 tip 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.640
 we hang it here from a screw of a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.640
 clavito 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.990
 that turn free 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.350
 and then we are going to put a support 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.990
 to produce a warm up here in 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.440
 this area that we are only going to do with 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.880
 an ability before continuing I'll 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.680
 make a greeting to those who have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.990
 commented first on previous videos 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.500
 is for 87 then that from Spain and Caesar 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.560
 ua sharon I do not have where it is from but for 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.300
 they will be a special greeting from 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.300
 angelito and my own channel 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.840
 and now we will proceed to heat the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.840
 addict wire 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.560
 good and you will want to know why 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.560
 produces this effect 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.190
 and the materials that are attracted by 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.459
 the magnets like the case of the little tip 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.520
 of the wire 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.639
 of wire 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.060
 only attracted while we reach 700 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.990
 degrees centigrade of temperature to that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.650
 at that temperature that turns red and in 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.050
 that precise moment they stop being 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.389
 attracted by the magnet is transformed as 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.760
 if it were a piece of charcoal 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.570
 etcetera is not attracted 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.320
 then the image releases it 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.020
 [Music] 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.650
 but he has just retired the flames better 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.200
 that 100 degrees instead of 700 in 600 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.810
 barely comes out of the flame and has already 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.260
 brought back again warms the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.200
 knocks and lets go again and turns to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.820
 cool and it attracts it again it 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.810
 it heats the loose and so the cycle continues 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.790
 permanently 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.720
 hello friends this 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.860
 simple experiment that I found giving 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.800
 rounds through the network 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.280
 explain and it works as it is 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.150
 I 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.150
 and all thanks 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.280
 and who was the one who discovered 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.380
 at the beginning the engine 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.690
 of course it has many other 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.260
 applications that I 'm going to see 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.120
 What can I do with this 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.730
 to see if there may be some other 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.870
 utility no longer just showing but 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.040
 some use for 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.980
 even if it's some toy or 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.969
 and friends 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:58.389
 I want to remind you also that i 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.050
 to youtube the youngest in the network with 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.090
 only 4 years 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.370
 here you can see your channel that was 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.690
 oriented towards children and giving a 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.690
 hand with your subscription 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.300
 and you this has been all for this video 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.270
 remember that 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.270
 when finding many videos of all 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.190
 types of experiments and homemade inventions 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.990
 and all those things that are giving 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.780
 return online 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.780
 friends will be until we see each other
