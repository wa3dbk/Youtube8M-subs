00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 and the jump n is actually her 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009

 and see you soon on the map 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.780
 Halli Hello there we are already on 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.670
 a card which I consider very funny 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.620
 find that is the homepage maybe 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.360
 some of you know about it here, too 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 round with it is that I still knew 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.630
 Not at all we are here on the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.640
 new card a few days ago 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.200
 slash weeks slash when 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.270
 you also watch the video months 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.620
 came out and I already have an arrow and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 I usually find that on the bow 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.830
 card here is never a box down there 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.420
 one changes calm I will be then 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.640
 just before the countdown, hopefully 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.050
 can grab and hope otherwise 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.070
 of course, that somehow representative 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.930
 could be 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.900
 so that I have a lot of fun here 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.070
 but detective he might be interesting 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.860
 everything is okay for me too 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.320
 I mean I've been before 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.990
 a few weeks no travel main wants 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.240
 played more that means I have time 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.950
 right back on it and that sounds 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.150
 Maybe you can also get out I know it 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.520
 not as it looks like you 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.610
 In any case, I'm curious if 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.500
 I'll be directly trader here or not 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.280
 I know many in the shade again 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 yes no I can not do that with his 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.500
 chess joha detective okay not bad 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.460
 In any case, you can do it that way 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 let stand 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.300
 i would suggest i taken me 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 I would go here 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.209
 the house organ up on the break 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.009
 that means from who on the boat on it and 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.800
 Watch the situation from up here 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.150
 stop like a detective what people do 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.130
 I added a suppose I thought 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.459
 already he flies on I'll be fine 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.780
 paranoid people help message saver 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.200
 soja colleague what's going on down there 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.140
 capitano, what 's the trade doing? 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.020
 He makes everything so haas' nice word play 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.120
 he is so different in the foreground 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.220
 me about it 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 I will not come here I will 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.120
 I also liked that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 I will certainly still that I trust 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 somehow to me and if I knew where 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.209
 the tester is because I could also go 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.190
 but i am somehow afraid he 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.510
 honestly that's extra on me 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.400
 wait that was a round so 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.130
 and then just because of me 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 people like and then they slaughter me 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 could wait at the trader test 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.990
 me and then they do not kill 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.970
 that rom 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.640
 rump you old sow old whats going on drum 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.660
 Hello Rome 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.720
 well, I have the feeling that rom p 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.960
 tight as trader could be rom is 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 definitely rated at certainly better 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.650
 I would also like to buy but not 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.920
 Maybe not this time 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 also boring somehow boring oh 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:36.860
 no oh no that's the third corner around 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.080
 lps trader i feel that i 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.410
 like a blow in the back 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410
 to get 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.800
 why you remembered old sau walter 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.080
 First, I'm sorry that I'm here 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.460
 just something quieter was but I have 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.590
 that already correctly suspected that rom 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.050
 namely the trader was just the goods 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.630
 that's nice of a funny group 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.330
 On the way there you can only think okay 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.130
 that's twitter well, because that's the way it is 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.530
 quickly against where I say I would have 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.860
 just down again and therefore so 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.140
 to equal yes and that is going on here 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.420
 on the cathedrals map and I am 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.310
 looking forward to seeing the starter kits too 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.230
 yes get wollstein does not sword 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.540
 bad but above all floor and quiet 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.400
 sword and I would be perfectly equipped 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.970
 so the guests will be with the ewe 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.920
 taken away 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.990
 But there is actually on the map 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790
 enough boxes of it is also one more 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.270
 he diets well then I'll get me 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.560
 here the guests let me ran 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.560
 I need a wooden sword 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.140
 usually not but and new york 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.580
 you can take time so I think great 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.880
 I can not find boxes anymore 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.390
 then I'll go on it there 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.100
 above is a change calm and 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.750
 with the ndr further in the chest is just 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.790
 The iron is heavy there in nature 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.590
 keeper and I would have been happy 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.750
 further with the iron sword one has in 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.890
 the good fight already and I fight 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.990
 I'm not the only one here 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:19.670
 apparently such gestures knows damn 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.790
 no no let me just that was it 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.380
 so close 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.900
 Yes, Eisenstadt I did not want you 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.410

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.520
 lucio trader times look up the german 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.610
 in any case, I already have him in 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:41.100
 Step by step he saw me 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.080
 knows okay is not a trader it is not 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.340
 Trader actually stayed up there 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.590
 can now have a look 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.180
 who so suspiciously seems to me such a 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.520
 comes noticeable always becomes suspicious 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.920
 but I think it's not an ouch 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.920
 minecraft framework error i hate it 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:04.880
 so who could it be here once trader 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.880
 who will fight here then 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.890
 up there the colleague who comes to me 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.930
 weird 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:19.260
 Of course I'll just go up there 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.970
 Well, yes, I'm only on that 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.840
 Abandon belly and determined 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:28.560
 even no because I was not there 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.020
 even the pure abdominal feeling tells me 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.460
 that in bets down there too 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.030
 I'll tell you I'm all trader 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.510
 kill 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.650
 that would be something of genius that 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.010
 I did not experience it then 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.010
 never 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:57.950

00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:06.320

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:08.580
 well , damn good people 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.960
 You can not always win for it 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.440
 I'm pretty strong in the fight 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.770
 went 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.310
 yes I'm dead down here but for that 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.870
 we had a pretty nice one 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.140
 first round we have won 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.640
 and the second round that was through the 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.080
 Both coaches I killed but there 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.640
 also quite good so I should often 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.350
