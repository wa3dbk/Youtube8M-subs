00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello friends before you pilot 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.639
 release of new heading master in the tank 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.799
 heading in which I will try 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.980
 get masters on almost everyone 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.680
 tanks represented in our game and 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 The first video is dedicated to Germans 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 ninth level e75 many players it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 consider one of the best tyazh on level 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.270
 and indeed probably one of the best 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 tanks at the level I agree with them and 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.130
 I put this tank in one row with this Art-1 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 and t-54 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 let's get acquainted with him a little bit 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 take a closer look to start it 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.950
 I offer characteristics according to tradition 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 start with a tank cannon guns good 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.040
 armor penetration by a basic projectile two hundred 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.329
 forty six millimeters under the calf 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.430
 311 millimeters average one-time damage 460 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.530
 units by the way the largest at 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.710
 this is only u and 75 eu sneaker used which 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.060
 principle equipped with the same instrument 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.920
 armor penetration comfort base 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.219
 projectile you break through all that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.749
 meets you on a level with tanks 10 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.530
 level and but of course you have to charge 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.039
 pillars 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 and come slowly to the very 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.569
 interesting that can give us a tank 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.649
 his frontal reservation 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.679
 body upper frontal part 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.600
 booked in 160 millimeters forehead 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.060
 towers booked two hundred fifty two 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.579
 millimeter board and feed TP with this 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.329
 of course everything is much worse 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.799
 tower 160 millimeters overboard 160 feed 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.359
 housing 120 and 120 respectively 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.429
 considering these indicators it is clear that 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.969
 always need to be to the enemy 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.389
 forehead 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.369
 don't let yourself be surrounded 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.380
 opponents and do not go out 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.259
 simultaneously on two opponents because 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.719
 as if bypass you disassemble 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 you will have no difficulty also 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.959
 reload speed 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.859
 rammer is about 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:07.409
 fourteen seconds long enough 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.959
 so the most important thing on this tank is not 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.700
 to go anywhere alone is always necessary 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.730
 follow to be near allies 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.310
 who will be able to cover your sides and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.239
 karma that can support you in 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.220
 attack and also consider not weak 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.049
 tank dynamics that will not allow 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.209
 move quickly from flank to flank 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.030
 or 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.030
 take a quick stance and change it to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.110
 case of an erroneous position choice closer to 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.030
 the dynamics on solid ground tank rides 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 forward with a maximum speed of 30 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 kilometers per hour generally passport 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.489
 maximum speed 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.379
 is 40 kilograms often 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.420
 it is achieved only when moving 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.069
 from the hill or from the mountain 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 moving speed at medium and and weak 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.790
 ground does not exceed twenty two 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.609
 kilometers per hour backward speed 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.609
 limited to 12 kilometers per hour that 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.390
 also helps the enemy's medium tanks 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.970
 easy to twist us in melee 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 tank weight is 92 tons 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.319
 900 horsepower engine that gives us 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.690
 roughly ten horsepower on 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.870
 ton dynamics fully reflects 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.980
 the name of the tank is a heavy tank 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.680
 appropriate style of play and style 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.859
 moving around the map 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.680
 tank overview 250 meters indicator 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.220
 good for the level you can calmly 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.560
 light strands themselves with the enemy points 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.650
 Spd of course there will be problems well, in principle 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.720
 they have all the tanks because our 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.569
 blue friends standing in the bushes do not glow 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.669
 almost to the entrance to them close 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.599
 there will not give 50 meters only you can 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.130
 notice either after the shot let's 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.099
 let's move on to the recommendations for 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.230
 actually playing on the tank in order to 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.230
 get a master for master me 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.930
 It took about 1400 net experience 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.349
 without a premium account, be guided by 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.200
 these numbers are in principle absolutely correct 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.209
 and almost every week 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.419
 the minimum threshold of the master is not much 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.449
 changes and so the first and most important 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.150
 like i said never go to 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:20.810
 detach from allies constantly act 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.030
 with them because the E75 is the direct 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.190
 confirmation of the phrase and one in the field not 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.290
 warrior if you land 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
 sleep and nick one-on-one problem there 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.240
 you can always tuck in his forehead 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.110
 get up a diamond to him if you support 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.660
 second opponent especially if it's st 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.960
 In principle, the problems have already begun because 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.810
 how does he bypass you in board and disassemble 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.810
 without any problems the second 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.790
 be smart in choosing a direction 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.390
 try not to drive in the direction 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.700
 medium tanks come up with strands for 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.700
 of this tank proper it is intended 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.210
 he performs best 3 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.170
 if you see, for example, a shot opponent 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.630
 and the opponent with full HP try 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.520
 shoot at the opponent's ear and therefore how 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.010
 cancer do more damage and get 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.080
 more experience is critical for 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.640
 getting achivki master in battles with 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.330
 ninth eight month levels that is in 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.830
 top you can be a little impudent and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.900
 still risk going forward because 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.970
 how frontal armor will forgive 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.470
 Many of your mistakes, many opponents 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.410
 you just do not break through 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.540
 if you are in a battle with dozens 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.480
 best act being on 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.669
 second line being a support tank and 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.770
 just seeing that opponents on 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:50.520
 flank a little then you can take 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:53.160
 active fighting do not disdain 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.830
 also capturing the base or knocking it down 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.750
 by capturing the base use it only 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.140
 only cases when you see that otherwise 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.980
 the battle does not win if there is 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.020
 opportunity 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.840
 finish off the enemy is better to finish because 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.580
 how for damage on enemies give more experience 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.820
 than for the capture of the base well and briefly about the fight 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.730
 as short as possible went into battle on the map 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.700
 lost temple hit the top prodili 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.620
 up the temple itself itself there does not become 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.260
 or no practical resistance 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.600
 a small mistake was made popped up 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.540
 write four good she was 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.250
 stock I was lucky we did not merge into 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.380
 I was counting on this principle, but 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.770
 an opponent caught inexperienced could me 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.910
 calmly twist me instead 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.980
 saved and just 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.050
 ran escaped from the fight gradually 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.770
 we finish sex square-4 rose to capture 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.200
 because I was afraid to ride on the map 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.900
 search for 44-ku that could just kind of 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.970
 put in the corner and reduce the fight to a draw but 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.620
 she pulled up gave me a warrior and 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.650
 together with this the soldiers gave me 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.200
 masters are now in front of you will 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.480
 fight for the master to me in this 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.590
 It took 2000 experience with 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.620
 premium account 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:14.600
 I caused 5600 damage in principle 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.600
 good performance for this tank 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.910
 similar indicators are repeated 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.420
 almost every week that is there 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.920
 1350 experience threshold another 400 pure as i 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.090
 already said see the results 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.640
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.900
 thank you for your attention with you was proud 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.900
 he thanks everyone everybody bye
