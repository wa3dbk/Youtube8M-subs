them<00:04:24.469> heavily<00:04:24.620> that's<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.610> core<00:04:25.820> gameplay<00:04:26.060> of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
them heavily that's the core gameplay of

them heavily that's the core gameplay of
the<00:04:26.539> game

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
the game

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.370 
the game
now<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:28.030> other<00:04:28.150> core<00:04:28.480> gameplay<00:04:28.750> part<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.320> that

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
now the other core gameplay part is that

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.650 
now the other core gameplay part is that
there<00:04:29.710> are<00:04:29.740> three<00:04:30.100> types<00:04:30.370> of<00:04:30.550> armor<00:04:30.910> well

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
there are three types of armor well

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.570 
there are three types of armor well
basically<00:04:32.050> only<00:04:32.290> two<00:04:32.470> but<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.830> say<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:33.370> three

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
basically only two but I say this three

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.670 
basically only two but I say this three
or<00:04:33.700> four<00:04:33.910> there's<00:04:34.480> phase-shift<00:04:35.170> armor<00:04:35.500> which

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
or four there's phase-shift armor which

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.040 
or four there's phase-shift armor which
you<00:04:35.890> use<00:04:36.160> which<00:04:36.670> protects<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.510> from<00:04:37.540> energy

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
you use which protects you from energy

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.540 
you use which protects you from energy
but<00:04:38.320> if<00:04:38.410> you're<00:04:38.560> picked<00:04:38.800> up<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:39.070> thrown<00:04:39.100> you

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
but if you're picked up and thrown you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.980 
but if you're picked up and thrown you
can<00:04:39.670> still<00:04:39.850> take<00:04:40.000> damage<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.750> your<00:04:40.810> base

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
can still take damage to your base

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.930 
can still take damage to your base
number<00:04:41.170> base<00:04:41.650> armor<00:04:41.980> is<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.220> most<00:04:42.490> armor<00:04:42.790> that

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
number base armor is the most armor that

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.110 
number base armor is the most armor that
most<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> mobile<00:04:43.420> suits<00:04:43.720> use<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:45.190> we

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
most of the mobile suits use and is we

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.460 
most of the mobile suits use and is we
comment<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.540> is<00:04:46.630> weak<00:04:46.750> against<00:04:46.960> lasers<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
comment that is weak against lasers and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.980 
comment that is weak against lasers and
everything<00:04:47.710> else<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:49.030> never<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.600> has<00:04:49.960> a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
large bar that eventually runs out and

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.480 
large bar that eventually runs out and
it<00:04:53.410> doesn't<00:04:53.740> run<00:04:53.830> out<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.070> doesn't<00:04:54.190> make<00:04:54.310> any

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
it doesn't run out and doesn't make any

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.800 
it doesn't run out and doesn't make any
mobile<00:04:54.640> shoots<00:04:54.850> tall<00:04:55.090> then<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.420> have<00:04:55.570> just

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
mobile shoots tall then you have just

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.800 
mobile shoots tall then you have just
armor<00:04:56.200> which<00:04:56.740> if<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.490> you're<00:04:57.880> thrown<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.510> get

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
armor which if you you're thrown you get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.210 
armor which if you you're thrown you get
damp<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.320> don't<00:04:59.470> get<00:04:59.560> damaged<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.040> just

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
damp you don't get damaged you just

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.890 
damp you don't get damaged you just
can't<00:05:00.430> move<00:05:00.640> for<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.850> little<00:05:01.000> bit<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:01.720> this

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
can't move for a little bit then this

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.450 
can't move for a little bit then this
transphase<00:05:02.470> armor<00:05:02.740> which<00:05:02.860> has<00:05:02.980> nothing<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.310> do

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
transphase armor which has nothing to do

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.040 
transphase armor which has nothing to do
which<00:05:03.580> is<00:05:03.610> probably<00:05:04.450> more<00:05:04.570> defensive<00:05:05.020> than

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
which is probably more defensive than

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.080 
which is probably more defensive than
phase<00:05:05.320> shift<00:05:05.560> armor<00:05:05.800> anyways<00:05:06.460> that's<00:05:06.760> the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
phase shift armor anyways that's the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.940 
phase shift armor anyways that's the
core<00:05:07.330> gameplay<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.990> game<00:05:08.170> when<00:05:08.710> we<00:05:08.800> get
