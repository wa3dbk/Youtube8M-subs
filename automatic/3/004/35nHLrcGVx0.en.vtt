that<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.549> cause<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> least<00:01:17.970> amount<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that would cause the least amount of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.980 
that would cause the least amount of
fuss<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.259> opinion<00:01:22.220> there<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.990> they

you know yeah in that sense but still um
no<00:02:04.469> no<00:02:04.530> what's<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.950> there<00:02:05.689> let<00:02:06.689> me<00:02:06.719> see

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
no no what's going on there let me see
it<00:02:06.990> looks<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> earth<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.920> danger<00:02:08.129> in

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it looks like the earth is in danger in

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.990 
it looks like the earth is in danger in
this<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:10.020> hoping<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
this one which I'm really hoping that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.290 
this one which I'm really hoping that
they<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> whole<00:02:13.050> new

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
they would go to like a whole new

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.550 
they would go to like a whole new
planet<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> plot

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
planet and that there have a plot

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.230 
planet and that there have a plot
surrounding<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.160> now<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:16.210> have

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
surrounding that now that would have

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.620 
surrounding that now that would have
been<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.660> ideal<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:18.300> unfortunately<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.480> is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
been my ideal but unfortunately this is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.840 
been my ideal but unfortunately this is
what<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.900> got<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.340> might<00:02:21.460> still<00:02:21.670> turned

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
what we got but it might still turned

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
what we got but it might still turned
out<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.120> great<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.360> don't<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:23.020> I'm<00:02:23.110> not

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
out to be great I don't know I'm not

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.570 
out to be great I don't know I'm not
gonna<00:02:23.350> judge<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.800> whole<00:02:24.010> movie<00:02:24.280> based<00:02:24.460> on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
gonna judge the whole movie based on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.870 
gonna judge the whole movie based on
this<00:02:24.730> trailer<00:02:25.530> anyways<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.550> looks

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
this trailer anyways so we have looks

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.330 
this trailer anyways so we have looks
like<00:02:28.030> San<00:02:28.780> Francisco<00:02:28.810> being<00:02:29.440> destroyed<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
like San Francisco being destroyed a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.640 
like San Francisco being destroyed a
ship<00:02:31.120> might<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> enterprise<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> doubt

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
ship might be the enterprise but I doubt

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.270 
ship might be the enterprise but I doubt
it<00:02:32.830> crashing<00:02:33.370> into<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> water<00:02:34.570> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it crashing into the to the water I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
it crashing into the to the water I
seriously<00:02:36.280> doubt<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> enterprise<00:02:37.920> um

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
seriously doubt that the enterprise um

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.000 
seriously doubt that the enterprise um
the<00:02:39.220> shot<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:40.230> Kirk<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.380> McCoy<00:02:41.470> running

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
the shot of Kirk and McCoy running

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.590 
the shot of Kirk and McCoy running
through<00:02:42.130> this<00:02:42.220> red<00:02:42.550> forest<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.270> beginning

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
through this red forest at the beginning

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.630 
through this red forest at the beginning
jazz<00:02:44.170> really<00:02:44.410> excited<00:02:44.710> about<00:02:44.800> because<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.220> love

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
jazz really excited about because I love

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.990 
jazz really excited about because I love
Karl<00:02:46.030> Urban<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.750> love<00:02:46.960> McCoy<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.650> my<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.550> was

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
Karl Urban and I love McCoy so my I was

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.460 
Karl Urban and I love McCoy so my I was
immediately<00:02:49.240> looking<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:49.870> him<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
immediately looking for him in the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.640 
immediately looking for him in the
trailer<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:51.780> has<00:02:52.780> got<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.320> on<00:02:53.470> another

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
trailer that has got to be on another

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.680 
trailer that has got to be on another
planet<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.280> I'm<00:02:54.430> assuming<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.420> takes

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
planet so I'm assuming that that takes

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.870 
planet so I'm assuming that that takes
place<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.170> beginning<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.950> he's<00:02:57.400> kind<00:02:57.850> of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
place in the beginning and he's kind of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.760 
place in the beginning and he's kind of
unrelated<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> main<00:02:58.810> plot<00:02:59.050> that's<00:02:59.590> my

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
unrelated to the main plot that's my

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.340 
unrelated to the main plot that's my
assumption<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:01.600> totally<00:03:01.720> wrong<00:03:02.050> but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
assumption I could be totally wrong but

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.110 
assumption I could be totally wrong but
anyway<00:03:02.830> I'm<00:03:03.220> excited<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.880> looks<00:03:04.000> like

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
anyway I'm excited that it looks like

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.640 
anyway I'm excited that it looks like
McCoy<00:03:04.390> gets<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.660> do<00:03:04.780> an<00:03:04.930> action<00:03:05.200> scene<00:03:05.470> at

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
McCoy gets to do an action scene at

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400 
McCoy gets to do an action scene at
least<00:03:05.800> one<00:03:06.040> um<00:03:06.910> I've<00:03:07.240> heard<00:03:07.420> Kirk<00:03:08.020> gets<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.260> love

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
least one um I've heard Kirk gets a love

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.690 
least one um I've heard Kirk gets a love
interest<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.070> assume<00:03:09.340> that's<00:03:09.460> the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
interest in this I assume that's the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.190 
interest in this I assume that's the
blonde<00:03:09.940> woman<00:03:10.120> we<00:03:10.420> keep<00:03:10.630> seeing<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.960> couple

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
blonde woman we keep seeing a couple

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.750 
blonde woman we keep seeing a couple
times<00:03:11.440> I've<00:03:11.680> heard<00:03:11.890> some<00:03:12.250> people<00:03:12.370> think<00:03:12.640> that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
times I've heard some people think that

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.800 
times I've heard some people think that
she's<00:03:13.000> Chappell<00:03:14.040> no<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.070> can't<00:03:15.640> be<00:03:15.880> Kirk<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
she's Chappell no I can't be Kirk and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.410 
she's Chappell no I can't be Kirk and
Chapel<00:03:17.230> that's<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:18.190> doesn't<00:03:18.430> seem<00:03:18.820> right<00:03:19.090> at

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
Chapel that's that doesn't seem right at

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.940 
Chapel that's that doesn't seem right at
all<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.630> mean<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.870> guess<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.200> could<00:03:20.440> be<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.680> new

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
all I mean I guess it could be a new

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.500 
all I mean I guess it could be a new
timeline<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.520> all<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.000> that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
timeline and all that but that that

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.470 
timeline and all that but that that
seems<00:03:22.780> really<00:03:23.020> weird<00:03:23.730> um<00:03:24.730> or<00:03:25.209> maybe<00:03:25.239> that's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
seems really weird um or maybe that's

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.110 
seems really weird um or maybe that's
not<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.750> love<00:03:26.020> interest<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:26.980> know<00:03:27.120> if

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
there is I've heard I heard someone

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.220 
there is I've heard I heard someone
speculate<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.760> this<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.299> makes<00:04:19.780> sense<00:04:19.989> to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
speculate and this this makes sense to

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.320 
speculate and this this makes sense to
me<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.890> would<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.310> Kirk<00:04:21.729> on<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.180> wrong

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
me that it would be Kirk on the wrong

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.700 
me that it would be Kirk on the wrong
side<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.780> glass<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.140> time<00:04:23.200> instead<00:04:23.590> of

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
side of the glass this time instead of

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.290 
side of the glass this time instead of
Spock<00:04:24.039> because<00:04:24.490> there's<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.910> line<00:04:25.090> in<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
Spock because there's the line in the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.090 
Spock because there's the line in the
trailer<00:04:25.950> what

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
trailer what

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.830 
trailer what
wouldn't<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.370> do<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.730> save<00:04:27.910> your<00:04:28.150> family<00:04:28.600> as

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
wouldn't you do to save your family as

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.400 
wouldn't you do to save your family as
it<00:04:29.500> focuses<00:04:29.950> on<00:04:30.100> curse<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.140> last

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
it focuses on curse so and the last

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.730 
it focuses on curse so and the last
movie<00:04:32.770> was<00:04:34.080> well<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.230> guess<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.560> was<00:04:35.650> about

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
movie was well I guess it was about

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.560 
movie was well I guess it was about
equal<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.790> themselves<00:04:36.940> never<00:04:37.330> mind

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
equal to that for themselves never mind

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.420 
equal to that for themselves never mind
but<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.650> think<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.980> would<00:04:39.070> make<00:04:39.250> more<00:04:39.370> sense

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
but I think that would make more sense

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.790 
but I think that would make more sense
if<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.090> Kirk<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.750> time<00:04:41.050> instead<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.440> Spock

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
if it's Kirk this time instead of Spock

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.260 
if it's Kirk this time instead of Spock
but<00:04:42.070> I'm<00:04:42.280> hoping<00:04:42.520> they<00:04:42.640> don't<00:04:42.730> do<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.030> at<00:04:43.120> all

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
but I'm hoping they don't do it at all

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.150 
but I'm hoping they don't do it at all
but<00:04:43.900> he<00:04:44.050> can<00:04:44.170> do<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.380> whole<00:04:44.500> sacrifice<00:04:45.010> thing

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
but he can do the whole sacrifice thing

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.040 
but he can do the whole sacrifice thing
but<00:04:45.280> don't<00:04:45.430> actually<00:04:45.610> end<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.240> with<00:04:46.690> one<00:04:46.900> of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
but don't actually end it with one of

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.780 
but don't actually end it with one of
them<00:04:47.170> dying<00:04:47.440> like<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:48.040> said<00:04:48.280> I'm<00:04:48.460> willing<00:04:48.760> to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.550 
them dying like I said I'm willing to
