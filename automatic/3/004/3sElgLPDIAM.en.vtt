time<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:24.810> 2014<00:01:25.410> most<00:01:25.650> likely<00:01:26.010> early<00:01:26.310> 2014

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
time in 2014 most likely early 2014

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
time in 2014 most likely early 2014
maybe<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.140> guess<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> date<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.890> gotta

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
maybe if I have to guess a date I gotta

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.070 
maybe if I have to guess a date I gotta
say<00:01:29.430> februari<00:01:29.940> because<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.480> gumball<00:01:30.810> was

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
say februari because I think gumball was

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.420 
say februari because I think gumball was
starting<00:01:31.530> training<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:32.010> now<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
starting training right now is the

starting training right now is the
training<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.910> now<00:01:32.940> so<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:33.810> guessing

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
training right now so I'm guessing

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
training right now so I'm guessing
februari<00:01:34.800> sometime<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.370> februari<00:01:35.940> but

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
februari sometime around februari but

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.960 
februari sometime around februari but
