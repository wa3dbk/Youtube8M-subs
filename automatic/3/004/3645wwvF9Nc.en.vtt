the<00:00:51.470> japanese<00:00:51.920> version<00:00:52.540> as<00:00:53.540> far<00:00:53.869> as<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
the japanese version as far as the

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.329 
the japanese version as far as the
dialogue<00:00:54.860> there<00:00:55.699> is<00:00:55.909> some<00:00:57.040> from<00:00:58.040> what<00:00:58.190> i<00:00:58.220> could

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
dialogue there is some from what i could

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.390 
dialogue there is some from what i could
see<00:00:58.580> in<00:00:59.330> some<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.170> clips<00:01:00.619> there<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.369> a

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
see in some of the clips there is a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.219 
see in some of the clips there is a
little<00:01:01.760> bit<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:02.000> English<00:01:03.189> quirkiness<00:01:04.189> in<00:01:05.229> in

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
little bit of English quirkiness in in

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.780 
little bit of English quirkiness in in
the<00:01:06.710> dialogue<00:01:07.659> but<00:01:08.659> overall<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:09.500> looks<00:01:09.790> pretty

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
the dialogue but overall it looks pretty

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.100 
the dialogue but overall it looks pretty
good<00:01:11.120> so<00:01:11.180> far<00:01:11.390> my<00:01:12.020> only<00:01:12.320> main<00:01:12.980> problem<00:01:13.850> and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
good so far my only main problem and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.230 
good so far my only main problem and
this<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:15.350> probably<00:01:15.920> having<00:01:16.220> happening<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.210> a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
this is probably having happening to a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.590 
this is probably having happening to a
lot<00:01:17.300> of<00:01:17.480> people<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:18.460> can't<00:01:19.460> let<00:01:19.760> go<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:20.090> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
lot of people I can't let go of the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.450 
lot of people I can't let go of the

let go of that my earlier thoughts on
the<00:02:12.470> enemy<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:14.270> kind<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.950> its<00:02:15.950> kind<00:02:16.010> of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
the enemy so it's kind of its kind of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.300 
the enemy so it's kind of its kind of
deep<00:02:16.610> inside<00:02:17.300> me<00:02:17.569> as<00:02:17.810> terms<00:02:18.230> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
deep inside me as terms of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.030 
deep inside me as terms of
not<00:02:20.209> being<00:02:20.450> able<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:21.020> forget<00:02:21.349> about<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.770> when

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
not being able to forget about it when

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.229 
not being able to forget about it when
I'm<00:02:22.130> trying<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.550> experience<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.420> new<00:02:23.530> version

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
I'm trying to experience a new version

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.910 
I'm trying to experience a new version
so<00:02:26.239> i<00:02:26.930> will<00:02:27.830> probably<00:02:28.069> either<00:02:28.310> not<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
so i will probably either not like it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.130 
so i will probably either not like it
eventually<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.340> used<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> or<00:02:32.480> i<00:02:32.510> will<00:02:32.810> just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
eventually get used to it or i will just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.580
