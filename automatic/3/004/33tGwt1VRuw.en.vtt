00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.080
 welcome you guys and girls and this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.790
 already the third Sunday of this month 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 dedicated to the ninja turtles after 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.440
 the release of the first part in which I 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
 talked about mini figures of turtles me 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.810
 started asking, well, when will I do 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.480
 video about the villains in this series apparently 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.390
 many of you have watched this video on 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 my life channel by the way links to both 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 videos will be in the description for the occasion 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.090
 if you haven't watched them and we start 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.120
 As background, my shirt or rather I 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 outside me long won t-shirts with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 very cool art on which 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.559
 depicts my favorite character from 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149
 ninja turtles universe 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.820
 details about where and how I won 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.149
 look at this t-shirt in this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 video , by the way, is also in the description 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.440
 however today you all have gathered 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.199
 screens not to hear how 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 and where I won a t-shirt for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.810
 to see another review and so 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 as I said, we are not complete 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 collection unfortunately we do not have krang 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.970
 so here it looks on the package so 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.729
 that today we look at all four 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 the figures are 5 villains and for starters i 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 I suggest taking a look at how the card 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 goodies 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.759
 in the back all the cards are the same and in principle 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.070
 they look like the front left 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.890
 serial number in the right title 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 character or his name plus one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.350
 a sentence characterizing it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.689
 the central part is reserved for 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 character image just below three 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.310
 up to four lines of text in which 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.159
 some feature is told 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 in this case, the villain is well and in the bottom 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 the left corner of the inscription 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 clan foot team or foot clan 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.520
 someone like more and in the right 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.100
 respectively, the team logo is the same 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.679
 sometimes all the cards go to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.619
 figures and a couple of villains for some reason 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.869
 were packed more carefully than all 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.759
 other figures they were 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.160
 bags in such here 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.130
 open blisters which is essential 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 eases their search however start i 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.650
 I propose to dock pound immediately note 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.200
 that, like the turtles, these figures too 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.540
 compatible with designers type oleg 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.360
 last video I showed how they 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 fastened by these holes 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.970
 to the constructor, and in the case of the mastiff, they 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.819
 deprive it also of the stability of the jambs 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.750
 in the design can also be noted here 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.209
 this growth 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.010
 which, if my memory serves me 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.160
 should be bones 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.319
 or spike but not 2 in the brush 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.350
 the rest of the figurine is in principle quite 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.350
 nice breath pound has drawing 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.470
 muzzles of the lower paws as well as designers 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.090
 bother to paint his pants further 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.329
 fish pace or fish head seems to be a chip 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 slightly veche called him sultry either 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.970
 either fishermen do not morning spikes like 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.310
 tell fishermen so fishermen i don't 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.190
 fundamentally what can be said for 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.250
 the figurine she is unlike the dock pounds 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.709
 sustainable in terms of parts she has everything in 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.200
 okay, but that's how it is 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.389
 it was got in this series of figures rather 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.540
 mediocre order with us 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.730
 painted eyes and teeth and on the body all 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.160
 metal parts next on 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.310
 queues we can not food the first thing 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 I want to note this is his posture in my opinion 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.100
 she's cool because she can't look 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.560
 quite interesting and not static what 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.710
 can definitely be noted as a plus to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.440
 pluses can be attributed 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.690
 and elaboration of small parts that are not 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.580
 looking at the scale 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.520
 present on all these slides in terms of 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.660
 painted all just gray painted 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.810
 hands and eyes 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.270
 And the red highlighted bandage as for me 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.440
 very interesting figure turned out a 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.530
 at last 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.230
 so to speak for dessert I left myself 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.120
 the main villain of all time by 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.360
 versions of turtle ninja 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.210
 wider hole overall I like this 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.360
 figurine well damn it could have been this 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.610
 character come up with a pose more interesting we 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.790
 I personally think no dynamics 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:28.090
 solid statics and it saddens 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.580
 details here everything is like everyone has and small 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.400
 and large parts and they are very thorough 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.760
 worked out that certain well a 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.820
 here his claws probably causes some 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.000
 reproaches they too mida that was u 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.310
 Rafael's weapon in terms of painting everything here 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.460
 normal steel is highlighted silver 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.470
 color on the pants did not regret 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.830
 dark purple hand paint flesh 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.040
 the colors of the eyes brought white as they say 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.380
 simple and angry when the whole collection 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.110
 standing on the shelf it looks very 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.080
 organically and I would even say very 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.480
 my observant is nice right 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 the viewer version is here and naturally not 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.190
 grab the crang 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.920
 and you are so well done and noticed it 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.530
 you sweetie for vigilance failing 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.710
 a line under two reviews I want to say 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.020
 just the fact that this collection is an amateur 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.390
 and I do not need to write husbands then 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.910
 here they praised them in real life 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.580
 turned out not so cool I just 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.120
 as usually happens, expressed his 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.250
 you can always leave your opinion 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.770

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.990
