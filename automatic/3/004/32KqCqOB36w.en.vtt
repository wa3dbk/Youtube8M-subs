need to now all you need to do is get to
the<00:00:46.710> power<00:00:46.920> room<00:00:47.250> turn<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> power<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the power room turn on the power this is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.420 
the power room turn on the power this is
the<00:00:48.450> first<00:00:48.719> step<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> find<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> power<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the first step so to find the power just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
the first step so to find the power just
follow<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> exact<00:00:51.120> path<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> take<00:00:51.960> here

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
alright so now we got the power on the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.740 
alright so now we got the power on the
next<00:01:15.100> step<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.550> find<00:01:15.970> out<00:01:16.150> where<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.450> cast

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750
