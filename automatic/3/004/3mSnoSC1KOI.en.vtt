00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
to be able to even craft daedric armor

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
to be able to even craft daedric armor
you<00:00:32.880> first<00:00:33.120> need<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> reach<00:00:33.570> 90<00:00:33.930> blacksmithing

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you first need to reach 90 blacksmithing

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.430 
you first need to reach 90 blacksmithing
and<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.790> reach<00:00:35.910> 90<00:00:36.180> blacksmithing<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.110> would

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and to reach 90 blacksmithing I would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
and to reach 90 blacksmithing I would
say<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> best<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
say that the best way to do that is to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690 
say that the best way to do that is to
just<00:00:39.329> mine<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.530> much<00:00:40.800> iron<00:00:41.160> ore<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just mine you know as much iron ore in

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
just mine you know as much iron ore in
particular<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.270> possible<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.989> also<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.160> know

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
particular as possible and also you know

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
particular as possible and also you know
collect<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> leather<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.539> basically

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
collect a lot of leather and basically

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.709 
collect a lot of leather and basically
what<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.590> after<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:48.239> smelt<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
what you do after that is you smelt the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
what you do after that is you smelt the
ore<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.410> iron<00:00:49.620> ingots<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ore and two iron ingots and you make a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
ore and two iron ingots and you make a
ton<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> ton<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.570> iron<00:00:51.960> daggers<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:53.280> iron

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
ton a ton of iron daggers because iron

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
ton a ton of iron daggers because iron
daggers<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.440> essentially<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> most

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
daggers are essentially the most

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
daggers are essentially the most
efficient<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:57.210> level<00:00:57.360> your

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
efficient way to level your

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.610 
efficient way to level your
blacksmithing<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.469> most

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
blacksmithing or one of the most

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
blacksmithing or one of the most
efficient<00:00:58.920> ways<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.370> of<00:01:00.149> course<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.719> know<00:01:00.809> if

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
efficient ways and of course you know if

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
efficient ways and of course you know if
you<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.140> across<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.649> ores<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.430> use

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you come across other ores you can use

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
you come across other ores you can use
those<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.329> make<00:01:03.480> other<00:01:03.660> items<00:01:04.049> but

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
those as well to make other items but

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
those as well to make other items but
just<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.010> general<00:01:05.040> iron<00:01:05.640> ore<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.570> most

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
just in general iron ore is the most

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.609 
just in general iron ore is the most
efficient<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.380> leveling<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.380> once<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> reach

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
efficient for leveling so once you reach

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
efficient for leveling so once you reach
ninety<00:01:10.860> blacksmithing<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.850> gonna
