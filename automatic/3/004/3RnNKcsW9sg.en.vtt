00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the city of paris and tokyo will remain 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.109
 together in two hours through 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 an airplane and good afternoon very good 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.570
 afternoons I'm passionate with the world of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.010
 the airplanes because in matter 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.559
 technological there is a lot and I think that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 for the year 2050 there will be a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.529
 kind of revolution in space 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.760
 aerial you'll have that last week 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.740
 we just present an airplane that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 It presented many technological advances 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 that is already molded directly with a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.350
 book so passengers can see 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 outside both day and night 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 in a very particular way we are going to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.859
 Share a report now so you can see 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 what this new one really means 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.850
 plane that was presented in paris that the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.620
 true that it is a project obviously and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.629
 which says that by 2050 it will be ready 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 a detail nothing else is that their engines 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.550
 they are going to feed on seaweed something 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.059
 as well as biofuel to be able 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.629
 obviously take care of the environment 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.629
 we'll see 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 [Music] 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.970
 the year 2050 seems to be the time in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.470
 which planes are going to revolutionize the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.770
 airspace with its advances 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.800
 technological is now presented in the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.690
 aeronautical salon de burgess paris one 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.760
 hypersonic aircraft that will fly to a 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.190
 four times the speed of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 sound twice more than the known 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 comfort 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 to represent distances the ship 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 You can travel madrid and japan in little 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.760
 more than two and a half hours on each trip 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 You can take 60 to 100 passengers 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.659
 will pollute and its turbos reactors 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.659
 destined for its takeoff will work 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.819
 based on algae 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.340
 the hypersonic transport plane with 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.259
 zero emission is for its acronym in English 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.630
 is a development that combines the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.880
 high technology commercial transportation 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.679
 impact and especially the added value 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 of caring for the environment with 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.670
 benefits superior to any 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.670
 plane known in the present 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.119
 well we have two trips then 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.229
 planned for the 2050 the plane 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.909
 technological we present the week 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.800
 last and on this plane that I think that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.390
 let's go a little bit weird, because 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.010
 It's similar to the concorde but more 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.300
 powerful many very powerful what 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.890
 we clarify the report is just that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.869
 it goes four times faster than it already 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.130
 known and also retired with with a 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.420
 plane that also marked the story in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.340
 Regarding speed and technology 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 that he had in the aeronautical space and is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.459
 also what it presents is not only 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.900
 the theme of speed but how to 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.730
 he said technologies for the care of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.290
 environment and that the engines are going to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.750
 be fed according to what they said and according to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.680
 reported today based on seaweed 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.019
 what really matters so good 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.820
 2050 we will see if it is fulfilled and it is in the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.820
 airspace for many
