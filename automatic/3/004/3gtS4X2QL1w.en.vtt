00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
for each loop which will loop through

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.200 
for each loop which will loop through
the<00:04:45.700> list<00:04:46.700> box<00:04:46.910> element<00:04:47.530> items<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:49.610> 4-h<00:04:50.480> is<00:04:52.210> so

eat right time start element so writer

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.990 
eat right time start element so writer
the<00:05:10.930> right<00:05:11.930> start<00:05:12.830> xi<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:14.560> xi<00:05:15.560> will<00:05:15.680> be<00:05:16.000> eaten

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
the right start xi and xi will be eaten

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.160 
the right start xi and xi will be eaten
and<00:05:17.950> then<00:05:18.950> we're<00:05:19.160> going<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.670> write<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.810> hidden

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
you took then we close the so right and

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.850 
you took then we close the so right and
element

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.760 

now<00:05:41.780> here<00:05:42.780> we're<00:05:42.990> going<00:05:43.170> to<00:05:43.380> end<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.580> document

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
now here we're going to end the document

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.100 
now here we're going to end the document
writer<00:05:46.770> dot<00:05:47.660> right<00:05:48.660> and<00:05:49.310> document<00:05:51.020> and<00:05:52.020> we're

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
writer dot right and document and we're

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.010 
writer dot right and document and we're
going<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.440> close<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:53.120> XML<00:05:54.120> text<00:05:54.390> writers<00:05:54.810> so

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
going to close the XML text writers so

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.850 
going to close the XML text writers so
writer<00:05:55.350> dot<00:05:55.680> close

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
writer dot close

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:06.230 
writer dot close
okay<00:05:58.860> so<00:05:59.850> I<00:06:03.230> think<00:06:04.230> we<00:06:04.620> we<00:06:04.920> can<00:06:05.040> test<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.460> so

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
okay so I think we we can test it so

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.480 
okay so I think we we can test it so
start<00:06:06.600> without<00:06:06.840> debugging<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:09.090> is<00:06:09.240> data<00:06:09.480> so

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
start without debugging this is data so

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.810 
start without debugging this is data so
test<00:06:11.490> title<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:13.500> we<00:06:13.560> could<00:06:13.770> add<00:06:14.040> elements<00:06:14.580> so

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
test title and we could add elements so

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.770 
test title and we could add elements so
test

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.280 

Tony<00:06:21.410> Cottee

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
Tony Cottee

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.709 
Tony Cottee
etc<00:06:24.150> then<00:06:25.150> we<00:06:25.180> save<00:06:25.510> it<00:06:25.630> files<00:06:25.840> so

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.519 

so<00:06:29.319> okay<00:06:29.649> now<00:06:30.219> we're<00:06:30.369> going<00:06:30.580> to<00:06:30.959> check<00:06:31.959> if<00:06:32.169> the

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:32.529 
so okay now we're going to check if the

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:45.299 
so okay now we're going to check if the
file<00:06:32.769> has<00:06:32.949> been<00:06:33.249> made<00:06:33.429> so

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:45.309 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:48.210 

and<00:06:45.699> wait<00:06:45.969> a<00:06:45.999> second

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
and wait a second

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.240 
and wait a second
we<00:06:48.730> tested<00:06:49.140> title

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.900 

yeah<00:06:52.820> had<00:06:53.090> to<00:06:53.270> save<00:06:53.480> projects<00:06:54.310> trying<00:06:55.310> coding

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
yeah had to save projects trying coding

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.530 
yeah had to save projects trying coding
and<00:06:56.650> save<00:06:57.650> it
