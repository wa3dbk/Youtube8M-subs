 so that's more than the 458 spider 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.450
 the first thing that is super 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 important is first to turn on the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
 570 horses in the back and that's very 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.750
 simple one turns the key to the end 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 foot on the brake and press een 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.699
 start and we 'll hear the music from 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.699

 we leave but or partially but good 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.680
 we go to the adventure, however, went 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 a beautiful adventure 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 not in the name of nature but we will cheat 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 that's what this fuck is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.610
 the elite is the month of any goat 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 the week that was done by the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 teams all the way back leaves emile and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.289
 who really seems to discover the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 roads that the garbage cans of france all 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.370
 that in a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.229
 do a detailed hyper 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.780
 it's left 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.450
 we will limit them to the back begins 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.670
 exploit it behind 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.600
 and we have 570 horses it's a car 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.010
 which is placed in the high end 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.479
 for a car dolce vita we will say 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.979
 hair in the most extreme wind will 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.820
 Ivorians can take a lot 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.290
 fun on the streets on the circuits 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.700
 thomas if my memories are good on the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.320
 auto tour these are rather old 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.090
 who are participating or we are in a 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.009
 car right so what is our 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 legitimacy she participated in this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.310
 test but simply because 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.060
 the auto and ferrari tour is a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.470
 story that would give more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.730
 many years 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.319
 and then it allows me to discover a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.390
 modern car for our customers and for 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.870
 the press how to represent in a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.489
 event was well organized on 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.830
 superb so there are customers who 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.660
 ride in ferrari presents 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.800
 and then there are also customers who make 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.230
 participate their old cars 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.970
 since you have a lot of cars 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.260
 engaged I believe we have thirty or so 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.190
 committed cars we do not know 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.870
 really accumulated receivables from 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.550
 collectors because it's people 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.120
 who have very beautiful cars there in 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.280
 as a chef 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.080
 demo concerned the pros who gather 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 wonderful cars and 17 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.880
 different nationalities since we have 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.500
 foreigners we have good 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.990
 eric a disaster combining exeter 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.890
 since in France we have homeland monks who 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.780
 allows us to have roads 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.100
 beautiful and changing in each 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.090
 step and that's why there is a 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 also international success 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.460
 on the auto turn have only thirty 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.380
 of iron is engaged but overall 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.550
 combine these two cars or 250 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.770
 we are the most represented brand 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.040
 but there are 250 cars on the highway 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.239
 Laurentian 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.860
 with cars like mark a 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.710
 really the story of the weather on Thursday 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 how much is me the jaguar type e 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.340
 who have marked the automobile and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 the history of the auto tour since that's it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.730
 the principle in this new edition 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.980
 of the auto tour is to participate 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.230
 cars that drove back then 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.590
 have done before the auto turn that over the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.140
 self france time 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.000
 and in at 186 financial kcderc the rate 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.620
 found arrested and patrick lender in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.500
 1900 that everything is decided to do the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.300
 first flight of the tourtour and so that makes 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.890
 two years now that it exists and that 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.959
 a phenomenal success more and more 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.819
 because they are no longer being selected 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.819
 actually the authors present pretty much 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.819
 700 of 1,250,300 cars a year 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.620
 good so first step 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.410
 a rather exceptional car 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.750
 still very accurate 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.620
 it's surgical is an excellent v8 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.210
 so now for the moment a lot 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.770
 a lot of fun driving her 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.210
 except that this afternoon will be more 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.100
 the same thing I think because he 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.210
 start the time starts to get covered 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.210
 and spoil 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.060
 what we will be able to do a little 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.950
 still ride on the roads against there 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.510
 will have to be a little careful there 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.070
 had terrified crazy that a little wet 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.010
 but I think we will still take 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.940
 a little fun and damon and then some 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.440
 people who are hot so we can 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.440
 go go on the road 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.939
 now I come to the picture this is the 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.840
 limoges sun yes that's the task 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.840
 and Peter 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:40.349
 we see the practical farce in limoges well 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:42.720
 long matured moment long awaited 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.699
 you want them I have a little surprise 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.740
 for the mans and me it was also 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.830
 step 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.830
 c
