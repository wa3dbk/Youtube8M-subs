00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.720 
options of all the other ways to go but
that<00:04:41.770> probably<00:04:41.950> works<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.310> all<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.580> other

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
that probably works in all the other

I'm noodling but um that's you know
that's<00:05:23.880> probably<00:05:24.000> how<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.240> play<00:05:24.450> that<00:05:24.750> I'd

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
that's probably how I play that I'd

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.090
