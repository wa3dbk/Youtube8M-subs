we're<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> assembly<00:01:16.729> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're just going to do the assembly so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
we're just going to do the assembly so
four<00:01:18.210> screws<00:01:18.570> thread<00:01:19.170> lock<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.830> mounts<00:01:20.100> our

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
four screws thread lock the mounts our

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
four screws thread lock the mounts our
servo<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:23.119> make<00:01:24.119> sure<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.990> spline<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
servo here make sure that the spline is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.510 
servo here make sure that the spline is
to<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> back<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> rig<00:01:28.189> gives<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to the back of the rig gives you the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.810 
to the back of the rig gives you the
proper<00:01:29.850> throw<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.540> steering<00:01:31.610> all<00:01:32.610> right

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
proper throw for your steering all right

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420 
proper throw for your steering all right
so<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.150> mock<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.750> motor<00:01:34.100> make<00:01:35.100> sure<00:01:35.280> we

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so just mock up that motor make sure we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.140 
so just mock up that motor make sure we
have<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> proper<00:01:35.700> hardware<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> two

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
have the proper hardware here so two

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.899 
have the proper hardware here so two
screws<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.909> our<00:01:42.150> opinion<00:01:43.520> line<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.729> up

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
screws and then our opinion line that up

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.990 
screws and then our opinion line that up
to<00:01:45.090> our<00:01:45.210> spur<00:01:45.890> good<00:01:46.890> mesh<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> just

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to our spur good mesh and when you just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.840 
to our spur good mesh and when you just
lock<00:01:48.240> everything<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:51.630> right<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.700> now<00:01:53.700> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lock everything down all right so now to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.840 
lock everything down all right so now to
move<00:01:54.090> our<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.899> bumper<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.070> carbon

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
move our way to the bumper so the carbon

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.039 
move our way to the bumper so the carbon
fiber<00:01:57.030> piece<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.540> sits<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> lip<00:01:59.000> and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
fiber piece here sits over the lip and

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.950 
fiber piece here sits over the lip and
then<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.759> three<00:02:02.759> nose<00:02:03.180> re<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.659> counter

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
then you have three nose re to counter

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
then you have three nose re to counter
strong<00:02:04.170> screws<00:02:04.560> from<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> bottom<00:02:05.130> which<00:02:05.460> hold

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
strong screws from the bottom which hold

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.089 
strong screws from the bottom which hold
it<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> chassis<00:02:06.270> itself<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:09.619> hear<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it to the chassis itself I hear that it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
it to the chassis itself I hear that it
wrong<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.180> center<00:02:12.599> piece<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.959> should<00:02:13.170> look

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
wrong use the center piece I should look

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000 
wrong use the center piece I should look
at<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> holes

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
at the holes

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.339 
at the holes
ultimately<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.610> need<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.629> outside<00:02:16.019> of

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
ultimately you need to on the outside of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.339 
ultimately you need to on the outside of
the<00:02:16.560> chassis<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> far<00:02:19.110> side<00:02:19.319> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the chassis and to on the far side of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.550 
the chassis and to on the far side of
the<00:02:19.530> bump<00:02:19.739> piece<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> regardless<00:02:22.260> will<00:02:22.409> fake

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the bump piece so regardless will fake

there and just fish through all the
leads<00:03:32.239> double-sided<00:03:33.239> tape<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:34.019> we're<00:03:34.290> done

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
leads double-sided tape then we're done

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.000 
leads double-sided tape then we're done
with<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.590> piece<00:03:36.169> so<00:03:37.169> before<00:03:37.500> we<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:37.709> connect

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
with that piece so before we go connect

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.069 
with that piece so before we go connect
the<00:03:38.069> servo<00:03:38.280> horn<00:03:38.370> power<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.389> make<00:03:39.900> sure

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
the servo horn power it on make sure

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.159 
the servo horn power it on make sure
we're<00:03:40.260> centered<00:03:41.299> everything's<00:03:42.299> moving<00:03:42.690> no

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
we're centered everything's moving no

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.940 
we're centered everything's moving no
issues<00:03:45.380> so<00:03:46.380> now<00:03:46.500> I'm<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.739> take<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
issues so now I'm going to take the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.059 
issues so now I'm going to take the
plastic<00:03:47.130> horn<00:03:47.669> off<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.709> idea<00:03:49.950> I'm

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
plastic horn off I like the idea I'm

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.970 
plastic horn off I like the idea I'm
going<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.519> aluminum<00:03:50.880> horn<00:03:51.709> thread<00:03:52.709> lock

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
going with the aluminum horn thread lock

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.449 
going with the aluminum horn thread lock
get<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> nut<00:03:54.299> back<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:55.700> one<00:03:56.700> final<00:03:57.120> screw

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
get the nut back there one final screw

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.539 
get the nut back there one final screw
and<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.579> done<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:04.260> you'll<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:05.040> full

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and it's done so here you'll see a full

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.530 
and it's done so here you'll see a full
throw<00:04:07.069> nice<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.340> fast<00:04:08.609> could<00:04:09.269> be<00:04:09.359> better

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
throw nice and fast could be better

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150 
throw nice and fast could be better
faster<00:04:09.780> but<00:04:10.260> I'm<00:04:10.560> happy<00:04:10.859> with<00:04:10.949> it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
faster but I'm happy with it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.069 
faster but I'm happy with it
$40<00:04:11.849> servo<00:04:15.500> all<00:04:16.500> right<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:17.729> our<00:04:17.910> drive

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.450 

clearly<00:04:22.079> see<00:04:22.349> that<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.710> back<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:22.919> spinning

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
clearly see that the back is spinning

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.980 
clearly see that the back is spinning
much<00:04:23.580> faster<00:04:23.640> than<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.210> front<00:04:24.419> again<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.840> have

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
much faster than the front again I have

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.360 
much faster than the front again I have
to<00:04:25.110> look<00:04:25.229> I'm<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:25.469> sure<00:04:25.650> what<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.860> ratios<00:04:26.159> are

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
to look I'm not sure what the ratios are

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.570 
to look I'm not sure what the ratios are
but

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.520 

pretty<00:04:30.580> pretty<00:04:31.510> dramatic<00:04:32.020> compared<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
pretty pretty dramatic compared to the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.500 
pretty pretty dramatic compared to the
50/50<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.250> I'm<00:04:33.370> driving<00:04:33.700> now<00:04:36.030> all<00:04:37.030> right<00:04:37.180> so

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
50/50 that I'm driving now all right so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.470 
50/50 that I'm driving now all right so
I<00:04:37.750> guess<00:04:38.230> we'll<00:04:38.410> see<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:39.250> performance<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:40.150> on

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
I guess we'll see a performance out on
