the curse of the Senju energy huh and
now<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> curse<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.430> hour

now we know what that curse is an hour

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.660 
now we know what that curse is an hour
to<00:00:35.850> even<00:00:36.200> comparison<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.620> being<00:00:37.829> possessed<00:00:38.430> by

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
to even comparison to being possessed by

a ghost
we<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> Naruto<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> reincarnation

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
we know that Naruto is the reincarnation

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.889 
we know that Naruto is the reincarnation
of<00:00:41.910> our<00:00:42.540> Shura

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
of our Shura

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.410 
of our Shura
or<00:00:43.079> rather<00:00:43.320> our<00:00:43.860> Suresh<00:00:44.309> chakra<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> directly

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
or rather our Suresh chakra is directly

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
or rather our Suresh chakra is directly
influencing<00:00:46.260> Naruto<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.399> safe<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
influencing Naruto I think it's safe to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.389 
influencing Naruto I think it's safe to
assume<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.570> Asura<00:00:48.780> injurer<00:00:49.530> went<00:00:50.129> from

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
assume the Asura injurer went from

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
assume the Asura injurer went from
generation<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> generation<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.350> giving

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
generation to generation you know giving

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
generation to generation you know giving
that<00:00:52.829> chakra<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.750> reincarnating<00:00:54.750> themselves

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that chakra and reincarnating themselves

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.590 
that chakra and reincarnating themselves
inside<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:56.039> jihad<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.820> Singhji<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.449> would

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
inside of jihad and Singhji which would

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
inside of jihad and Singhji which would
explain<00:00:57.930> why<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> generations<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.699> she

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
explain why the generations of what she

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
explain why the generations of what she
hadn't<00:01:00.180> send<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.989> always<00:01:01.260> been

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
hadn't send you have always been

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.310 
hadn't send you have always been
fighting<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> next<00:01:03.390> generation<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
fighting and now the next generation is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.690 
fighting and now the next generation is
Naruto<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.129> Sasuke

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
Naruto and Sasuke

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
Naruto and Sasuke
way<00:01:05.970> back<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.780> Tobi<00:01:07.080> foreshadowed<00:01:07.710> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
way back then Tobi foreshadowed that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
way back then Tobi foreshadowed that
Naruto<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.000> Sasuke<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.780> continue<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
Naruto and Sasuke will continue this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039 
Naruto and Sasuke will continue this
curve<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.250> honestly<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.869> get

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
curve so honestly even if we don't get

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
curve so honestly even if we don't get
back<00:01:13.260> story<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.250> safe<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
back story I think it's safe to say that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
back story I think it's safe to say that
Sasuke<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.170> reincarnation<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.009> injurer

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Sasuke is the reincarnation of injurer

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
Sasuke is the reincarnation of injurer
or<00:01:17.610> interest<00:01:18.000> Rucker<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.659> inside<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.799> Sasuke

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
or interest Rucker is inside of Sasuke

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.210 
or interest Rucker is inside of Sasuke
directly<00:01:20.909> influencing<00:01:21.840> him<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.799> has<00:01:22.979> been

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
ten tails and think about this go back

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.800 
ten tails and think about this go back
to<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.340> believe<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.060> persona<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.570> called

claimed that hog or MOU took the chakra

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.910 
claimed that hog or MOU took the chakra
out<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.570> ten<00:03:46.780> tails<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.200> divided<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.800> up

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
out of the ten tails and divided it up

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.610 
out of the ten tails and divided it up
into<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.430> nine<00:03:48.610> tailed<00:03:48.940> beasts<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.540> he<00:03:50.020> took

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
into the nine tailed beasts and he took

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.980 
into the nine tailed beasts and he took
the<00:03:50.830> body<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.610> ten<00:03:51.820> tails<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.390> Herald<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
the body of the ten tails and Herald it

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.260 
the body of the ten tails and Herald it
up<00:03:53.170> into<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.650> sky<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.220> became<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.700> moon

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
up into the sky and it became the moon

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.920 
up into the sky and it became the moon
now<00:03:55.540> if<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.110> ten<00:03:56.380> tails<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:57.360> inside<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.480> modern

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
now if the ten tails is inside of modern

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.290 
now if the ten tails is inside of modern
rock<00:03:59.110> why<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.860> moon<00:04:00.040> still<00:04:00.430> there<00:04:00.670> why<00:04:00.910> is

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
rock why is the moon still there why is

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.470 
rock why is the moon still there why is
the<00:04:01.750> original<00:04:02.590> body<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.610> ten<00:04:03.850> tails<00:04:04.060> still

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
the original body of the ten tails still

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.840 
the original body of the ten tails still
up<00:04:04.690> there<00:04:04.750> my<00:04:05.200> prediction<00:04:05.770> is<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.610> there

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
up there my prediction is it's out there

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.810 
up there my prediction is it's out there
it's<00:04:07.060> far<00:04:07.360> out<00:04:07.600> there<00:04:07.959> what<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:08.890> moderates

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
it's far out there what if moderates

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.470 
it's far out there what if moderates
brother

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
brother

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.710 
brother
if<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.840> ten<00:04:11.050> tails<00:04:11.290> inside<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.370> him<00:04:12.730> what<00:04:13.480> if

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
if the ten tails inside of him what if

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.690 
if the ten tails inside of him what if
he<00:04:14.020> couldn't<00:04:14.320> control<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.250> was<00:04:15.370> taking

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
he couldn't control it and it was taking

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.360 
he couldn't control it and it was taking
over<00:04:15.820> him<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.660> how<00:04:17.200> core<00:04:17.410> mole<00:04:17.620> had<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:17.980> do<00:04:18.130> what

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
over him so how core mole had to do what

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.640 
over him so how core mole had to do what
he<00:04:18.520> had<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.730> do<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.330> he<00:04:19.720> sealed<00:04:20.020> his<00:04:20.320> brother

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
he had to do and he sealed his brother

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.400 
he had to do and he sealed his brother
up<00:04:20.950> there<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.489> what<00:04:21.940> if<00:04:22.180> his<00:04:22.390> brother<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:23.140> the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
up there and what if his brother is the

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.260 
up there and what if his brother is the
moon<00:04:23.620> itself<00:04:24.100> I'm<00:04:24.310> predicting<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.090> his

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
moon itself I'm predicting that his

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.970 
moon itself I'm predicting that his
brother<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.660> sealed<00:04:26.140> in<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.500> moon

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
brother is sealed in the moon

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.040 
brother is sealed in the moon
and<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.430> would<00:04:27.580> explain<00:04:27.940> why<00:04:28.060> no<00:04:28.630> one<00:04:28.840> knows

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
and that would explain why no one knows

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.680 
and that would explain why no one knows
of<00:04:29.320> him<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.250> only<00:04:30.520> one<00:04:30.730> in<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.120> legends

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
of him like the only one in the legends

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.380 
of him like the only one in the legends
that<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.380> know<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.340> sage<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.610> six<00:04:33.970> paths

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
that we know of is the sage of six paths

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.690 
that we know of is the sage of six paths
himself<00:04:35.260> like<00:04:35.560> we've<00:04:35.770> never<00:04:36.010> heard<00:04:36.280> anything

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
himself like we've never heard anything

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.060 
himself like we've never heard anything
about<00:04:37.120> his<00:04:37.630> brother<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.230> also<00:04:38.470> explains

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
about his brother and this also explains

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.370 
about his brother and this also explains
why<00:04:39.250> there<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.700> one<00:04:39.910> ten<00:04:40.180> tails<00:04:40.420> down<00:04:40.750> here<00:04:41.200> and

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
why there is one ten tails down here and

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.250 
why there is one ten tails down here and
also<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.250> moon<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.760> still<00:04:43.030> intact<00:04:43.390> so<00:04:43.750> yes

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
also the moon is still intact so yes

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.510 
also the moon is still intact so yes
that's<00:04:44.530> my<00:04:44.710> prediction

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that's my prediction

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.820 
that's my prediction
the<00:04:45.670> hug<00:04:45.880> or<00:04:46.060> most<00:04:46.330> brother<00:04:46.630> couldn't<00:04:47.320> handle

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
the hug or most brother couldn't handle

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.070 
the hug or most brother couldn't handle
the<00:04:48.250> huge<00:04:48.640> amount<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.060> chakra<00:04:49.300> he<00:04:49.630> was<00:04:49.750> going

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
the huge amount of chakra he was going

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.380 
the huge amount of chakra he was going
crazy<00:04:50.350> destroying<00:04:51.010> everything<00:04:51.280> hog<00:04:51.970> or<00:04:52.150> mote

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
crazy destroying everything hog or mote

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.050 
crazy destroying everything hog or mote
had<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:53.170> throw<00:04:53.500> his<00:04:53.860> brother<00:04:54.190> up<00:04:54.430> in<00:04:54.610> there<00:04:54.790> no

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
had to throw his brother up in there no

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.870 
had to throw his brother up in there no
I<00:04:55.090> don't<00:04:55.390> think<00:04:55.450> Toby's<00:04:56.170> story<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:57.100> 100%

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
I don't think Toby's story is 100%

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.030 
I don't think Toby's story is 100%
accurate<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.260> mean<00:04:59.530> how<00:04:59.650> could<00:04:59.920> it<00:05:00.010> be

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
accurate because I mean how could it be

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.440 
accurate because I mean how could it be
he<00:05:00.340> wasn't<00:05:00.700> there<00:05:00.850> because<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.300> just

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
he wasn't there because that just

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.150 
he wasn't there because that just
wouldn't<00:05:01.690> make<00:05:01.810> any<00:05:02.080> sense<00:05:02.110> if<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.950> moon<00:05:03.130> is

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
wouldn't make any sense if the moon is

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.600 
wouldn't make any sense if the moon is
made<00:05:03.700> up<00:05:04.030> of<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.750> ten<00:05:05.020> tails<00:05:05.320> original<00:05:06.220> body

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
made up of the ten tails original body

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.200 
made up of the ten tails original body
how<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.750> Mazo<00:05:08.230> on<00:05:08.440> earth<00:05:08.950> without<00:05:09.550> the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
how is the Mazo on earth without the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.990 
how is the Mazo on earth without the
moon<00:05:10.900> collapsing<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.770> know<00:05:11.950> so<00:05:12.370> now<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.610> we

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
moon collapsing you know so now that we

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.150 
moon collapsing you know so now that we
have<00:05:13.030> confirmation<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:14.530> there<00:05:14.740> was<00:05:14.920> yet

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
have confirmation that there was yet

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.520 
have confirmation that there was yet
another<00:05:15.580> half<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.300> ten<00:05:16.510> tails<00:05:16.720> inside<00:05:17.320> of

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
another half of the ten tails inside of

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.380 
another half of the ten tails inside of
another<00:05:17.710> person<00:05:18.250> being<00:05:18.850> hog<00:05:19.090> or<00:05:19.210> Moe's

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
another person being hog or Moe's

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.270 
another person being hog or Moe's
brother<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:20.230> just<00:05:20.260> makes<00:05:20.770> sense

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
brother that just makes sense

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.670 
brother that just makes sense
that<00:05:21.670> the<00:05:22.090> moon<00:05:22.300> is<00:05:22.690> either<00:05:23.080> hog<00:05:23.320> or<00:05:23.500> Mo's

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
that the moon is either hog or Mo's

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.950 
that the moon is either hog or Mo's
brother<00:05:23.920> or<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:25.120> half<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.600> ten<00:05:25.780> tails

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
brother or the half of the ten tails

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.600 
brother or the half of the ten tails
that<00:05:26.260> he<00:05:26.380> couldn't<00:05:26.650> control<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.220> think<00:05:27.490> about

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
that he couldn't control but think about

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.970 
that he couldn't control but think about
it<00:05:27.880> moderate<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.450> so<00:05:28.750> obsessed<00:05:29.290> with<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.770> moon

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
it moderate is so obsessed with the moon

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.400 
it moderate is so obsessed with the moon
and<00:05:30.280> hog<00:05:30.640> almost-brother<00:05:31.180> looked<00:05:32.110> like

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
and hog almost-brother looked like

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.560 
and hog almost-brother looked like
Madara<00:05:32.710> from<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.250> back<00:05:33.460> anyway<00:05:33.910> so<00:05:34.330> my

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
Madara from the back anyway so my

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.960 
Madara from the back anyway so my
prediction<00:05:35.200> is<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.770> hog<00:05:35.920> or<00:05:36.160> Mo's<00:05:36.460> brother

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
prediction is that hog or Mo's brother

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.170 
prediction is that hog or Mo's brother
is<00:05:37.470> possessing<00:05:38.470> murderer<00:05:39.250> or<00:05:39.580> having<00:05:39.970> some

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
that would be an awesome plot twist but

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.810 
that would be an awesome plot twist but
like<00:05:56.140> I<00:05:56.260> said<00:05:56.500> it's<00:05:56.920> a<00:05:57.040> crazy<00:05:57.430> out<00:05:57.760> there

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
theory and we know there was a

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.890 
theory and we know there was a
mysterious<00:06:00.010> figure<00:06:00.340> over<00:06:01.090> monitor<00:06:01.300> before<00:06:01.630> he

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
mysterious figure over monitor before he

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.930 
mysterious figure over monitor before he
got<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.170> render<00:06:02.380> guy<00:06:02.500> someone<00:06:03.130> pretty<00:06:03.700> much
