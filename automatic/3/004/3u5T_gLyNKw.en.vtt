you<00:01:47.759> why<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> second

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.419 

all<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.810> old<00:01:55.990> maids<00:01:56.289> in<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.770> crap<00:01:57.039> that's<00:01:57.219> on

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
all the old maids in the crap that's on

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.700 
all the old maids in the crap that's on
the<00:01:57.579> ground<00:01:57.789> guys<00:01:58.390> could<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.810> imagine<00:01:59.079> having

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
the ground guys could you imagine having

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.639 
the ground guys could you imagine having
anything<00:02:00.009> less<00:02:00.460> than<00:02:01.119> 1,500<00:02:01.960> holes<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.500> your

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
anything less than 1,500 holes in your

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.529 
anything less than 1,500 holes in your
sitting<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.189> cooling<00:02:03.460> table<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.270> just

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
sitting and cooling table it just

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.459 
sitting and cooling table it just
doesn't<00:02:04.840> make<00:02:04.929> sense

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
doesn't make sense

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.139 
doesn't make sense
I<00:02:05.500> could<00:02:05.740> put<00:02:05.890> more<00:02:06.039> holes<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.670> my<00:02:06.759> sifting<00:02:07.119> and

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
I could put more holes in my sifting and

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.749 
I could put more holes in my sifting and
cooling<00:02:07.509> table<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.959> would<00:02:08.369> hi<00:02:09.369> guys<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:09.700> is

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
cooling table I would hi guys this is

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.119 
cooling table I would hi guys this is
why<00:02:09.970> we<00:02:10.149> use<00:02:10.179> these<00:02:10.450> big<00:02:10.720> tubs<00:02:11.019> if<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.799> notice

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
why we use these big tubs if you notice

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.670 
why we use these big tubs if you notice
how<00:02:12.250> big<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.879> are<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.049> we<00:02:14.319> send<00:02:14.560> out

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
how big they are and I think we send out

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.030 
how big they are and I think we send out
6<00:02:14.980> or<00:02:15.129> 9<00:02:15.370> inch<00:02:15.610> tubs<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.769> we<00:02:17.769> use<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
6 or 9 inch tubs with it but we use the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.640 
6 or 9 inch tubs with it but we use the
big<00:02:18.220> tubs<00:02:18.489> because<00:02:18.970> our<00:02:19.599> sifting<00:02:20.349> cooling

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
big tubs because our sifting cooling

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.800 
big tubs because our sifting cooling
table<00:02:20.799> gets<00:02:21.040> rid<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.580> many<00:02:21.760> old<00:02:21.940> maids<00:02:22.209> if

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
table gets rid of so many old maids if

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
table gets rid of so many old maids if
you<00:02:23.019> had<00:02:23.140> some<00:02:23.410> wimpy<00:02:23.799> little<00:02:24.069> tub<00:02:24.400> that's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
you had some wimpy little tub that's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.000 
you had some wimpy little tub that's
like<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:25.030> big<00:02:25.299> or<00:02:25.690> tray<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.470> our<00:02:26.620> sifting

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
like this big or tray with our sifting

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.640 
like this big or tray with our sifting
and<00:02:27.069> cooling<00:02:27.430> table<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.720> would<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and cooling table it just would it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.190 
and cooling table it just would it
wouldn't<00:02:29.890> even<00:02:29.950> hold<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.840> old<00:02:31.959> mates

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
wouldn't even hold all the old mates

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.460 
wouldn't even hold all the old mates
that<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.530> gets<00:02:32.680> rid<00:02:32.829> of<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.130> you'll<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:34.000> that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that it gets rid of and you'll see that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690 
that it gets rid of and you'll see that
out<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> marketplace<00:02:36.340> there's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
out there in the marketplace there's

against the the top tray and that's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.550 
against the the top tray and that's
critical<00:03:25.030> guys<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.720> I'll<00:03:25.900> show<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.109> why<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.410> a

critical guys and I'll show you why in a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.890 
critical guys and I'll show you why in a
second<00:03:26.950> why<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.669> use<00:03:27.819> these<00:03:28.000> bins<00:03:28.299> these

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
second why we use these bins these

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.199 
second why we use these bins these
plastic<00:03:29.410> bins<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.859> actually<00:03:30.220> mount<00:03:30.459> fans<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
plastic bins we actually mount fans to

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.110 
plastic bins we actually mount fans to
our<00:03:31.329> bins<00:03:32.040> when<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.160> get<00:03:33.310> into<00:03:33.459> high-volume

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
our bins when we get into high-volume

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.620 
our bins when we get into high-volume
situations<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.680> critical<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:37.299> be<00:03:37.389> able<00:03:37.419> to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
situations it's critical to be able to

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.479 
situations it's critical to be able to
cool<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> popcorn<00:03:38.440> super<00:03:38.919> fast<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
cool the popcorn super fast so the

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.589 
cool the popcorn super fast so the
baggers<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.180> really<00:03:40.630> bag<00:03:40.930> quickly<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.599> so

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
baggers can really bag quickly and so

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.210 
baggers can really bag quickly and so
that's<00:03:43.780> why<00:03:43.930> we<00:03:44.079> mount<00:03:44.290> these<00:03:44.440> fans<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:45.010> there

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
that's why we mount these fans on there

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.339 
that's why we mount these fans on there
and<00:03:45.340> that's<00:03:45.489> why<00:03:45.609> we<00:03:45.730> use<00:03:45.760> these<00:03:46.000> awesome<00:03:46.840> bins

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
they're also really close and so here

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.339 
they're also really close and so here
