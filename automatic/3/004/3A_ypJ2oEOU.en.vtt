want to buy a magnetic wheel wrench what
I<00:00:15.809> need<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> thought<00:00:17.369> I'd<00:00:17.460> go

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I need it for so I thought I'd go

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.189 
I need it for so I thought I'd go
through<00:00:17.670> some<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.300> things<00:00:18.510> why<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.840> was

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
through some of the things why this was

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.730 
through some of the things why this was
kind<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.439> something<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.980> wanted<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> build

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
kind of something that I wanted to build

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
kind of something that I wanted to build
the<00:00:22.740> reason<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.730> changing<00:00:24.600> tires

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the reason is is when I'm changing tires

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.339 
the reason is is when I'm changing tires
I<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> tendency<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.220> drop<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.609> wheel<00:00:26.789> nut

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
I have a tendency to drop the wheel nut

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.689 
I have a tendency to drop the wheel nut
especially<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> panic<00:00:28.859> for

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
especially when I'm in a panic for

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
especially when I'm in a panic for
instance<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:30.269> say<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> try<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> set

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
instance let's say I want to try a set

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.910 
instance let's say I want to try a set
of<00:00:31.769> tires<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:33.059> before<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> main<00:00:33.719> I'll<00:00:34.710> have

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of tires just before the main I'll have

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
of tires just before the main I'll have
the<00:00:35.250> tires<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.700> want<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> test<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.450> then

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the tires that I want to test and then

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
the tires that I want to test and then
I'll<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> standbys<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> I'll<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I'll have the standbys that I'll go to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.139 
I'll have the standbys that I'll go to
if<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.570> set<00:00:39.809> doesn't<00:00:39.989> work<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:41.879> never

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
if the one set doesn't work and it never

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.670 
if the one set doesn't work and it never
fails<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.930> trying<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.260> hurry<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
fails that when I'm trying a hurry to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.360 
fails that when I'm trying a hurry to
change<00:00:43.710> tires

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
change tires

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.700 
change tires
I<00:00:44.579> dropped<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> wheel<00:00:45.270> nut<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.559> made

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I dropped the wheel nut so when we made

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.400 
I dropped the wheel nut so when we made
this<00:00:46.860> wheel<00:00:47.070> nut<00:00:47.660> first<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.930> did<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this wheel nut first thing we did is we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.279 
this wheel nut first thing we did is we
put<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.860> serrate<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.750> found<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.199> be

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
put a serrate on it that we found to be

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
put a serrate on it that we found to be
the<00:00:52.410> best<00:00:52.440> sri<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.850> bites<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the best sri it really bites into the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
the best sri it really bites into the
rim<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.320> holds<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> never<00:00:56.010> comes<00:00:56.309> off

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
rim and really holds it never comes off

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
rim and really holds it never comes off
as<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> matter<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> fact<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> tighten<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
as a matter of fact if you tighten it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
as a matter of fact if you tighten it
too<00:00:58.320> tight<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.640> have<00:01:00.329> quite<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
too tight you can actually have quite a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
too tight you can actually have quite a
time<00:01:00.840> getting<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.230> off<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:02.190> thing<00:01:02.460> we

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
time getting it off the other thing we

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
time getting it off the other thing we
so<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> magnetic<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> little

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so to make it magnetic we put a little

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
so to make it magnetic we put a little
screw<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> end<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.299> end<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
screw in the end and then this end is a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
screw in the end and then this end is a
magnet<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.700> locks<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
magnet and it locks in there so that it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420 
magnet and it locks in there so that it
will<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.830> long<00:01:14.310> as

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
will not come out this not as long as

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070 
will not come out this not as long as
you<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> there<00:01:15.270> it'll<00:01:15.570> stay<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> can

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you want it in there it'll stay you can

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
you want it in there it'll stay you can
drop<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> wrench<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.159> doesn't<00:01:17.549> matter<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
drop the wrench it doesn't matter it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
drop the wrench it doesn't matter it
won't<00:01:18.240> pop<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
won't pop out to get it out you can just

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.980 
won't pop out to get it out you can just
use<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.159> fingernail<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> pull<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.270> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
use your fingernail and pull it out but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
use your fingernail and pull it out but
it<00:01:22.080> locks<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.710> securely<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> when

you go to let's say you're changing a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.649 
you go to let's say you're changing a

tire you don't have to be so concerned
about<00:01:27.960> where<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.409> nut<00:01:28.680> goes<00:01:28.979> ends<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> or

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
about where this nut goes ends up or

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
about where this nut goes ends up or
falls<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.960> could<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> wrench<00:01:31.619> down

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
falls out you could put the wrench down

falls out you could put the wrench down
you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> hold<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.329> hand

stop well with this magnetic wrench

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.430 
stop well with this magnetic wrench
again<00:02:46.950> because<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.330> nut<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.230> gonna

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
again because you know the nut is gonna

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.980 
again because you know the nut is gonna
stay<00:02:49.740> in<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> wrench<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.690> lot

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
stay in the wrench you can do that a lot

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.020 
stay in the wrench you can do that a lot
faster<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.710> with<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> lot<00:02:53.250> more<00:02:53.430> confidence

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
faster and with a lot more confidence

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.610 
faster and with a lot more confidence
than<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> didn't<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.580> magnetic<00:02:57.620> our

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
than if it didn't have that magnetic our

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.460 
than if it didn't have that magnetic our
wrench<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.010> also<00:02:59.340> adjustable<00:02:59.610> if<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.170> like

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
wrench is also adjustable if if I like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.320 
wrench is also adjustable if if I like
it<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> middle<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.790> some<00:03:03.150> guys

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
it in the middle but I know some guys

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330 
it in the middle but I know some guys
like<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.990> have<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> little<00:03:04.260> more<00:03:04.470> leverage<00:03:04.710> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
like to have a little more leverage so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.650 
like to have a little more leverage so
it's<00:03:05.490> basically<00:03:05.880> you're<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.240> taking<00:03:06.360> it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it's basically you're just taking it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.830 
it's basically you're just taking it
from<00:03:06.780> there<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.980> there<00:03:08.540> putting<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.660> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
from there to there putting it in

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
putting the screw in and now I've got a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.590 
putting the screw in and now I've got a
lot<00:03:12.000> more<00:03:12.030> leverage<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:15.090> know<00:03:15.210> really

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
lot more leverage to do you know really

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.590 
lot more leverage to do you know really
