he's flanking him so guys you can learn
from<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.990> flanking<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> always<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> good<00:00:14.670> idea

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
from this flanking is always a good idea

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.210 
from this flanking is always a good idea
i<00:00:15.120> love<00:00:15.690> these<00:00:15.900> hydrofoils<00:00:16.410> they<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.770> such

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
i love these hydrofoils they are such

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830 
i love these hydrofoils they are such
good<00:00:17.430> anterior<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.390> ripping

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
good anterior look at this is ripping

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.040 
good anterior look at this is ripping
apart<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.380> chopper<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.939> range<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.449> amazing

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
apart this chopper the range is amazing

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
apart this chopper the range is amazing
the<00:00:22.320> speed<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> incredible<00:00:23.220> even<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> way<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the speed is incredible even the way it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.259 
the speed is incredible even the way it
turns<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.779> fast<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.500> hydrofoil<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> he's

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
turns is so fast the hydrofoil and he's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
turns is so fast the hydrofoil and he's
only<00:00:27.539> got<00:00:27.900> bullfrogs<00:00:28.410> those<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.890> don't<00:00:29.010> know

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
only got bullfrogs those I don't know

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
only got bullfrogs those I don't know
what<00:00:29.189> happened<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> subs<00:00:30.050> subs<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.289> back

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
what happened to the subs subs are back

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.310 
what happened to the subs subs are back
in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> home<00:00:31.800> base<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> guess<00:00:32.960> he<00:00:33.960> needs<00:00:34.170> those

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
in the home base I guess he needs those

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.990 
in the home base I guess he needs those
subs<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.860> badly<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> he's<00:00:35.460> also<00:00:35.610> doing<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
subs very badly and he's also doing the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
subs very badly and he's also doing the
right<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> mean<00:00:36.360> Matisse<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> playing<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
right I mean Matisse is playing this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.240 
right I mean Matisse is playing this
perfectly<00:00:37.410> he's<00:00:37.770> pulling<00:00:38.040> back<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
perfectly he's pulling back the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
perfectly he's pulling back the
bullfrogs<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> pulling<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> coolest

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
bullfrogs and pulling out the coolest

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.860 
bullfrogs and pulling out the coolest
subs<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.340> hydrofoil<00:00:41.879> has<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.540> has<00:00:42.690> its

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
subs so this hydrofoil has it has its

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
subs so this hydrofoil has it has its
days<00:00:43.110> number<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:43.680> see<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.860> fast<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.219> goes

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
days number let's see how fast it goes

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
days number let's see how fast it goes
down<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.820> always<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.840> assault<00:00:46.050> destroy

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
down I always got an assault destroy

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
down I always got an assault destroy
let's<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.340> fast<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> goes<00:00:47.789> down

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
let's see how fast this goes down

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.700 
let's see how fast this goes down
because<00:00:48.180> these<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.780> subs<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.530> rip

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because these these subs will will rip

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.810 
because these these subs will will rip
apart<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.309> destroyer<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> hydrofoil<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
apart the destroyer and the hydrofoil I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.130 
apart the destroyer and the hydrofoil I
mean<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:54.030> akula<00:00:54.239> subs<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.660> take<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.899> quite

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
mean three akula subs can take out quite

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.510 
mean three akula subs can take out quite
a<00:00:55.170> lot<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.530> he's<00:00:55.890> using<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> special

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
a lot actually he's using a special

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
a lot actually he's using a special
ability<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
ability as we can see and this will do a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
ability as we can see and this will do a
lot<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> damage<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> seaport<00:01:02.750> what

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
lot of damage to the to the seaport what

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
lot of damage to the to the seaport what
happened<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:05.720> unsuccessfully

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

this lexus trying to freeze this akula

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
this lexus trying to freeze this akula
sub<00:01:10.290> didn't<00:01:10.680> happen<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> quiet<00:01:12.330> cooperative

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
sub didn't happen this quiet cooperative

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
freeze these are cooler subs but that's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
freeze these are cooler subs but that's
not<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> much<00:01:16.110> harm

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
not really going to do that much harm

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.820 
not really going to do that much harm
right<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.799> took<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.930> seaport<00:01:19.380> that's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
right now took out is the seaport that's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
right now took out is the seaport that's
pretty<00:01:20.100> big<00:01:20.430> blow<00:01:20.640> actually<00:01:21.150> considering

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
pretty big blow actually considering

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
pretty big blow actually considering
that<00:01:23.720> matey's<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> pretty<00:01:25.590> big<00:01:25.860> Navy

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that matey's has got a pretty big Navy

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.460 
that matey's has got a pretty big Navy
now<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.750> selects<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
now so I don't know if what selects is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.260 
now so I don't know if what selects is
thinking<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:28.979> should<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:30.799> my<00:01:31.799> guess<00:01:32.009> he's

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
thinking he should be my guess he's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
thinking he should be my guess he's
going<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.420> air<00:01:33.630> build<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:34.710> his

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going for air build like that's his

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
going for air build like that's his
thing<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> smart<00:01:36.119> move<00:01:36.240> for

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
thing that's also a smart move for

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
thing that's also a smart move for
allies<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:38.430> needs<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.790> care<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
allies but he needs to take care of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
allies but he needs to take care of
these<00:01:39.299> these<00:01:40.110> units<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.579> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
these these units over here because this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.749 
these these units over here because this
could<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> problem<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:44.130> may<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.369> seem<00:01:44.700> like

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
could be a problem it may not seem like

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
could be a problem it may not seem like
much<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.420> being<00:01:45.780> able<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.140> expand<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
much but not being able to expand on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679

water<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.490> bit<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> problem<00:01:48.329> sometimes

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
water is a bit of a problem sometimes

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.010 
water is a bit of a problem sometimes
it's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> hassle<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's a bit of a hassle so you see you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.389 
it's a bit of a hassle so you see you
again<00:01:52.200> selects<00:01:52.560> has<00:01:52.740> taken<00:01:52.950> over<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.220> random

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
again selects has taken over this random

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
again selects has taken over this random
building<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.509> right<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.750> may<00:01:55.229> seem

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
building which right now may seem

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.469 
building which right now may seem
pointless<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> job<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.240> one

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
pointless like just one job or one

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.389 
pointless like just one job or one
peacekeeper<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.950> later<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.369> like<00:02:00.000> he<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.869> see

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
peacekeeper but later on like he can see

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.969 
peacekeeper but later on like he can see
that<00:02:02.399> matey's<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.930> expanding<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> can

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that matey's is is expanding and you can

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
that matey's is is expanding and you can
counter<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.790> react<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.320> let's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
counter you can react to that so let's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
counter you can react to that so let's
see<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> shop<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.310> pumping<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.700> shoppers<00:02:09.179> now

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
see the shop is pumping out shoppers now

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
see the shop is pumping out shoppers now
so<00:02:09.780> interesting<00:02:10.259> tactics<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.950> care<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
so interesting tactics take care of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
so interesting tactics take care of
these<00:02:11.370> riptides

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
these riptides

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.860 
these riptides
so<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:14.280> riptides<00:02:14.670> are<00:02:14.849> coming<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.299> from<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
so the riptides are coming out from the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.589 
so the riptides are coming out from the
armor<00:02:16.319> facility<00:02:16.890> over<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:17.700> which<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.269> good

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
armor facility over here which is good

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.789 
armor facility over here which is good
but<00:02:19.079> I<00:02:19.909> don't<00:02:20.909> know<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:22.290> doesn't<00:02:22.620> seem

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
but I don't know if I just doesn't seem

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.179 
but I don't know if I just doesn't seem
like<00:02:22.829> enough<00:02:23.870> at<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:24.989> moment<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.799> take<00:02:26.010> care

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
like enough at this moment to take care

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.940 
like enough at this moment to take care
of<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.489> mean<00:02:27.379> these<00:02:28.379> choppers<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.359> these<00:02:30.359> subs

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
of I mean these choppers and these subs

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.970 
of I mean these choppers and these subs
so<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.189> I<00:02:32.370> was<00:02:32.579> Lex<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:33.269> would<00:02:33.810> say<00:02:34.109> okay<00:02:35.090> go<00:02:36.090> for

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
so if I was Lex I would say okay go for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.559 
so if I was Lex I would say okay go for
multan<00:02:37.980> these<00:02:38.129> one<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.790> called<00:02:39.090> multi<00:02:39.389> gunner

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
multan these one is called multi gunner

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.190 
multan these one is called multi gunner
ifvs<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.489> air<00:02:41.489> because<00:02:42.209> air<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.780> freaking

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
ifvs and air because air is so freaking

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
ifvs and air because air is so freaking
good<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.250> he's<00:02:44.430> built<00:02:44.609> his<00:02:44.700> rebuilt<00:02:45.180> his

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
good and he's built his rebuilt his

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.059 
good and he's built his rebuilt his
seaport<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.379> would<00:02:46.560> really<00:02:46.769> try<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
seaport but I would really try and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.679 
seaport but I would really try and
defend<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.519> from<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.939> coolest<00:02:48.269> subs<00:02:48.450> again

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
defend this from the coolest subs again

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.780 
defend this from the coolest subs again
because<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.920> see<00:02:50.129> he's<00:02:50.340> coming<00:02:50.669> back

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
because you can see he's coming back

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.750 
because you can see he's coming back
again<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.299> mean<00:02:51.540> come<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:51.870> he<00:02:52.709> needs<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.220> either

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
again I mean come on he needs to either

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.210 
again I mean come on he needs to either
build<00:02:54.269> some<00:02:54.419> indicators<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.079> bomb<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.889> subs

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
build some indicators and bomb the subs

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.649 
build some indicators and bomb the subs
which<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.489> would<00:02:56.639> not<00:02:56.819> recommend<00:02:56.970> by<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.480> way

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
which I would not recommend by the way

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.649 
which I would not recommend by the way
because<00:02:57.840> bombing<00:02:58.319> subs<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.340> difficult<00:02:59.659> if

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
because bombing subs is so difficult if

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.149 
because bombing subs is so difficult if
to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.870> good<00:03:00.989> at<00:03:01.079> my<00:03:01.230> crowing<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.859> they<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.069> go

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
to be good at my crowing and they can go

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.740 
to be good at my crowing and they can go
back<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.519> water<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.849> can<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.030> anything<00:03:03.209> so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
back in the water you can do anything so

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.640 
back in the water you can do anything so
ideally<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.239> build<00:03:06.629> some<00:03:06.989> like

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
ideally he would have to build some like

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 
ideally he would have to build some like
lots<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.250> rip<00:03:08.459> tides<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:09.090> base<00:03:09.510> defense

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
lots of rip tides or base defense

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.720 
lots of rip tides or base defense
because<00:03:10.620> allies<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.189> pretty<00:03:11.400> good<00:03:11.519> base

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
because allies have pretty good base

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.009 
because allies have pretty good base
defense<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.239> we<00:03:12.329> go<00:03:12.419> again<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:12.900> see

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
defense here we go again you can see

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.500 
defense here we go again you can see
this<00:03:13.109> getting<00:03:13.230> ripped<00:03:13.590> apart<00:03:13.739> again<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:15.209> sad

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
this getting ripped apart again it's sad

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.439 
this getting ripped apart again it's sad
man<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.560> nice<00:03:16.829> try<00:03:17.040> slick<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.209> sad

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
man it's nice try slick but this is sad

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.479 
man it's nice try slick but this is sad
like<00:03:20.629> like<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:22.079> cheap<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.859> destroyer<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
like like so cheap and that destroyer is

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.520 
like like so cheap and that destroyer is
going<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.699> get<00:03:23.790> screwed<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.299> well<00:03:24.530> can't

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
going to get screwed as well can't

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.270 
going to get screwed as well can't
really<00:03:25.739> do<00:03:25.859> much<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:27.409> mean<00:03:28.409> it's<00:03:29.040> barely

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
really do much I mean it's barely

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.559 
really do much I mean it's barely
damaged<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.150> subs<00:03:32.299> croppers<00:03:33.299> are<00:03:33.389> doing

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
damaged the subs croppers are doing

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.000 
damaged the subs croppers are doing
their<00:03:33.690> job<00:03:33.959> but<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.680> there's<00:03:34.889> no

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
their job but it's just there's no

their job but it's just there's no
there's<00:03:35.280> no<00:03:35.310> air<00:03:35.549> support<00:03:35.729> I<00:03:36.060> mean<00:03:36.180> where<00:03:36.329> are

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
there's no air support I mean where are

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.030 
there's no air support I mean where are
the<00:03:36.659> vindicator<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.440> what<00:03:37.620> I'm<00:03:37.739> thinking

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
the vindicator it's what I'm thinking

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.039 
the vindicator it's what I'm thinking
they've<00:03:38.849> all<00:03:38.940> been<00:03:39.060> shot<00:03:39.329> down<00:03:39.510> by<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.810> mix

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
they've all been shot down by the mix

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.649 
they've all been shot down by the mix
but<00:03:40.229> he<00:03:40.349> needs<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> rebuild<00:03:40.889> them<00:03:41.069> then<00:03:41.659> he

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
but he needs to rebuild them then he

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.939

is it the gym is this one that has the
jammer<00:05:22.960> yeah<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.520> hydrofoil<00:05:24.970> has<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> jammer

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
jammer yeah the hydrofoil has a jammer

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.980 
jammer yeah the hydrofoil has a jammer
so<00:05:27.760> he<00:05:27.850> could<00:05:28.060> use<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.330> jammer<00:05:28.570> on<00:05:28.810> the

the<00:05:37.540> risk<00:05:37.750> it's<00:05:38.020> not<00:05:38.170> that<00:05:38.380> big<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.620> gamble<00:05:39.330> you

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
the risk it's not that big a gamble you

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.300 
the risk it's not that big a gamble you
can<00:05:40.450> see<00:05:40.600> his<00:05:40.690> legs<00:05:40.870> avoided<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.680> Akula<00:05:42.070> sub

special torpedo attack nicely done here
we<00:05:44.500> go<00:05:44.620> as<00:05:44.680> he's<00:05:44.830> jamming<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.280> nicely<00:05:45.790> done<00:05:45.910> and

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
we go as he's jamming it nicely done and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.940 
we go as he's jamming it nicely done and
he's<00:05:46.390> frozen<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.840> which<00:05:47.170> is<00:05:47.290> it<00:05:47.380> I<00:05:47.590> don't<00:05:47.890> know

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
he's frozen it which is it I don't know

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.970 
he's frozen it which is it I don't know
like<00:05:48.730> it<00:05:49.510> loses<00:05:50.170> armor<00:05:50.440> but<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:50.650> also<00:05:50.770> goes

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
like it loses armor but it also goes

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.470 
like it loses armor but it also goes
faster<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.490> sometimes<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.910> feel<00:05:52.120> like<00:05:52.240> it's<00:05:52.450> not

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
faster so sometimes I feel like it's not

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.700 
faster so sometimes I feel like it's not

counter with those little rip tides

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.559 
counter with those little rip tides
because<00:06:34.210> rip<00:06:34.360> tides<00:06:34.600> are

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569

for<00:06:38.899> sure<00:06:39.020> and<00:06:39.259> he<00:06:39.289> needs<00:06:40.099> to<00:06:40.219> build<00:06:40.399> some<00:06:40.789> jabs

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
for sure and he needs to build some jabs

or some like friggin air comes to me to

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.929 
or some like friggin air comes to me to
see<00:06:45.709> how<00:06:45.800> they'd<00:06:46.039> make<00:06:46.069> this<00:06:46.399> build<00:06:46.669> and<00:06:46.789> go

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
see how they'd make this build and go

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:52.329 
see how they'd make this build and go
that<00:06:47.149> boom<00:06:50.409> pop<00:06:51.409> goes<00:06:51.619> the<00:06:51.649> building<00:06:52.099> and

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339 
that boom pop goes the building and

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:54.760 
that boom pop goes the building and
outcomes<00:06:53.059> peacekeeper<00:06:53.539> in<00:06:53.629> two<00:06:53.719> seconds<00:06:54.080> but

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
outcomes peacekeeper in two seconds but

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.929 
outcomes peacekeeper in two seconds but
if<00:06:55.339> I<00:06:55.610> was<00:06:56.800> doozy<00:06:57.800> here<00:06:57.949> I<00:06:58.129> would<00:06:58.399> fought<00:06:58.669> stop

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
if I was doozy here I would fought stop

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.760 
if I was doozy here I would fought stop
building<00:06:59.179> those<00:06:59.479> rip<00:06:59.959> tides<00:07:00.169> and<00:07:00.469> start

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
building those rip tides and start

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.669 
building those rip tides and start
building<00:07:00.889> some<00:07:02.169> well<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.289> I'll<00:07:03.349> just<00:07:03.409> stars

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:03.679 
building some well so I'll just stars

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:06.100 
building some well so I'll just stars
not<00:07:03.830> bad<00:07:04.039> but<00:07:04.339> like<00:07:04.789> friggin<00:07:05.449> tanks<00:07:05.869> and<00:07:06.020> here

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
not bad but like friggin tanks and here

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.480 
not bad but like friggin tanks and here
comes<00:07:06.289> the<00:07:06.439> first<00:07:06.559> Guardian<00:07:07.039> tank<00:07:07.219> I<00:07:07.309> guess

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
comes the first Guardian tank I guess

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.179 
comes the first Guardian tank I guess
which<00:07:08.059> is<00:07:08.089> he's<00:07:08.959> doing<00:07:09.229> well<00:07:09.409> he's<00:07:09.830> doing<00:07:10.039> well

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:10.189 
which is he's doing well he's doing well

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.649 
which is he's doing well he's doing well
still<00:07:11.029> be<00:07:11.089> what<00:07:11.209> I'm<00:07:11.300> saying<00:07:12.759> because<00:07:13.759> I<00:07:14.089> think

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
still be what I'm saying because I think

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.430 
still be what I'm saying because I think
he<00:07:14.719> I<00:07:14.869> mean<00:07:14.930> he<00:07:15.289> could<00:07:15.529> see<00:07:15.740> these<00:07:15.919> I<00:07:16.129> mean
