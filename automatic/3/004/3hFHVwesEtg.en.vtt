ingredients take a pinch of salt you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
ingredients take a pinch of salt you
don't<00:01:15.600> need<00:01:15.869> much<00:01:16.400> get<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.790> your

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
don't need much get it right on your

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.190 
don't need much get it right on your
tongue<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.450> were<00:01:18.540> doing<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> shot<00:01:19.080> at

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.140 
tongue as if you were doing a shot at
tequila<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.520> let<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.270> crystals<00:01:21.720> dissolve

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
tequila and let those crystals dissolve

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.249 
tequila and let those crystals dissolve
once<00:01:24.150> they're<00:01:24.360> gone<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.170> take

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
once they're gone go back and take

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
once they're gone go back and take
another<00:01:25.560> sip<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> first<00:01:26.369> wine<00:01:26.610> our

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
another sip of the first wine our

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.980 
another sip of the first wine our
Sauvignon<00:01:27.479> Blanc<00:01:31.369> it's<00:01:32.689> noticeable<00:01:33.689> right

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Sauvignon Blanc it's noticeable right

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.109 
Sauvignon Blanc it's noticeable right
away<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> wine<00:01:35.009> seems<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.700> less

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
away that the wine seems a lot less

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.219 
away that the wine seems a lot less
acidic<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> did<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.920> first<00:01:38.310> sip<00:01:38.520> why

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
acidic now than it did on first sip why

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.920 
acidic now than it did on first sip why
because<00:01:40.229> salt<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.979> acidity<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.420> both

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because salt and acidity are both

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.170 
because salt and acidity are both
perceptions<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.759> through<00:01:45.030> our

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
perceptions that we get through our

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
perceptions that we get through our
taste<00:01:45.540> buds<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.680> compete<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.549> one

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
taste buds but they compete with one

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
taste buds but they compete with one
another<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.210> can't<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.540> perceived<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.140> the

another they can't be perceived at the
same<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.850> important<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
same time and this is very important to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
same time and this is very important to
remember<00:01:51.720> because<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> vast<00:01:52.649> majority<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
remember because the vast majority of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
remember because the vast majority of
the<00:01:53.520> foods<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.090> eat<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.509> seasoned<00:01:55.020> with

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the foods that we eat are seasoned with

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
the foods that we eat are seasoned with
salt<00:01:55.470> quite<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> salt<00:01:56.850> sometimes<00:01:57.180> and

salt quite a lot of salt sometimes and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.440 
salt quite a lot of salt sometimes and
salt<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.890> dramatic<00:01:59.520> noticeable<00:02:00.119> effect

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
salt has this dramatic noticeable effect
