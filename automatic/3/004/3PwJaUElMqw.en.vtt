00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.379
 the person's galley had a bulletin 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.170
 Quick on the Malaysian GP because 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.120
 next week already has the proof of the marim and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.440
 The Malaysian GP was not one of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 exciting, it turned out to be a bit 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
 predictable there without rain then the defendant 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 shot ahead took the test by doing 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 Mclaren's Double Doubt 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 mercedes or is the clear subject to people 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.490
 always think treating her with rosberg in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.410
 in mercedes 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.170
 the red bull band of well plus the subject 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.540
 that we will comment here is clear the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 Felipe Masses team history 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 with walter boots 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 I think the problem gives you Williams. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 already a certain disappointment of the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.800
 performance of a car that spoke so much 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 the preseason is a lot of people putting 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.149
 as a favorite to win races 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.879
 and now at least the second step does not 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.090
 shows much more than it killed the bone is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.309
 a car there that they have hardly 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.670
 that depending on drop - outs enter 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 points at least in the first steps 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.619
 even in Australia up to a little better with 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 mouths but we face the mass now in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 Malaysia if it were not for the problems 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 magnussen from adu hit and ray cooney 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.380
 I think they would hardly have 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 scored points 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.159
 then the question of team order or 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.280
 does not end up being a little smaller 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.470
 No, because what really happens here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 in car does not match 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.759
 and there it is by 7ยบ 8ยบ and it is really 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.490
 I agree with a lot of people bet 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.540
 It's kinda embarrassing is the term used 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 a little 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.130
 or is it for everything that happened to you? 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.000
 talk to the radio from the mass boots rate 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.890
 ion and I think Felipe finished 16 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 rebel or not I do not know what the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 The consequences of this he imposed with the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 pilot and he is the product and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.689
 much more famous with much more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.759
 story what boots 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 then he has the right to do this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.180
 with the foot when because the time I 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.250
 Can I be in front of him? 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.540
 It will not do the opposite - that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.090
 he walks faster then 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.209
 so I put my question there 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.000
 and ended up making a lot of fanfare over 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.459
 a situation that is race but the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.950
 The bigger problem is that the car is not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.569
 It is as good as they expected 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.000
 minimized talking at home to people 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.900
 scored more points than in the past but 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.480
 zero for 341 does not change much 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 then this is as by appearance - 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 react and I think that the mass always has to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.790
 to impose on the runway has more tail 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.260
 boots 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.720
 I think that the whole legitimate proof 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
 situation in which the boots showed 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 pace of walking was at the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.690
 front of the pasta was not so we stayed 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.989
 in the bar enter disco is of course I think 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.370
 that there opinion as a fico fan is who 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.019
 attends formula 1 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 this is the marketing will let pass the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.060
 criticism would be too heavy so I 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.340
 that this turned out right and now 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.560
 Let's see what happens at the bar. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.329
 next week night test promises to be 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.329
 Well cool, better than this one from Malaysia. 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.599
 This is until next week 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.599
 bye
