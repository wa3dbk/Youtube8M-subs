00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 present and ps vita console 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.799
 in any case its unpacking because I 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.429
 do not have an area where I know myself 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.860
 a lot i'm more on the iphone side 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.550
 apple and all that so today I 'm 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.910
 I bought the ps vita to be able 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.820
 play a bit out of my house so here 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.439
 I bought the pack the frozen fifty well 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.600
 I obviously never unpacked and saw 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.710
 that I still have a way of security 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 So here is a price of 239 euros a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.780
 price I do not find very low very low 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 but still still pretty high but 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.449
 good I hope the console on good in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.449
 Worth it I will immediately cut 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.449
 right here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.750
 also taken with the game littlebigplanet 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.680
 who looked really nice so I 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.530
 su saw that there was not much 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.729
 of hours of play but I was holding when 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.790
 even to take this game that gave me 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.470
 want for a long time 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.110
 on the other consoles but that I 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.229
 never had the opportunity to 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:35.020
 test well test yes but never played 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:38.920
 really so there we end up with the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:47.399
 box of the ps vita normally still 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 a small tab indicated here is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.130
 so let's see what's in there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 very nice box your little one your 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.679
 big really a nice box 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.440
 so let's see what's inside 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.480
 so then we come right here 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.200
 so I discover exactly the same 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.650
 time you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.400
 I never unpacked console arm 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.920
 before I even had document 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.360
 intend to buy it but these 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.070
 lately I have heard some good 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.519
 so I thought why not 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.459
 buy it so here I have just removed 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.579
 several implementation guide manuals 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:43.060
 road in summer it's better to do that 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.620
 so obviously obviously available in 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.940
 four different languages 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.940
 so here we delivered 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.490
 on the safety guide and a tricks 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.650
 little useless for us anyway for 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.520
 I do Has not great 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.520
 importance 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.640
 we continue true here playstation 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.720
 small advertising network to join the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.160
 playstation network 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 so here a famous scratch card 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.500
 with the call of duty game that I can 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.580
 now download on the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.510
 playstation network 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.310
 cissÃ© has not changed his name yet 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.550
 I had heard that there were different 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.310
 changes at home so here what is this 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.370
 we have a nice little booklet 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.750
 so at r station more and see me I do not 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:47.860
 do not even know that there was 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:52.180
 cards so there seems there to a 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.940
 two in the box so reality 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.480
 augmented it's a game I had received 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:04.980
 need the same thing at home nintendo 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 for the 3d is 6th 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.980
 then what do we have other 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.430
 that's a little everything that is pope 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.970
 race and all that then 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:31.900
 here we have in the usb cable for 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.530
 plug in the console show a little 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:45.460
 special always unique 1 I just 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:46.330
 sean that it must be to load it here 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.130
 Oh yes okay 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.610
 yeah so I see it's a new 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.260
 usb charging system so the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.070
 horses you can console to load 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.910
 more than usb here where we see a 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.910
 usb input 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.169
 I would be curious to see if it's 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.419
 3.0 of 2.0 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:12.520
 my opinion it's still 2.0 mallard a 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.900
 4 gigabyte memory card so like 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:21.190
 inscribed on the rooster who who costs in 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.260
 store 19 euros 99 and that the poc costs 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.320
 only 40 euros more we have the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.470
 game and a black card so for all 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.380
 those who would like to buy a console 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.400
 ps vita I really recommend the pack 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.340
 which is much cheaper 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.510
 we are here is there a little trick 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.670
 for way 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.430
 that then the famous console 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.490
 I'm happy with higuain facebook and 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:58.660
 twitter here more psp but ps vita 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:06:00.510
 before I was super sbb and me so I 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.050
 the sister of her packaging 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:10.450
 she's pretty bright 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:13.120
 I really do not read too much 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.860
 of loan for not that you excuse me I 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.950
 ran out of place on my 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:24.670
 SD card so I was the console here 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:27.960
 a beautiful one very bright like that at cbs 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:34.570
 but not at all bothered jack 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:37.660
 input the back which is very tactile 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.930
 Roman good console that's really 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.840
 really before the famous 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.910
 joystick my opinion for traces of 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.760
 fingers I can not do anything since I'm going 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.680
 have to play with the touch that are 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.130
 fingerprints that's going to be some 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.170
 thing to the ignition button wii six 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.000
 volumes I discovered exactly at the same 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.640
 time you me I have never looked at the 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.750
 console on the internet than before 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.030
 so I'm fully in a stage that 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:11.320
 you sipa you may have even 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.940
 more informed than me so or who is 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.590
 small entrance for a tiny 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.870
 map 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.150
 finally here that's so I think I'm going 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.950
 stop here there is nothing more 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.930
 really to show 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.680
 I showed the console inside the 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.210
 box so here I am going to stop there 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.510
 I hope this little video you 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.760
 I will like to make videos of 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.380
 unpacking the really first here 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.050
 you saw I took off the strips 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.200
 from the store so I really never 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.300
 unpacked the console here I hope that 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.120
 this video will have pleased you i 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.940
 1 / I like it would make me really 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.460
 pleasure and maybe in a video 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.949
 future for the littlebigplanet test or 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.250
