00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.450> it's<00:00:00.630> finally<00:00:00.900> safe<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.589> say<00:00:01.770> that<00:00:01.800> we

I think it's finally safe to say that we

piece verse 11 talk about a specific
scene<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.349> particular<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:11.759> law<00:00:12.059> and

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
scene in particular it was with law and

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.509 
scene in particular it was with law and
Virgo<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.049> burn<00:00:13.530> girls<00:00:13.769> there<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.250> on

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
Virgo and burn girls there you know on

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.730 
Virgo and burn girls there you know on
the<00:00:14.639> floor<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.809> added<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.379> filler

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the floor and they added in a filler

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
the floor and they added in a filler
scene<00:00:17.100> which<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.609> definitely<00:00:17.910> say<00:00:18.210> again<00:00:18.449> they

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
scene which I definitely say again they

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
scene which I definitely say again they
did<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.050> remember<00:00:19.470> Fishman<00:00:19.890> Island<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
did this I remember Fishman Island and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820 
did this I remember Fishman Island and
it<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.660> unnecessary<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
it was just really unnecessary and it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
it was just really unnecessary and it
just<00:00:22.980> kind<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> slightly<00:00:23.820> takes<00:00:24.269> away<00:00:24.600> from

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
just kind of slightly takes away from

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
just kind of slightly takes away from
the<00:00:24.930> impact<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> prior<00:00:26.130> episode<00:00:26.670> because

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the impact of the prior episode because

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.640 
the impact of the prior episode because
in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> prior<00:00:27.660> episode<00:00:28.109> he<00:00:28.170> cuts<00:00:28.410> him<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.590> half

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
in the prior episode he cuts him in half

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
in the prior episode he cuts him in half
and<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> manga<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> said<00:00:30.060> he's<00:00:30.179> cut<00:00:30.390> in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and in the manga that I said he's cut in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.150 
and in the manga that I said he's cut in
half<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> next<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:31.980> her

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
half and then the next time we see her

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
half and then the next time we see her
go<00:00:32.369> he's<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.820> ahead<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> rails

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
go he's just ahead there on the rails

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.229 
go he's just ahead there on the rails
and<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> episode<00:00:36.120> they

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and that's it but with this episode they

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.510 
and that's it but with this episode they
put<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.559> fries<00:00:38.250> at

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
put it that it was like on some fries at

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
put it that it was like on some fries at
vs<00:00:39.210> goku<00:00:39.420> type<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.170> he's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> half

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
vs goku type of where he's a half

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
vs goku type of where he's a half
by<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.340> tries<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> lunge<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.450> law<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
by then and tries to lunge at law and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.209 
by then and tries to lunge at law and
that's<00:00:43.320> probably<00:00:43.440> where<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that's probably where they got the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
that's probably where they got the
inspiration<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.329> fill<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> bit

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
inspiration to do that little fill a bit

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
inspiration to do that little fill a bit
but<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.530> wasn't<00:00:46.829> necessarily<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.430> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
but it wasn't necessarily and I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.650 
but it wasn't necessarily and I
definitely<00:00:47.730> feel<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> took<00:00:48.270> away<00:00:48.480> from

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
definitely feel like it took away from

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.770 
definitely feel like it took away from
the<00:00:48.750> impact<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.350> last<00:00:49.829> week's<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.370> just

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
the impact of last week's you know just

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
the impact of last week's you know just
demolishing<00:00:51.780> attack<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.620> law<00:00:52.860> did<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.309> Virgo

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
demolishing attack that law did on Virgo

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.819 
demolishing attack that law did on Virgo
so<00:00:54.210> definitely<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.680> was

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so definitely I don't know what was

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319 
so definitely I don't know what was
their<00:00:55.980> mind<00:00:56.190> frame<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> add

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
their mind frame on that was just to add

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
their mind frame on that was just to add
more<00:00:57.899> time<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.160> give<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
more time to make it like give it I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
more time to make it like give it I
don't<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:01.079> oomph<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.829> something<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
don't know more oomph or something I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't know more oomph or something I
don't<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.670> were<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:02.850> going

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
don't know what they were really going

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.609 
don't know what they were really going
for<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.420> definitely<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> feel<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.080> though<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
for but definitely I feel as though that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
for but definitely I feel as though that
wasn't<00:01:04.860> needed<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:06.000> did<00:01:06.180> add<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
wasn't needed are they did add of the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
wasn't needed are they did add of the
rest<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> bits<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
rest of the bits with you know them to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
rest of the bits with you know them to
him<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.670> how<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:08.880> cuts<00:01:09.210> his<00:01:09.420> head<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
him what not how he cuts his head in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
him what not how he cuts his head in
half<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.040> vicious<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
half so that was some vicious but I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
half so that was some vicious but I
was<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.600> wondering<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> hell<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
was just wondering what the hell was

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
was just wondering what the hell was
their<00:01:13.799> mind<00:01:14.070> frame<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
their mind frame when they get that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
their mind frame when they get that
having<00:01:15.630> Virgo<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.799> time<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
having Virgo get up one more time and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
having Virgo get up one more time and
jump<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> him<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.180> wasn't<00:01:18.900> really

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
jump on him like it wasn't really

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
jump on him like it wasn't really
necessary<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.310> off<00:01:20.520> camera

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
necessary and then it was off camera

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
necessary and then it was off camera
handled<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.540> least<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> got<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
handled at least have you got to do that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
handled at least have you got to do that
have<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.220> cam<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.180> law<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
have it on cam where you know law just

got to say that but they added a lot of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
got to say that but they added a lot of
those<00:01:47.280> bits<00:01:47.549> once<00:01:47.759> again<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> kids

saying i can't run anymore and that
feels<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> guess<00:01:51.149> ready<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> running<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
feels like I guess ready a running a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
feels like I guess ready a running a
problem<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.189> arc<00:01:53.430> overall<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
problem with this arc overall so you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490 
problem with this arc overall so you
know<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.450> nothing<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.380> this

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and again that's pretty much par for the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.229 
and again that's pretty much par for the
core<00:02:28.590> par<00:02:29.219> for<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> course<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.909> piece<00:02:30.090> at

core par for the course for one piece at

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.670 
core par for the course for one piece at
this<00:02:30.389> point<00:02:30.659> so<00:02:30.840> nothing<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.349> could<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.650> about

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
this point so nothing you could do about

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740 
this point so nothing you could do about
that<00:02:31.889> as<00:02:32.129> well<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.760> unless<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.269> was<00:02:33.389> probably

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.149 
know looking tremendously crazy and then
luffy<00:02:57.540> comes<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.260> definitely<00:02:58.680> reminded<00:02:59.069> me

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
luffy comes that definitely reminded me

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.679 
luffy comes that definitely reminded me
of<00:02:59.189> that<00:02:59.340> battle<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.090> overall<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.419> feel<00:03:00.569> like

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
of that battle but overall I feel like

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.629 
of that battle but overall I feel like
it<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.959> pretty<00:03:01.139> good<00:03:01.230> episode<00:03:01.469> it<00:03:02.010> wasn't

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
it was a pretty good episode it wasn't

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.399 
it was a pretty good episode it wasn't
nowhere<00:03:02.790> near<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.269> climactic<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.019> last<00:03:04.230> week's

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
nowhere near as climactic as last week's

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.530 
nowhere near as climactic as last week's
episode<00:03:04.500> indefinitely<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.519> felt<00:03:06.060> like<00:03:06.269> had

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
episode indefinitely I felt like had

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.629 
episode indefinitely I felt like had
some<00:03:06.840> setbacks<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.739> mainly<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.579> the

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
some setbacks to it mainly one of the

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.220 
some setbacks to it mainly one of the
big<00:03:08.790> things<00:03:08.909> is<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.510> takes<00:03:09.870> away<00:03:10.169> from

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
big things is like it takes away from

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.679 
big things is like it takes away from
the<00:03:10.439> epicness<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:11.069> laws<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.669> strike<00:03:12.150> when<00:03:12.599> you

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
the epicness of laws one strike when you

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.780 
the epicness of laws one strike when you
