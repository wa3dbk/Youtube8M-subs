00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very good guys how are you and flow 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 street and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 call of duty black ops 3 in which you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 I show the water map in attack me 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.580
 It reminds a lot of ride but obviously 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.200
 has the water thing that really if not what 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 you want to use a lot because I do not think 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.289
 you need to use it shortens 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 quite at the time of going to a point to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.770
 another but good is not necessary as 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.869
 we visited in a hard point game 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 hot knit and the truth that they are 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 Pretty cool game which I already tell you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 we were playing tolete myself because these 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 clips are mixed and the truth is that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.630
 It's pretty web like I say 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.910
 we use water especially for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.350
 hide or to try that we 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.059
 finish killing when we are very 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620
 annoyed with life but never for 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.480
 go from one point to another and the truth that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 what according to what they told us there in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 activision is basically for what 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 is something to hide for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 let's say you have no problems when 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.030
 you are about to die but very little 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.260
 times to transport yourself from a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 point to another because you're always 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 sold when you are leaving or entering 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 of the water because it goes rather slower than 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 normal but good guys to the case like 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.239
 this is a pretty short video but 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.590
 I also wanted to show you what the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 map itself and the map as it does not have so 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 little so much is super tiny and added 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 that reminds me a lot root and well a 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.939
 truth is also that we change in the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.160
 specialist and we go with the specialist 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.330
 what are you doing? 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.800
 gravitatorias that you will see later that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 we use them and the truth that a 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.560
 quite catastrophic result still 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.630
 we do not know very well how they are used 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 but in theory when you use them not 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.280
 You must die, the fact is that I do not know 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.590
 how it happened and when we use them we die 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.580
 that is not the problem but here as 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.900
 you see we are in hot point what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.730
 we use to hide a little bit 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.810
 to see if people came and catch them anything 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.160
 more enter the hot spot but not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.260
 nobody came but basically it was for what 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.790
 that was used that let's say that that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.530
 mini pool was outside 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.300
 apart also evident from changing 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.680
 area but good as you see here too 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.150
 we use to hide at the time of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 that will kill us and continue 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 then try to kill them let's say when 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.920
 they were at the hot spot that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.420
 I was in here as you are seeing 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 that's what I wanted to tell you guys 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 which is also used more than anything to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 the topic of hiding and so good 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.050
 true that obviously also 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.460
 use it to humble a point to another 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.080
 but it's much better to start with the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 water how to do watching here walk the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.470
 wall and then fall here live and kill 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 everyone is much faster and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.050
 comfortable although you also have to have in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 mind that walking with the wall is not so 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.530
 easy as it seems that is to say you have to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.119
 have your little bit of practice 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 to see is not the most complicated case of the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.000
 world but you have to have a little bit of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.020
 practice for as you see we are going to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.700
 use the banderillas these 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.170
 anti-gravitational jazz and the result is 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.100
 that we died and I just realized 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.990
 because that's why 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.540
 the car next door but in theory not 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.850
 has to die has an area of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.240
 pretty big enough damage let's say 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500
 which is tense scored when you use has 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.150
 with special an expansive which 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.770
 you can do everything you have 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.180
 around but good guys as you see 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.590
 this is the cave that is inside where 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.050
 is the waterfall you can also access 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.160
 by the water or walking as you already know 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.840
 I said that I am not very supportive of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.340
 water because you go much slower and you 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.170
 you are a little more sold at the mercy of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.550
 the enemies although although I say that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.050
 can be used to catch people by 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 the back and such but many diegos 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.170
 much better to use not only in 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.670
 extreme cases to hide or things 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 like that anyway we are 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.700
 now using submachine this the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.580
 it's really good, it reminds me of the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.800
 mp5 also called k efe 5 on the in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 age more so good to we change to 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.190
 This rifle is also very cool 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.420
 it kills pretty fast is also saying 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.190
 that a good fast train and we 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.540
 we die so fast too because never 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.920
 online game is to say you know that the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.450
 connection in this game for a long time 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.640
 but some game talk then 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.970
 obviously, it kills and moves 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.650
 much faster because it has hardly been 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.880
 possible anyway that of guys or 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.590
 be here we are going to throw a pack of 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.730
 help that the truth touched us an rc of 15 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.050
 of the new ones that we never got to 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.160
 use because we ran out of the game 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.070
 right away because 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.030
 sauce out at once counts very little 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.340
 I think the video will last about four 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.260
 minutes approximately no more and it's because 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.700
 the subject of that they are super short 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.960
 the games and they did not want 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.830
 sell us another different map only 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.630
 I wanted to make a video with this map 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.970
 because the truth that I find very very 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.500
 very good maps we do not know will be me 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.600
 like a still one but this map is 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.980
 the most dynamic and explosive until the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.210
 moment shown to me at least 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.010
 What I liked the most was this map 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.930
 then the boys and I tell you that is 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.640
 it's very cool the game is very very very 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.130
 dynamic the theme of the jump is super 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.200
 Currado does not have sitting as you are already 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.550
 seeing so nothing just wanted 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.930
 comment or is it a little bit the map 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.100
 to say it is more or less also a couple 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.900
 of new things that good 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.460
 medium functionality already giving account 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.750
 commented on the video so nothing 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.400
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.840
 video it feels like you leave a big like 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.890
 in this is how we see in the next 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.690
 subscribe to channel if you are not 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.410
 share this video with two friends and 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.410
 goodbye
