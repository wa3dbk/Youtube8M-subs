a 3x3 in total I'm gonna take a guess
here<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.009> honestly<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.990> gonna

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
here I honestly don't know but I'm gonna

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
here I honestly don't know but I'm gonna
think<00:01:49.680> somewhere<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> ballpark<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
think somewhere in the ballpark of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.620 
think somewhere in the ballpark of
around<00:01:51.680> 40,000<00:01:52.680> solves<00:01:53.130> Kevin<00:01:53.850> tang<00:01:54.119> when<00:01:54.540> do

around 40,000 solves Kevin tang when do

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.030 
around 40,000 solves Kevin tang when do
you<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:54.810> Felix<00:01:55.200> will<00:01:55.350> break<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> single

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

cuber what do you think about
speedcubing<00:02:22.260> limits<00:02:22.680> well<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> think<00:02:23.430> we're

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
speedcubing limits well I think we're

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.520 
speedcubing limits well I think we're
getting<00:02:23.940> close<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.599> far<00:02:24.780> as<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> referee

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
getting close as far as the referee

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.660 
getting close as far as the referee
considering<00:02:26.370> Felix's<00:02:26.940> PB<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:28.519> 3.7<00:02:29.519> or

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
considering Felix's PB is like 3.7 or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850 
considering Felix's PB is like 3.7 or
something<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.380> could<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.709> that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
something and so if you could get that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
something and so if you could get that
in<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.160> competition<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.970> don't<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:33.569> we'd<00:02:33.750> be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
in a competition I don't think we'd be

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
in a competition I don't think we'd be

month<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.959> was<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.319> pretty<00:03:01.560> good<00:03:01.769> average

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
month so that was a pretty good average

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.539 
month so that was a pretty good average
is<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.310> 14<00:03:02.790> point<00:03:03.030> 2<00:03:03.209> 3<00:03:03.390> average<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> 5<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:05.010> am

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
is the 14 point 2 3 average of 5 I am

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.250 
is the 14 point 2 3 average of 5 I am
really<00:03:05.880> liking<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.330> averages<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.959> cube<00:03:07.170> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
really liking the averages this cube is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.820 
really liking the averages this cube is
giving<00:03:07.530> me

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
giving me

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
giving me
it's<00:03:08.099> very<00:03:08.310> controllable<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.060> me<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> like

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
it's very controllable for me and I like

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.150 
it's very controllable for me and I like
the<00:03:09.750> speed<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.500> let's<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.739> go<00:03:10.860> ahead<00:03:10.920> and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the speed so let's just go ahead and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.600 
the speed so let's just go ahead and
move<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.849> our<00:03:11.880> challenge<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.370> one's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
move on to our challenge so this one's

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.190 
move on to our challenge so this one's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.670 
by 2 and a pyraminx
one-handed<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.079> he<00:03:22.079> didn't<00:03:22.320> give<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.470> any

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
one-handed and he didn't give me any

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.430 
one-handed and he didn't give me any
scrambles<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.670> we're<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.329> going<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.840> use

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
scrambles so we're just going to use

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.309 
scrambles so we're just going to use
some<00:03:25.799> generated<00:03:26.519> ones<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.079> bit

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
some generated ones so it's a little bit

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.979 
some generated ones so it's a little bit
generated<00:03:28.769> 2x2<00:03:29.069> scramble

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:43.780 

and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.650> do<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:36.140> pair<00:03:37.140> makes<00:03:37.319> 1

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.000 

so<00:03:47.270> there<00:03:48.270> we<00:03:48.390> go

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
so there we go

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.600 
so there we go
all<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.440> let's<00:03:52.440> see<00:03:52.710> my<00:03:53.010> new<00:03:53.160> pair<00:03:53.370> makes

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
all right so let's see my new pair makes

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.320 
all right so let's see my new pair makes
first<00:03:55.400> I'm<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:56.610> good<00:03:56.790> at<00:03:56.880> these<00:03:56.970> one<00:03:57.150> at<00:03:57.300> a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
first I'm not good at these one at a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.840 
first I'm not good at these one at a
challenges<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.670> let's<00:03:59.670> see<00:04:00.270> how<00:04:00.420> we<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.780> oh

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
challenges so let's see how we do oh

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:32.900 
challenges so let's see how we do oh
yeah<00:04:02.880> inspection<00:04:04.790> okay

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.029 

so<00:04:33.960> 143<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:36.130> bad<00:04:36.810> although<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.320> did<00:04:38.560> not<00:04:38.710> win

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
so 143 not bad although I did not win

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.420 
so 143 not bad although I did not win
that<00:04:39.070> he<00:04:39.580> got<00:04:40.110> 133<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.139> think<00:04:41.500> yeah<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.190> got<00:04:42.400> a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
that he got 133 I think yeah you got a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.189 
that he got 133 I think yeah you got a
133<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:44.160> he<00:04:45.160> won<00:04:45.400> by<00:04:45.759> about<00:04:45.940> 10<00:04:46.240> seconds<00:04:46.660> but

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
133 so he won by about 10 seconds but

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.439 
133 so he won by about 10 seconds but
that<00:04:47.380> was<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.530> close<00:04:47.800> challenge<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.580> think<00:04:48.940> what

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
that was a close challenge I think what

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.909 
that was a close challenge I think what
made<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.720> shorter<00:04:50.139> is<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:50.650> really

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
made it shorter is that I was really

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.300 
made it shorter is that I was really
afraid<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:52.410> table<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.530> pyraminx<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.130> lot

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
afraid to table the pyraminx a lot

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.430 
afraid to table the pyraminx a lot
because<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:55.180> was<00:04:55.870> afraid<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.169> hitting<00:04:56.289> the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
because I was afraid of hitting the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.189 
because I was afraid of hitting the
spacebar<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.889> stopping<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.400> timer<00:04:57.690> if<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.930> had

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
spacebar and stopping the timer if I had

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.409 
spacebar and stopping the timer if I had
a<00:05:00.099> little<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:00.580> more<00:05:00.699> room<00:05:00.940> or<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> keyboard

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
a little bit more room or the keyboard

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.670 
a little bit more room or the keyboard
wasn't<00:05:01.840> here<00:05:01.960> most<00:05:02.169> filming<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.620> was

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
wasn't here most filming it was

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.050 
wasn't here most filming it was
something<00:05:02.979> else<00:05:03.130> then<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.550> probably<00:05:03.789> could

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
something else then I probably could

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.700 
something else then I probably could
have<00:05:04.090> gotten<00:05:04.419> better<00:05:04.539> but<00:05:04.840> hey<00:05:05.349> that's<00:05:05.500> all

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
have gotten better but hey that's all

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.650 
have gotten better but hey that's all
right<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:07.389> he<00:05:08.289> won<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.280> anyway<00:05:10.120> if<00:05:10.419> you<00:05:10.570> would

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
right so he won so anyway if you would

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.210 
right so he won so anyway if you would

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
u qua long came out which the mechanism

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.360 
u qua long came out which the mechanism
just<00:05:49.389> looks<00:05:49.810> like<00:05:49.900> a<00:05:50.229> slightly<00:05:50.560> modified<00:05:50.830> way

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
just looks like a slightly modified way

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.980 
just looks like a slightly modified way
long<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:51.880> just<00:05:52.270> because<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.599> looks<00:05:52.780> so

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
long and just because it looks so

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.170 
long and just because it looks so
similar<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.650> way<00:05:53.860> long<00:05:54.099> I<00:05:54.310> don't<00:05:54.759> think<00:05:55.060> I'm

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
similar to a way long I don't think I'm

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.180 
similar to a way long I don't think I'm
gonna<00:05:55.300> be<00:05:55.509> getting<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.960> so<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:56.560> far<00:05:56.740> as<00:05:56.800> World
