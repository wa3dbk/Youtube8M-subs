now<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> bits<00:01:11.430> interesting<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:13.070> by<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
now this bits interesting so by the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.550 
now this bits interesting so by the
looks<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> every<00:01:15.270> type<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> launcher<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
looks of it every type of launcher that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
looks of it every type of launcher that
the<00:01:17.009> engineer<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.240> an<00:01:18.390> auto<00:01:18.570> lock

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the engineer now has has an auto lock

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.340 
the engineer now has has an auto lock
function<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> new<00:01:20.460> rpg-7<00:01:21.170> aversion<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
function so the new rpg-7 aversion to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.390 
function so the new rpg-7 aversion to
the<00:01:23.060> Stinger<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.900> javelin<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:26.009> have

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the Stinger and the javelin all have

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
the Stinger and the javelin all have
that<00:01:26.670> lock<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.090> function<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.100> call<00:01:29.100> me

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that lock on function I call me

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.340 
that lock on function I call me
old-school<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.350> ortholog

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
old-school but I do not like ortholog

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
old-school but I do not like ortholog
functions<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.509> look<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
functions and if this can now look on to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
functions and if this can now look on to
designated<00:01:34.560> targets<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> point

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
designated targets what would the point

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350 
designated targets what would the point
be<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> javelin<00:01:37.850> unless<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> does<00:01:39.150> more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
be of the javelin unless it does more

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.140 
be of the javelin unless it does more
damage<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:40.579> unless<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.790> something

completely different with it I can't see

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
completely different with it I can't see
there<00:01:45.180> being<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.390> incentive<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.409> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
class can now use them so they're now

designated marksman rifles are now

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.430 
designated marksman rifles are now
universal<00:02:40.790> which<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.120> leaves<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.600> engineer

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
universal which then leaves the engineer

lacking in a specialized weapon so gone
are<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.200> days<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.860> engineered<00:02:47.310> running

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
are the days you see engineered running

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250 
are the days you see engineered running
around<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> m4a1<00:02:48.600> because<00:02:48.930> that's<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
around with the m4a1 because that's the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.410 
around with the m4a1 because that's the
end<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.410> class<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.860> use<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:51.300> it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
end of class you can use it with so it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.050 
end of class you can use it with so it
will<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.570> interesting<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
will be interesting to see how this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.120 
will be interesting to see how this
class<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.720> stack<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:55.650> against<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
class is going to stack up against the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.340 
class is going to stack up against the
other<00:02:56.850> three<00:02:57.240> which<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.840> specialized

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
other three which have specialized

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.200 
other three which have specialized
weapons<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.550> seems<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.790> this<00:02:59.970> one<00:03:00.180> has

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
weapons it just seems that this one has

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.270 
weapons it just seems that this one has
just<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.050> completely<00:03:01.500> universal<00:03:02.040> apart

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
just it's completely universal apart

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.150 
just it's completely universal apart
from<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.490> launchers<00:03:03.620> that's<00:03:04.620> pretty<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.100> it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
from the launchers that's pretty much it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.980 
from the launchers that's pretty much it
for<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.610> engineer<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.570> now<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.720> move<00:03:06.870> on

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
for the engineer one so now we move on

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.840 
for the engineer one so now we move on
to<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.200> assault<00:03:07.440> class<00:03:07.740> now<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.580> see<00:03:08.760> in

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
to the assault class now as you see in

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.360 
to the assault class now as you see in
this<00:03:09.000> screenshot<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:10.530> much<00:03:10.680> has<00:03:10.830> changed<00:03:10.890> as

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
this screenshot not much has changed as

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.970 
this screenshot not much has changed as
you<00:03:11.460> can<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.660> pre<00:03:12.870> alpha<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.500> they

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
you can see this is pre alpha and they

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
you can see this is pre alpha and they
have<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> choice<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.790> various<00:03:15.120> options<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
have a choice of various options a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.840 
have a choice of various options a
grayed<00:03:16.320> out<00:03:16.470> gadget<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.730> be

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
grayed out gadget so that's going to be

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.130 
grayed out gadget so that's going to be
something<00:03:18.000> else<00:03:18.920> m320<00:03:19.920> m26<00:03:20.580> buck<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.240> first<00:03:21.900> aid

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
something else m320 m26 buck a first aid

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.340 
something else m320 m26 buck a first aid
pack<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.800> medic<00:03:23.130> bag<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.120> exactly<00:03:24.780> again

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
pack and a medic bag so exactly again

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.050 
pack and a medic bag so exactly again
this<00:03:25.530> acts<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.430> ammo<00:03:26.640> pack<00:03:26.850> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
this acts just like the ammo pack and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.870 
this acts just like the ammo pack and
the<00:03:27.120> ammo<00:03:27.390> kit<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.820> am<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.060> box<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:32.130> medic

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the ammo kit so so am I box the medic

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.420 
the ammo kit so so am I box the medic
bag<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.720> throw<00:03:34.050> down<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> heals<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
bag you throw down and it heals you and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.699 
bag you throw down and it heals you and
I<00:03:35.490> was<00:03:35.610> around<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.959> first<00:03:37.170> aid<00:03:37.440> pack

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
I was around you and the first aid pack

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.430 
I was around you and the first aid pack
you<00:03:37.890> strapped<00:03:38.250> onto<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.700> squad<00:03:39.360> member<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.959> let

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you strapped onto a squad member and let

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.130 
you strapped onto a squad member and let
them<00:03:40.590> run<00:03:40.800> off<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.390> I'm<00:03:42.390> guessing<00:03:42.870> either<00:03:42.990> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
them run off with I'm guessing either a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.449 
them run off with I'm guessing either a
timed<00:03:44.840> boost<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.110> their<00:03:46.290> health<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
timed boost in their health or just a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.190 
timed boost in their health or just a
set<00:03:47.700> amount<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:48.240> health<00:03:48.480> let's<00:03:48.750> say<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.020> know

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
set amount of health let's say you know

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.850 
set amount of health let's say you know
for<00:03:49.830> example<00:03:49.920> 25<00:03:50.840> extra<00:03:51.840> hit<00:03:52.020> points<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> that

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
for example 25 extra hit points on that

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.070 
for example 25 extra hit points on that
player<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.940> I'll<00:03:54.240> be<00:03:54.330> interested<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:54.870> I'm

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
player so I'll be interested to see I'm

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.540 
player so I'll be interested to see I'm
guessing<00:03:55.740> this<00:03:55.800> could<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> whole<00:03:56.280> load<00:03:56.520> of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
guessing this could be a whole load of
