00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
good well we pretty much got our tail

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.550 
good well we pretty much got our tail
Swift<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.579> disappointing<00:00:29.579> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:29.849> we

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
Swift it was disappointing I think we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
Swift it was disappointing I think we
got<00:00:31.560> whipped<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:33.149> phases<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
got whipped in all three phases of the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.509 
got whipped in all three phases of the
game<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:36.680> clearly<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.070> give<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.340> some

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
game and clearly have to give them some

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:39.860 
game and clearly have to give them some
credit<00:00:38.730> i<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.510> football

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
credit i think they got a good football

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.399 
credit i think they got a good football
team<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.660> certainly<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.750> hope<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.260> play

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
team and certainly I hope we can play

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.180 
team and certainly I hope we can play
better<00:00:43.589> than<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:45.620> coach<00:00:46.620> rather<00:00:46.920> than

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
better than that coach rather than

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.640 
better than that coach rather than
getting<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.640> X's<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.120> O's<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.839> forth<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
getting into X's and O's and so forth is

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.399 
getting into X's and O's and so forth is
it<00:00:49.890> safe<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.790> say<00:00:51.000> there's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> crisis<00:00:52.290> of

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
it safe to say there's a crisis of

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.860 
it safe to say there's a crisis of
confidence<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.100> affects<00:00:53.519> everything<00:00:53.870> guys

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
confidence that affects everything guys

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770 
confidence that affects everything guys
are<00:00:55.050> trying<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.409> do<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.780> don't

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
are trying to do out there I don't

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.289 
are trying to do out there I don't
understand<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.439> mean<00:00:58.619> I<00:00:58.860> mean<00:00:59.549> it

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
understand what you mean I mean it

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:01.990 
understand what you mean I mean it
doesn't<00:01:00.659> look<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.900> times<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.559> players

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
doesn't look at times like the players

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.100 
doesn't look at times like the players
necessarily<00:01:03.000> believe<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.360> themselves<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
necessarily believe in themselves and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
necessarily believe in themselves and
what<00:01:04.530> they're<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.510> don't<00:01:06.510> think

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
what they're trying to do I don't think

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
what they're trying to do I don't think
there's<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.810> biggest<00:01:07.290> difference<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there's that biggest difference in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.749 
there's that biggest difference in
talent<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:11.070> can't<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.670> as

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
talent out there and it can't be as

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.070 
talent out there and it can't be as
simple<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.119> saying<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> coaching<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
simple as saying the coaching is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
simple as saying the coaching is
problematic<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> talents<00:01:14.580> problematic

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
problematic or the talents problematic

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.660 
problematic or the talents problematic
but<00:01:15.750> rather<00:01:15.930> an<00:01:16.290> absence<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> faith<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.460> mean

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
but rather an absence of faith I mean

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.070 
but rather an absence of faith I mean
it's<00:01:17.850> theoretical<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> mean<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.930> Maya

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's theoretical but I mean in Maya

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.940 
it's theoretical but I mean in Maya
perhaps<00:01:20.070> onto<00:01:20.400> something<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
perhaps onto something I don't think so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.730 
perhaps onto something I don't think so
but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.860> mean<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.159> i<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:27.450> never<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:28.050> our

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
but I mean I had i I've never had our

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.660 
but I mean I had i I've never had our
guys<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.600> unless<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:31.460> hide<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.640> very

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
guys think that unless they hide it very

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.950 
guys think that unless they hide it very
well<00:01:32.880> oh<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:34.970> don't<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.600> our<00:01:36.720> guys

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
well oh I don't I don't think our guys

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
well oh I don't I don't think our guys
have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.230> lack<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have a lack of

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.219 
have a lack of
belief<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> their<00:01:40.500> talents<00:01:41.719> with<00:01:42.719> this<00:01:42.930> just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
belief in their talents with this just

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.910 
belief in their talents with this just
my<00:01:43.469> opinion<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:47.719> guess<00:01:48.719> kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.679> did<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
my opinion I guess kind of what did you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
my opinion I guess kind of what did you
see<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.219> on<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.549> terms<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.600> were

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see going on in terms of what they were

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
see going on in terms of what they were
doing<00:01:51.750> defensively<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.649> cause<00:01:52.860> lack<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
doing defensively to cause lack of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
doing defensively to cause lack of
executions<00:01:54.000> pretty<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.390> played<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.719> plate<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
executions pretty much played a plate a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
executions pretty much played a plate a
straight<00:01:55.590> 3-4<00:01:56.340> defense<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.119> didn't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
straight 3-4 defense and they didn't

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
straight 3-4 defense and they didn't
have<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> whole<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.439> mean<00:01:58.679> they<00:01:58.770> ran<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
have to do a whole lot I mean they ran a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.959 
have to do a whole lot I mean they ran a
stunt<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:01.610> when<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.759> got

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
stunt here and there and when we got

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.940 
stunt here and there and when we got
things<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.810> got<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.799> know

they've limited us from big plays and we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.479 
they've limited us from big plays and we
weren't<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.640> enough<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.890> enough<00:02:11.220> reads

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489

weren't good enough to get enough reads
right<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.269> right<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:13.140> finish<00:02:13.470> drives

you know it was a funny game we never
got<00:02:15.900> any<00:02:16.110> rhythm<00:02:16.319> going<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.360> first

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
ended up giving that one away the third

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.339 
ended up giving that one away the third
when<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.340> drive<00:02:35.549> down<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.000> field<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.510> miss<00:02:37.319> a

when we drive down the field and miss a
field<00:02:37.620> goal<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.900> had<00:02:39.930> two

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
field goal and that was that we had two

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.229 
field goal and that was that we had two
ball<00:02:40.260> four<00:02:40.440> times<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:41.489> was<00:02:41.670> never<00:02:41.880> any

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239

chance to pop a couple plays and didn't

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.069

you<00:02:50.340> know<00:02:50.609> got<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> secondary<00:02:51.540> didn't<00:02:51.900> pop

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
you know got in the secondary didn't pop

you know got in the secondary didn't pop
him<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.620> missed<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> read<00:02:53.160> got

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
him and then we missed the read got

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.199 
him and then we missed the read got
behind<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.630> couldn't<00:02:54.900> make<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.109> first<00:02:55.319> down

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
behind we couldn't make the first down

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.759 
behind we couldn't make the first down
so<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.329> didn't<00:02:57.540> convert<00:02:57.870> any<00:02:58.049> third<00:02:58.319> downs<00:02:58.560> we

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
so we didn't convert any third downs we

so we didn't convert any third downs we
had<00:02:58.889> a<00:02:58.920> hard<00:02:59.130> time<00:02:59.190> staying<00:02:59.639> on<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.940> field<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.199 
had a hard time staying on the field and
they<00:03:01.859> did<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.100> pretty<00:03:02.340> good<00:03:02.519> job<00:03:02.579> I<00:03:02.970> don't<00:03:03.120> know

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209

many<00:03:25.880> football<00:03:26.240> games

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.270 

what<00:03:33.080> was<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.379> thought<00:03:33.890> process<00:03:33.950> behind

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
what was the thought process behind

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.250 
what was the thought process behind
putting<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.909> bed<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.080> thought<00:03:36.230> about

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
putting in bed and if you thought about

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.920 
putting in bed and if you thought about
how<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.799> playing<00:03:37.099> well<00:03:37.220> there<00:03:37.400> was<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.900> know

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
how you playing well there was you know

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.440 
how you playing well there was you know
I<00:03:39.080> i<00:03:39.379> intended<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.010> let<00:03:40.580> him<00:03:40.730> play<00:03:40.940> some<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.390> i

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
I i intended to let him play some and i

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.789 
I i intended to let him play some and i
kept<00:03:41.659> thinking<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.049> we<00:03:42.230> would<00:03:42.319> try<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.560> get

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
kept thinking that we would try to get

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.940 
kept thinking that we would try to get
some<00:03:42.980> rhythm<00:03:43.190> or<00:03:43.430> whatever<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:45.680> just

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
some rhythm or whatever and it just

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250 
some rhythm or whatever and it just
became<00:03:46.250> apparent<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.569> wasn't<00:03:47.599> working

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
became apparent that it wasn't working

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.440 
became apparent that it wasn't working
the<00:03:48.349> other<00:03:48.500> way<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.610> we<00:03:49.730> needed<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> put<00:03:50.209> him<00:03:50.330> in

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the other way so we needed to put him in

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:59.500 
the other way so we needed to put him in
and<00:03:50.599> let<00:03:50.690> him<00:03:50.780> play

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.200 

mean

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
mean

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.960 
mean
is<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:01.930> may<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.890> worst<00:04:02.970> offensive

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
is this may be the worst offensive

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.220 
is this may be the worst offensive
performance<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.630> guys<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.900> had<00:04:04.990> since

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
performance you guys have had since

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.570 
performance you guys have had since
you've<00:04:05.380> been<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.800> had<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.100> only<00:04:06.160> ran<00:04:06.520> I

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
you've been here you had I only ran I

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.090 
you've been here you had I only ran I
think<00:04:06.850> 47<00:04:07.390> plays<00:04:07.660> well<00:04:08.200> I'm<00:04:08.380> sure<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.800> I

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
think 47 plays well I'm sure it is I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.070 
think 47 plays well I'm sure it is I
mean<00:04:09.520> I'm<00:04:09.640> sure<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.030> in<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.300> origin<00:04:10.810> and

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
mean I'm sure it is in the origin and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.060 
mean I'm sure it is in the origin and
all<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.410> stuff<00:04:11.560> yeah<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:14.470> think<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.010> a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
all that stuff yeah and I think it was a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.370 
all that stuff yeah and I think it was a
combination<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:16.030> not<00:04:16.870> getting<00:04:17.050> anything

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
combination of not getting anything

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.620 
combination of not getting anything
going<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.130> when<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.910> don't<00:04:19.120> convert<00:04:19.450> on<00:04:19.600> 3rd

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
going and when you don't convert on 3rd

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.110 
going and when you don't convert on 3rd
down<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.170> can't<00:04:20.410> stay<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.830> field<00:04:21.120> yeah

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
down you can't stay on the field yeah

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.700 
down you can't stay on the field yeah
you<00:04:22.780> know<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.930> don't<00:04:23.020> remember<00:04:23.140> I<00:04:23.380> don't<00:04:23.620> know

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
you know I don't remember I don't know

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.800 
you know I don't remember I don't know
how<00:04:23.800> many<00:04:23.980> total<00:04:24.190> possessions<00:04:24.790> we<00:04:24.940> had<00:04:25.150> kind

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
how many total possessions we had kind

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.770 
how many total possessions we had kind
of<00:04:25.930> been<00:04:26.050> more<00:04:26.200> than<00:04:26.440> eight<00:04:26.640> probably<00:04:30.780> it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
of been more than eight probably it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.660 
of been more than eight probably it
seemed<00:04:32.140> like<00:04:32.380> their<00:04:32.680> front<00:04:33.040> particularly<00:04:33.490> odd

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
seemed like their front particularly odd

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.250 
seemed like their front particularly odd
number<00:04:33.910> 47<00:04:34.420> on<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.720> gave<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.050> lot<00:04:35.170> of
