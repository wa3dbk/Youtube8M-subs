00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hey girls and guys i had you on 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.109
 tuesday asked which video today am 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 friday wants to see and yes very many 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.920
 of you wanted to see the drugstore obsolete 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.590
 and many on the free market though 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.000
 drogerie won and therefore 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.740
 I wish you much fun with that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 Video 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 I start with this concealer 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 palette here from patrice quite a lot of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 you know and use them too 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 why I got this palette 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.570
 was simply because I completely 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 had many red spots on his face and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 I did not cover it but yes 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.370
 get with my normal goals so 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 that one has really nice again 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 seen and I knew yes there is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.649
 but the sequential palette with the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 green concealer in it and then thought 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 me hey is really cool compact 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 So you really have all kinds 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.039
 Nobody needs colors, you just need green 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.550
 for red spots this pinkl comes and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.289
 in the eyes around eye shadow again yes 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 not cover but this gray too 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.019
 neutralize 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 and then you have three different ones 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.500
 Sounds just for covering so seen 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.659
 and i love who i already have 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.619
 she really often used so far so 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.659
 actually every day 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 and what I think is nice with that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 the colors can also mix and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 Now I have to decide a bit 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 I will not show you one quickly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.409
 Ruppel the products but I'll show it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 simply because I'm not doing one now 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.369
 I roll high-end like in a product 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 Wellfit me the union mascara 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 bought back and you want 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.590
 Of course, all of that is my absolute 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.570
 favorite city cara i love that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.810
 brush july consistent i love what 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.899
 with my eyelashes hired so yes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 a bit cheating here 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.280
 if you happen to me often or just up 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.180
 instagram then you already know something now 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.260
 speak of it and it is definitely one 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.790
 hype product or device brand the now 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.400

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.760
 There is really a super big one 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.150

 My hair was so sweet all over 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.180
 unspectacular in berlin massive the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.700
 should still come with this too 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.340
 big patch much better than 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.190
 this little one because I just this one 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.170
 big area faster my make-up 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.680

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.239
 just have to stop with the very small ones 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.340
 be james cook aim hard drive from 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.340

 glossy effect so this effect on 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.720
 my nails and it is actually like that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.850
 that my nail polish dries faster 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.160
 when I was about to do about it here 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.790
 the only problem I have with it 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.640
 is that sometimes when I'm too much 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.979
 use that instead of a dry one 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.960
 shampoos and I am very satisfied 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.760

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.100
 like to have and that is not so 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.870
 I do not really like it 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.710
 the whole thing behaves when her dark hair 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.630
 Had not trusted that afterwards 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.910
 looks on your hair 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.530

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.750
 no longer displayed from a high list 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.750
