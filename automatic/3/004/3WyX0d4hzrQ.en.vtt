is if a if you don't have a high budget

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.450 
is if a if you don't have a high budget
and<00:04:07.380> you're<00:04:07.530> not<00:04:07.740> really<00:04:08.010> doing<00:04:08.190> anything

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
into a PC it's going to be cheaper it's

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.340 
into a PC it's going to be cheaper it's
going<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.000> efficient<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:19.110> going<00:04:19.260> to
