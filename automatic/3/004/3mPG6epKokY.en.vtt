inject the vehicle up somehow and then

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
inject the vehicle up somehow and then
support<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.720> underneath<00:00:27.720> they're<00:00:27.990> sort<00:00:28.199> of

fall on you or fall on somebody and we
have<00:00:31.320> 18<00:00:31.679> millimeter<00:00:32.099> bolts<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.320> 21

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
have 18 millimeter bolts up here and 21

millimeter<00:00:35.370> bolts<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.530> have<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
millimeter bolts up here I have it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
millimeter bolts up here I have it
slightly<00:00:38.340> supported<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.540> fall

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
slightly supported because it will fall

00:00:39.840 --> 00:01:12.720 
slightly supported because it will fall
a<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:40.320> bit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:24.180 

a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:20.170> wiggle<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.680> it's<00:01:21.310> out<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:23.740> that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
a little wiggle and it's out like that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.580 
a little wiggle and it's out like that
if<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.240> difficulty<00:01:25.810> putting<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.350> new<00:01:26.470> one

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
if you have difficulty putting a new one

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.410 
if you have difficulty putting a new one
up<00:01:26.710> here<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.980> can<00:01:27.100> maybe<00:01:27.220> use<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> pry<00:01:28.150> bar<00:01:28.180> or

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
up here you can maybe use a pry bar or

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.540 
up here you can maybe use a pry bar or
something<00:01:28.770> open<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.890> up<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.070> little<00:01:30.160> bit<00:01:30.400> but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
something open that up a little bit but

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.830 
something open that up a little bit but
you<00:01:30.640> shouldnt<00:01:30.820> have<00:01:30.910> any<00:01:31.060> problems

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you shouldnt have any problems

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.910 
you shouldnt have any problems
doing<00:01:32.260> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 

but<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> new<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.120> like<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.690> old<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.960> came

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
but the new one in like the old one came

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.880 
but the new one in like the old one came
out<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.479> top<00:01:39.720> bolt<00:01:39.990> started<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.650> if

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
out that the top bolt started and if

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.320 
out that the top bolt started and if
this<00:01:41.040> doesn't<00:01:41.370> line<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.880> simply<00:01:42.180> give

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
this doesn't line up you can simply give

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.380 
this doesn't line up you can simply give
it<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.510> twist<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> twists<00:01:44.180> train<00:01:45.180> just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it a twist see it twists train just

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.570 
it a twist see it twists train just
twist<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> line<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.080> up<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.070> let<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
twist and line it up and then let the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.390 
twist and line it up and then let the
jack<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.540> line<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
jack down a little bit to line up that a

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.540 
jack down a little bit to line up that a
little<00:01:50.400> better<00:01:50.490> probably<00:01:52.009> stick<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.160> bolt<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
little better probably stick my bolt in

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.420 
little better probably stick my bolt in
there<00:01:54.020> yeah<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.619> also<00:01:55.740> maybe<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.220> lift

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
there yeah you can also maybe just lift

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
there yeah you can also maybe just lift
up<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.910> shock<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.869> have

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
up on the shock because you have

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
up on the shock because you have
strength<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.830> do<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.450> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> hole<00:02:01.610> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
strength to do that in the hole it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.949 
strength to do that in the hole it
started<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> start<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> bolts<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:03.720> hand<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
started to start the bolts by hand and

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:28.009 
started to start the bolts by hand and
