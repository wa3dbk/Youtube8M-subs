start at the toe and work towards the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
start at the toe and work towards the
back<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> take<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> look<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
back we can take a look at some of the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920 
back we can take a look at some of the
features<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.130> crossfire<00:01:08.640> twos<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.720> toe

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
features of these crossfire twos the toe

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
features of these crossfire twos the toe
box<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.500> reinforced<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.640> also<00:01:11.909> completely

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
box is reinforced and also completely

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
box is reinforced and also completely
covered<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.080> thermoplastic<00:01:14.040> urethane<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
covered with thermoplastic urethane so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
covered with thermoplastic urethane so
there's<00:01:15.210> no<00:01:15.360> edges<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> catch<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> come<00:01:16.770> apart

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there's no edges to catch and come apart

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's no edges to catch and come apart
so<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.700> toe<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> handle

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so this toe is really going to handle

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
so this toe is really going to handle
some<00:01:18.990> serious<00:01:19.380> abuse<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.400> notice<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
some serious abuse and notice also that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
some serious abuse and notice also that
the<00:01:21.299> stitches<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.290> high<00:01:22.439> wear<00:01:22.650> areas<00:01:22.680> are

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the stitches and the high wear areas are

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
the stitches and the high wear areas are
recessed<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> stitching<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.020> basically

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
recessed so the stitching is basically

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
recessed so the stitching is basically
protected<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> panels<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> it's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
are a European race boot so they're cut

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.960 
are a European race boot so they're cut
fairly<00:02:44.140> narrow<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:44.950> fat<00:02:45.310> footed<00:02:45.640> fellers

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970

that for extra-large calf muscles you

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.610 
that for extra-large calf muscles you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
need more than just longer straps

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.770
