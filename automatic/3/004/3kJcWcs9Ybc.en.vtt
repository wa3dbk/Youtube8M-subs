00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello let's make us our 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.460
 own cutters or cut pasta 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.970
 homemade as you see with a can of 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 beer that I rinsed previously I'll 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.480
 cut it I'm going to cut an arito 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.419
 and I'm using a cutter you can 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 use scissors do it on a 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:27.359
 rubber surface like mine or where 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 a cutting board for example where not 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 you run the risk of damaging the table and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 be very careful with your hands and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 the fingers if this is not for children is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 for adults because if the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.230
 aim for example the scissors you can 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 do enough damage we are going to cut them 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.519
 as I say a little slice or a ring 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 about 4 centimeters more or less so that 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.960
 we can grasp it well or higher if 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 you want also you see here I have it and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950
 Now what we are going to do is match it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.810
 with the scissors 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.810
 let's cut it as straight as possible 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.690
 so that by supporting it on the ground 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.540
 touch all the parts on the table I want 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.400
 say and now it's as easy as folding it 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.380
 with the shape we want, I'm going to do 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.820
 first a heart as you see I put a 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 and in part to make the peck of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 tip 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.560
 my cutter in the form of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.000
 Heart is seen to be super easy 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.500
 many times it happens to us that maybe we have 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 to do some form in the fondant 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.300
 for a cake a cupcake a cookie or 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.370
 a paste just and we do not have the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.830
 suitable cutter find one is expensive 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.690
 we will use only once so 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 this can serve you 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.600
 Now I'm going to make a square 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.220
 and as you can see, he has cut another arito 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
 doubled in half I do not have to 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.280
 fold again in half on the side 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.100
 opposite to make a square 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.840
 I give it the shape I want and I have it 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.670
 ready they are a little more flimsy 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.740
 obviously that those that are bought that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.690
 they are stiffer and harder but for 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.119
 get out of a hurry to do forms like this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.770
 fast we can perfectly you can 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.800
 make a circle too but good is 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.680
 very easy I'm going to make a little sheet of 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.350
 Christmas as you see I'm doing the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.090
 angles I'm bending, it bends very easy 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.550
 the can much easier than you think 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.830
 very soft you see if it looks like a little leaf 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.080
 of holly 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 yes, the sizes that I got are the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.980
 can sizes if you want to make us 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 you will have to put a little 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.200
 zeal for example cut and paste them 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.780
 with silicone a zeleta let's try them 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 and here I have stretched and fondant that no 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.780
 I 've been very clever doing the reds 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.670
 on the red carpet does not look very good 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.430
 I should have picked another color 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.910
 forgive me but well here you see it 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.620
 our form comes out perfectly 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.210
 so you already know and when you want to do 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040
 a shape of a cutter that you do not have 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.590
 before doing it by hand that is so 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.770
 easy to do it with a can that does not deserve 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.600
 it's worth risking doing it wrong 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.190
 we take a little care with no 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.870
 cut that if I tell you when you press the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.700
 you have a lot of eye because you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.070
 you can cut I hope you liked it 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.720
 this idea that is practical and I leave you 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.390
 another pair some decorative letters of 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 cardboard made with cereal boxes and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.440
 let's dye salt to make other 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.210
 crafts I send you a hug very 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.750
 strong and do not forget to subscribe to the channel
