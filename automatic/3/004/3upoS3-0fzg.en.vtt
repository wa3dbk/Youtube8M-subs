00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
cutscenes and I just really liked how

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440

they<00:00:40.559> implemented<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.520> two<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> half<00:00:42.210> D

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
they implemented the two and a half D

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.410 
they implemented the two and a half D
graphics<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.530> 3d<00:00:44.489> graphics<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
graphics with 3d graphics which is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.639 
graphics with 3d graphics which is
pretty<00:00:45.600> cool<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.379> take

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
pretty cool so as you can see they take

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
pretty cool so as you can see they take
a<00:00:49.680> turn<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> turn<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.660> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
a turn and then you take a turn you have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
a turn and then you take a turn you have
a<00:00:51.840> variety<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.469> weapons<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.190> choose<00:00:53.430> from

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a variety of weapons to choose from

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
a variety of weapons to choose from
obviously<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:55.050> aren't<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> weapons

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
obviously these aren't all the weapons

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
obviously these aren't all the weapons
throughout<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> game<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

you'll<00:01:03.660> take<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> turn<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> they'll<00:01:05.489> take

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you'll take a turn here and they'll take

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.590 
you'll take a turn here and they'll take
a<00:01:05.700> turn<00:01:05.939> shooting<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.330> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
cool I really like this this is the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.060 
cool I really like this this is the
sniper<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
sniper where you look you use the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.929 
sniper where you look you use the
accelerometer<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.150> aim<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.610> could<00:01:17.790> do

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
accelerometer to aim it and you could do

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.469 
accelerometer to aim it and you could do
a<00:01:17.970> headshot<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.610> scope<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.180> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a headshot to get out of scope you just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.980 
a headshot to get out of scope you just
press<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.780> weapon<00:01:22.320> key<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.780> use

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
press your weapon key and you could use

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
press your weapon key and you could use
many<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.640> weapons<00:01:27.259> here<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.829> health

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
many other weapons here is your health

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.289 
many other weapons here is your health
items<00:01:30.560> inventory<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:32.970> different

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
items inventory so you can use different

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
items inventory so you can use different
types<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> syringes<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.290> power<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
types of syringes to power you up and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.170 
types of syringes to power you up and
just<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.240> RPG<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.610> anger

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
just like in any RPG so I can use anger

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.069 
just like in any RPG so I can use anger
and<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:41.030> increase<00:01:42.030> my<00:01:42.420> damage<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and this will increase my damage I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.639 
and this will increase my damage I
believe<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> let's<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.860> submachine<00:01:47.549> gun

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
believe so let's use a submachine gun

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.220 
believe so let's use a submachine gun
and<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.250> easy<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.670> kill<00:01:50.850> them

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.490 

you<00:01:56.230> can<00:01:56.440> also<00:01:57.030> use<00:01:58.030> health<00:01:58.360> packs<00:01:58.630> but<00:01:59.170> it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
you can also use health packs but it

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.770 
you can also use health packs but it
takes<00:01:59.740> one<00:02:00.040> turn<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:03.330> let<00:02:04.330> me<00:02:04.420> show<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.630> how
