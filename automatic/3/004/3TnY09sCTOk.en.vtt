00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 but if about bread you can somehow 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 less do not worry this here olives 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.880
 now have to buy more carefully 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.960
 with excessive use 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 canned berries can even fall 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.309
 to whom in green olives producers 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 turns in oil now natural 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.380
 by using glitches and iron more often 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 total this product is sold to tin 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 banks for what manufacturers 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.720
 use chemistry and how to protect yourself 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 tell sergey nazin here and some 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 time they are from simple green such 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 same olives will turn from to black 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.450
 which are near 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 knowledge of the subject of chemistry 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 makes it easy to do miraculous 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
 turn olives into olives 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 green fruit in mouth van rope iron 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 and after a few minutes olives 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 blackening before the eyes of the procedure is simple and not 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.649
 requires special costs such olives us 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.620
 turned out about 2 hours after 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 the introduction of the solution is now only left 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.030
 in the bank spin and sell and how 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 experts say food in the last 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.359
 time by this trick 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.040
 manufacturers use quite often 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.170
 the vast majority of olives 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.479
 sold in stores actually 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.460
 blackened olives at the same time distinguish 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.290
 real olives from fake residents 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.659
 our country can hardly have us 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.220
 beneficial fruits do not grow in nature 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 but the one who ever tried in his life 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 real difference notice right away 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 i feel like i'm a son of grass 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.730
 here or something like that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.820
 grassy 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.690
 greek pig plants of course this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.240
 completely different here excuse me 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.780
 Actually, though I love but not so much 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.910
 to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.950
 There is something that is sold on our shelves 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.390
 Irina lived for two years in Greece where 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.460
 very fond of olives 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.550
 they are juicy and melt in your mouth remembers 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.450
 girl that's why they are very difficult 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.640
 transport and recycle 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.010
 spoil quickly produce olives for 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.780
 olives of course much more profitable but 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.090
 how will uncontrolled health impact 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.480
 I use gluconate iron 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.820
 to tell 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.810
 Do manufacturers take into account when they enter 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.910
 this food supplement and in which 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.430
 concentration will be well here unfortunately 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.710
 maker decree meanwhile gluconate 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.870
 iron is not a dietary supplement but medication 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.940
 any medicine has side effects 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.400
 and severe consequences in overdose 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.170
 the solution is able to cause hepatic and 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.270
 renal failure allergies 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.580
 lowering blood pressure and even 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.620
 to whom all this of course happens at 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.720
 individual tolerance of the substance and 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.100
 a lot of it but that's about it 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.170
 on a jar of oil 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.930
 don't write them written in ink 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.740
 black olives blackened olives rather 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.600
 as if we are 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.910
 tomas thomas lynn and these are olives and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.700
 consumer is not aware of what exactly he 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.970
 consumes most often iron gluconate 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.680
 bank sign as e 579 that the usual 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.020
 consumer does not give any useful 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.880
 Information Society for the Protection of Rights 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.160
 consumers say it â€™s typical 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.350
 only for our country abroad on 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.239
 bank detail with oil paint 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.239
 what the buyer actually acquires
