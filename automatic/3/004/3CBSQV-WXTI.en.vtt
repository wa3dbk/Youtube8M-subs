 It is the cult to then shop to see the best 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.559
 Team moments I want to start 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 highlighting the main player of the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 team the rasar it has 88 general it plays 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
 there on the left most expensive line will 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 want to tip left you the guy 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 always looking to play you can see 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 that it is being properly placed ends 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 very well 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.570
 boat with two he who is not 57 years old 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.390
 bad leg but look just like he beats 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.149
 good left leg always hitting 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the goal it is also very good and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.309
 come here looking for plays in the middle of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.390
 the fifth area, the brother is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.549
 at the tip 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.100
 he is very agile see only that bid that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 I can make a great book now. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.900
 I will not finish the goal did a 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.850
 great defense in this move also taking 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.009
 a defender in the cool move of finesse 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 and brown with difficulty managed 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.970
 make the defense but in ours that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 showing the good use of it is sensational 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 It took everyone here beating finesse 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the corner with no chance for goalkeeper 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.909
 now another player who stood out 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.130
 much on this team was an extensive letter 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.829
 in the form of retention of left half I 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 I put it on the right hand side with 7 of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.600
 with the technician to be well placed 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.729
 he looks great on this team that was 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.790
 he is very similar to act rasar plays 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.020
 but a little bit but it's weak going 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.549
 rock out better than him 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.250
 but look how good you are always 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.800
 placed and takes very well on the ball he is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 very light and look at that bid 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.040
 there is a lot of agility that ends well for the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.900
 now another player is also 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.750
 highlighted was a landa he is a flyer 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.490
 silver and made this beautiful bid have other 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.040
 nine too but it ends very well 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.350
 for the goal he remembered the report without doubt 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.630
 is the official team foul collector 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.270
 still balls is always with it puts 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.010
 by hand and also in bids account now 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.960
 with you, how is he here? 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.600
 positions very well and ends for the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.550
 great goal letter the letter informs 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 December go and now let's talk about our 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.470
 gold here I'm going to stay with man off the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.750
 net the guy is simply sensational 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
 playing with him he has a physical strength 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.830
 absurd looks just how he stands 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.260
 very well also made the pass this move 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 It was very well done he brought here to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.930
 within the area and by far and made a film 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.090
 shock 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.310
 It's incredible he's taking the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 in the car he stands very 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.940
 right there playing on block 33 here 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 with that, right? 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
 but my it is always within the area 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.670
 positioning yourself or looking for 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.250
 to finish looks this shot hit 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 left he does not miss the goal and it's 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.420
 too hard to take the ball from him great 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.580
 bids is also fetching the crosses 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.010
 He always looks at the corner. 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 this goal where he did it is very 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.850
 well positioned in the middle of the area now 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 another good move from razak to 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.500
 He says his name and in the car he leaves there 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.140
 and look for a good position so that the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 razer use it make the head goal 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.830
 here you will also see that the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.900
 they have a great price too. 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.360
 he can not act on physical force and he 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.100
 only had in the corner but a goal by luca 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.470
 And now the guys have arrived, besides talking 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.209
 wall that defends the goal of the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 belgium what is air theft 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.319
 the very young goalie chelsea the guy 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.909
 It's absurd to look at the wall 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.760
 one of the best goalkeepers if not the best 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.680
 number of this type to 15 total voucher there 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.599
 actions that you invest in this goalkeeper 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.040
 because he saved in several games 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.700
 had even part of the gang play a 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.549
 he got there because he picks up 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.620
 very much, look, this defense, he grabs 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.750
 a neymar shot right here too 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.170
 in the neighborhood that is too finicky and he 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.000
 closing the goal completely then it is 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.669
 That's the way it was chosen and 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.230
 hertha belgium and we have the 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.639
 main players I want to play 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 for you are the top three 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.439
 players and yes to me that was the short 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.010
 there defending everything in the goal 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:15.049
 car letter nor submit it 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.750
 the sensational guy played 12 matches 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.130
 making ten goals is for us and giving 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.380
 two assists 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.320
 and for me the best player on this team is 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.970
 he's playing in the stocking 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.340
 left but if you saw the bids 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.020
 that he always seeks the middle of the area and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.789
 ends well for the goal 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.520
 very agile for me the best player 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.530
 of this kind a precise note from 0 to 10 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.050
 would be 8 is a team that has a defense 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.389
 very good to have the short to the goal there and 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.949
 kompany until overton and he who ventures 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.720
 a little more it goes a little more 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.970
 attack but still defend very well 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.060
 the middle course I found a bit weak and 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.830
 I think bruyne's is a very good creator. 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.259
 of plays but we need to 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.770
 players for marking we have there 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.539
 in the bank the fla and the rascal but even 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.490
 so I found that the marking in the middle 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.780
 field got a bit flawed I hope 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.310
