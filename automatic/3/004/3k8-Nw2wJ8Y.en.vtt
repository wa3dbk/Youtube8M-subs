however unlike those that have multiple
figures<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.769> only<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.430> figure

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
because froggy as you see over here is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.060 
because froggy as you see over here is
really<00:00:27.300> tiny<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> doesn't<00:00:28.740> really<00:00:28.859> do

really tiny and doesn't really do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.670 
really tiny and doesn't really do
anything<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.340> it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
toy line that I have seen so far to give
you<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.539> idea<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.289> big<00:01:01.530> he<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you an idea of how big he is here is a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.359 
you an idea of how big he is here is a
3.5<00:01:03.390> inch<00:01:03.690> tails<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> he<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> scale<00:01:08.010> with

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
3.5 inch tails so he is the scale with

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.410 
3.5 inch tails so he is the scale with
the<00:01:08.549> rest<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> toy<00:01:09.150> line<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> size

froggy on the other hand he is cute
however<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.780> he<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.590> solid

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
however as you see he is just a solid
piece<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.130> plastic<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.119> no<00:01:21.360> articulation

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
piece of plastic he has no articulation

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
piece of plastic he has no articulation
doesn't<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.830> anything<00:01:23.040> he's<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
kind of there well that's alright

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:38.209 
kind of there well that's alright
because<00:01:26.990> big<00:01:27.990> cat<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.369> detail

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:48.330 

he<00:01:39.219> bends<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:44.380> these<00:01:44.799> do<00:01:45.100> twist<00:01:47.340> like

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
he bends here now these do twist like

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.480 
he bends here now these do twist like
that<00:01:48.719> however<00:01:49.719> they<00:01:50.289> don't<00:01:50.439> really<00:01:50.770> go<00:01:51.130> side

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
that however they don't really go side

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.480 
that however they don't really go side
to<00:01:51.520> side<00:01:52.799> even<00:01:53.799> though<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.039> looks<00:01:54.220> like<00:01:54.369> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
to side even though it looks like it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.969 
to side even though it looks like it
does<00:01:54.700> they<00:01:55.210> do<00:01:55.270> not<00:01:55.600> but<00:01:55.960> he<00:01:56.170> does<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.920> some

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
does they do not but he does have some

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.980 
does they do not but he does have some
movement<00:01:57.490> there<00:01:58.090> his<00:01:58.929> head<00:02:03.090> elbow<00:02:04.090> and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
movement there his head elbow and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:15.839 
movement there his head elbow and
shoulder<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.040> liked<00:02:15.310> him<00:02:15.549> to<00:02:15.700> have

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
shoulder I would have liked him to have

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.009 
shoulder I would have liked him to have
had<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.269> fishing<00:02:16.480> pole<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:17.079> he<00:02:17.230> had<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.769> the

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
had the fishing pole like he had in the

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.140 
had the fishing pole like he had in the
Dreamcast<00:02:20.019> games<00:02:20.319> however<00:02:20.910> he<00:02:21.910> does<00:02:22.120> not

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
Dreamcast games however he does not

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.630 
Dreamcast games however he does not
probably<00:02:23.110> because<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.010> would<00:02:24.099> either<00:02:24.220> be<00:02:24.340> too

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
probably because it would either be too

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.569 
probably because it would either be too
fragile<00:02:24.970> or<00:02:25.870> Jazwares<00:02:26.739> was<00:02:27.010> maybe<00:02:27.250> afraid

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
fragile or Jazwares was maybe afraid

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.250 
fragile or Jazwares was maybe afraid
that<00:02:27.910> they'd<00:02:28.150> some<00:02:28.750> kids<00:02:28.989> would<00:02:29.110> hurt

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
that they'd some kids would hurt

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.630 
that they'd some kids would hurt
themselves<00:02:29.470> with<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.010> or<00:02:30.099> something<00:02:30.459> who

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
themselves with it or something who

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.190 
themselves with it or something who
knows<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:33.040> even<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.610> bring<00:02:33.730> costs<00:02:34.120> down

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
knows or even just to bring costs down

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
knows or even just to bring costs down
but<00:02:35.200> overall<00:02:35.829> it's<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.610> good<00:02:36.760> figure<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
but overall it's a good figure for the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.080 
but overall it's a good figure for the
toy<00:02:38.140> collectors<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.860> like<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.250> stuff

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.160 

there<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.299> have<00:02:43.540> big<00:02:44.109> cat<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.709> froggy
