00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.840
 we are in the factory that attack for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.170
 present the first crane on the market 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.170
 zero gravity the g2 plus series 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.820
 what is zero gravity let's imagine that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.800
 this is a crane here would be the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.080
 counterweights this is the axis and here 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.660
 would be the camera when we move the crane 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.690
 and we release it this tends to the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.690
 horizontal with the g2 blue series this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400
 We can position the crane where 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 want 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.730
 without it returning to the horizontal 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.730
 a crane with an exquisite softness 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.850
 and exquisite in any direction we go 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.600
 with the fire tests we call it the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.600
 100 proof 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.090
 of course we can slow down 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.760
 progressively the crane using the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.100
 Vertical shaft brake shaft brake 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.740
 Horizontal and brake lever 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.530
 activity 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 extremely soft useful that does not affect 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.200
 to the rest of the axes of the test and everything 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.170
 Thank you 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.650
 to a zero gravity head 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.490
 also with this simple gesture we can 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.860
 burn genitals 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.290
 The G2 Blues Series is a rigid crane 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 telescopic and portable a light test 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.140
 that supports heavy cameras 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.140
 yes
