00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
it's two ways when I'm drawing as well

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.240

so I will show you exactly what they do

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
so I will show you exactly what they do
to<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.609> drawings<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
to my drawings and what they will do to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.600 
to my drawings and what they will do to
your<00:00:29.279> drawings<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.660> started

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
your drawings so let's get started

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.900 
your drawings so let's get started
alright<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.260> almost<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
alright so the first way is almost the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270 
alright so the first way is almost the
way<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> hold<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> pencil<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> are

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
way that you hold a pencil when you are

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.819 
way that you hold a pencil when you are
writing<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.690> pretty<00:00:39.899> much<00:00:40.079> put<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.500> fingers

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
writing you pretty much put your fingers

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
writing you pretty much put your fingers
all<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> arrow<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
all the way down to the arrow to the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680 
all the way down to the arrow to the
point<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:44.550> hold<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
point and you hold it like that and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.729 
point and you hold it like that and
start<00:00:46.140> drawing<00:00:46.969> this<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.450> good<00:00:48.780> because

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
start drawing this way is good because

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.760 
start drawing this way is good because
it<00:00:50.640> gives<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.449> control<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> pencil

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it gives you a for control of the pencil

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.799 
it gives you a for control of the pencil

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and also it's also good to do small

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
and also it's also good to do small
little<00:00:57.840> details<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> for

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
little details because you have a for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.860 
little details because you have a for
control<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> pencil<00:01:01.940> plus<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.510> also

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
control of the pencil plus it's also

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
now the second way is a little bit

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
now the second way is a little bit
different<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:15.030> you're<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.570> move<00:01:15.810> your

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the pencil or higher now this way is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.670 
the pencil or higher now this way is
good<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:23.540> well<00:01:24.540> first<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.500> way
