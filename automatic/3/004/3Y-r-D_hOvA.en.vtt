00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 and hello to all and with you I am Mr. explay 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.870
 and today i will show you how to install 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 cards on minecraft 1 5 2 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.779
 well, or any other version of what is 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.750
 you have to start what we need 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 Now I will close all daddies so that they do not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.539
 interfered I apologize for not being prepared 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 I just started recording video like that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 spontaneously 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.260
 Here we take in the search engine overboard 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.200
 downloaded for example how do i download maps 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 for passage for minecraft 1.5.2 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.590
 open any site so I found this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.450
 card die or pass 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 downloadable but I already downloaded it for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 An example will show another card which 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.210
 delve so find now become 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.730
 good would you be on horseback from which shaking 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 downloaded maps change due 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.379
 some writing down 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.309
 and shoot a video for the first time we understand 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.700
 probably worried about it do not judge 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700
 strictly 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 Now we have a website at work 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.049
 look swinging spring card or not 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.360
 so here is this card I will not swing 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.390
 all because I’m no longer her 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 it will be uninteresting to re-pass 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 microsd approved 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.570
 report download if it is here 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:41.750
 is being downloaded 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.750
 Now let's see the map itself. 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.030
 Of course I'm not very English 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.150
 friends on 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 the card is called in English therefore 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.540
 so for fake myself I will not read 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.160
 name click download now from us 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.040
 For a long time, here was a neat climb 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.850
 show what dreams 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.550
 look not taken off exercise very 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.550
 strongly apologize for that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.820
 from here we don’t download because there are so many 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.720
 sites throws us 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.270
 so let's find something else 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.260
 Anything simpler site any 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.260
 pretty and for example well here 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 Now we will open our website for 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.930
 waiting for download 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.340
 and I beg you in the comments and 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.939
 mother, I don’t need to call me that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:04.720
 see I can't shoot a video just 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:07.000
 wounds there really need to sleep, and I, too, 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 will not be very good if you like 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.430
 call all the names out better by yourself 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.349
 just if you write yourself 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.950
 video anyone find an old man 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.879
 which the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.760
 and you review here's a map now she 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:33.209
 download literally 1 month left 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 while you can roll shut shut down and wait 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:44.940
 Now we will wait a little bit 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.940
 on us why brakes don't know why 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.170
 well in general 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.780
 for now how the card swings 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.650
 we click search here we write 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.110

 in her washing daddy with you and open 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.240
 Here we see our worlds like this map 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.090
 which I burned out 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.720
 what I have already downloaded is die or pass 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.630
 here is another map I downloaded everything here 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 in general, while it does not matter, we will do it like this 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.130
 here 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.000

 here we see here is the player here are two 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.139
 people in total participated on this map 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.970
 apparently they built together 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.310
 but I don't know, I'm not exactly telling you. 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.150
 I will because no one has made this card 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.490

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:09.190
