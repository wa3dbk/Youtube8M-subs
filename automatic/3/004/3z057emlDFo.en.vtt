 know which car is causing the most 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.439

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 look in the new Volga features of the old 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.460
 meaningless 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.450
 Volber Cyber ​​design can not be called new 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.780
 word in automotive but looks 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.700
 the car is solid and elegant body stretched 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.540
 and pressed to the ground which creates good 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 aerodynamics 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.350

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.270
 drove on the Volga Cyber ​​almost 13 thousand 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.420
 kilometers and not disappointed for it 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.770
 only a couple of flaws were revealed

 a cricket appeared in the right door which 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.450
 most now in a couple of weeks these 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.739
 deficiencies are resolved by a visit to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.090

 free head space is wrong 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.549
 a lot of people tall or lush 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.489

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.350
 at my 180 centimeters open spaces 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.890
 Enough driving ergonomics 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.450
 places suits almost everything 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.620

 wide lever machine 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.650
 cons can be attributed to the location 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.019
 emergency button city driving say 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.100
 thanks or sorry winking lights 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.440
 it is not easy 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.560
 if the steering wheel is turned to the button 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.049
 reach for a classic dashboard

 computer air conditioning quickly cools 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.810
 salon and heated seats 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.090
 in strong mode can even fry 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.840
 through the sheepskin coat there is heating and outside 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.849
 mirrors 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.069
 Volga Cyber ​​is equipped with a radio with 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.870
 cd player audio 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.269
 the system produces good sound but not 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.930
 familiar with mp3 format and have no inputs 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.250
 for the player or beat the salon is where 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.500
 scatter small items 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.510
 two niches in the center panel place in 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.260
 armrest plus traditional glove box 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.090
 door and seat back pockets 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 plastics that trim the interior hard 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.500
 and unpretentious on the second row there 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 armrest and mounting for children 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.430
 back seats feel 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.650
 quite freely but the most convenient 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.310
 the passenger seat is located to the right of 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.970

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.040
 from the salon 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.720
 hidden under the floor spare tire 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.379
 leave plenty of space for things 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.459
 and the backs of the rear seats can be folded 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.940
 disadvantage for a car of this level 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.560
 lack of upholstery 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.340
 the fuel cap opens with a key and 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090
 no other way 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.070
 the tank holds over 60 liters of gasoline 92 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.010
 or 95 we refuel 95 under the hood 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.900
 143 strong chrysler engine volume 2 and 4 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.729
 with him on saver bye 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.620
 set only 4-step 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.370
 machine with manual selection 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.410
 arrival speeds in winter owners will appreciate 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.610
 traction control 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.800
 manual box will be offered in 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.479
 near low speed 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.099
 for example, when starting from the spot 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.020
 all sorts enough to quickly dial 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.570
 speed or change lanes 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.060
 row but for traffic lights saber not 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.490
 designed for hastily ride salon 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.099
 Noise-rich fuel consumption 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.990
 increases it can grow to 15 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.080
 liters then as usually kept in 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.849
 city within 11 liters suspension 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.400
 sidera is significantly tougher than his 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.340
 American counterpart comfort less 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.200
 but there is no buildup on uneven roads 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.479
 on the line and in the corners the car leads 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.430
 yourself stably confidence save 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.180
 high speed prices quickly reduce 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.210
 which can grasp the drive 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.340
 you brakes on the dirt road, you can also go 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.800
 quickly but to overcome the big pits 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:35.100
 god saber is not ready to be a hindrance 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.990
 our long front overhang is short 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.660
 Ownership experience says Volga Cyber 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.490
 this is a problem free car on this we 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.830
 finish the presentation of the model but 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.180
 Cyber remains in the editorial about 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.009
 operation and maintenance 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.139
 Nizhny Novgorod car, we will tell 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.190
 after the planned one to which it remains 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.190
 not for long
