want to share so if you go out of battle
and<00:00:57.600> normally<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:58.859> using

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and normally you know if you're using

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
and normally you know if you're using
the<00:00:59.160> touchpad<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.910> select

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the touchpad you're gonna select

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
the touchpad you're gonna select
pokeball<00:01:01.579> you're<00:01:02.579> gonna<00:01:02.670> select<00:01:02.940> your

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
pokeball you're gonna select your

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840 
pokeball you're gonna select your
Pokemon<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:04.409> gonna<00:01:04.500> select<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> move

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Pokemon you're gonna select use a move

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.170 
Pokemon you're gonna select use a move
and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.270> use<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.650> but<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> takes<00:01:08.070> four<00:01:08.880> taps

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and then use it but that takes four taps

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then use it but that takes four taps
on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.840> touchpad<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> tip<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> I'm

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
on the touchpad so the tip that I'm

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.219 
on the touchpad so the tip that I'm
providing<00:01:12.600> today<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
providing today is kind of just to

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.499 
providing today is kind of just to
bypass<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.740> extra<00:01:16.979> tap<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
bypass one extra tap so you go to the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.010 
bypass one extra tap so you go to the
book<00:01:18.659> though<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:20.750> select<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.470> actual<00:01:22.860> disk

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
book though one select the actual disk

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.789 
book though one select the actual disk
to<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.890> select<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.850> move<00:01:27.650> for<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
to you know select the move for you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.300 
to you know select the move for you
already

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
already

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
already
and<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.119> does<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> saves<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.960> an

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and so what that does is it saves you an

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.390 
and so what that does is it saves you an
extra<00:01:32.189> tap<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.810> turn<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.740> makes<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> more

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
extra tap and in turn that makes it more

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
extra tap and in turn that makes it more
efficient<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.119> shiny<00:01:36.390> hunting<00:01:36.600> more

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
efficient and your shiny hunting more

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
efficient and your shiny hunting more
efficient<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:38.909> you're<00:01:39.030> working

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
efficient so let's say you're working

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
efficient so let's say you're working
with<00:01:39.360> twelve<00:01:39.659> taps<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:41.159> takes<00:01:41.430> normally

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
with twelve taps and it takes normally

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
with twelve taps and it takes normally
four<00:01:42.299> taps<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.049> use<00:01:43.500> sweet<00:01:43.710> scent<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.490> only

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
four taps to use sweet scent you're only

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.420 
four taps to use sweet scent you're only
gonna<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.850> food<00:01:45.119> Pokemon<00:01:45.920> whereas<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.310> go

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
gonna see food Pokemon whereas if you go

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.560 
gonna see food Pokemon whereas if you go
ahead<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> use<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.939> method<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> use

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
ahead and use this method and you use

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
ahead and use this method and you use
three<00:01:51.930> taps<00:01:52.140> instead<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.560> four<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.890> gonna

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
three taps instead of four you're gonna

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
three taps instead of four you're gonna
go<00:01:53.130> ahead<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.759> Pokemon<00:01:54.210> within

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
go ahead and see for Pokemon within

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.999 
go ahead and see for Pokemon within
twelve<00:01:55.409> taps

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
twelve taps

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.420 
twelve taps
and<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.659> might<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:57.869> mean<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> lot<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> some

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and so that might not mean a lot to some

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
and so that might not mean a lot to some
people<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.969> you're<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.479> grinding

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
people but if you're out here grinding

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.959 
people but if you're out here grinding
for<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> long<00:02:01.290> time<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.740> shiny<00:02:01.979> hunting<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
