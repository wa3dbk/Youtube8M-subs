how<00:00:09.929> unexpected<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.860> being<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.250> many<00:00:11.429> ways

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
how unexpected it's being in many ways

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.360 
how unexpected it's being in many ways
because<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.389> expected<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.620> much

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
because I expected it to be very much

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.250 
because I expected it to be very much
about<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:15.030> solely<00:00:15.480> concentrating<00:00:15.839> on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
