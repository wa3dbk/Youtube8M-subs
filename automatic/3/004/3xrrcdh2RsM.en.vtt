bunch of slow leaders to attack you yeah
so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.289> shouldn't<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.750> lure

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so you shouldn't really you know lure

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
so you shouldn't really you know lure
them<00:00:55.320> away<00:00:55.590> until<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.460> three<00:00:57.149> at

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
them away until you have like three at

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
them away until you have like three at
least<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> number<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.219> yeah<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
least that's that's the number so yeah I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
least that's that's the number so yeah I
just<00:00:59.760> decided<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> mess<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just decided to mess around with the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
just decided to mess around with the
Trident<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.329> good<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
Trident and see if I can get good use in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
Trident and see if I can get good use in
the<00:01:03.899> Lance<00:01:04.140> class<00:01:04.589> cuz<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> new

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the Lance class cuz I think the new

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.820 
the Lance class cuz I think the new
Lance<00:01:06.210> class<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.720> pretty<00:01:06.990> awesome<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.619> leaves

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
Lance class is pretty awesome it leaves

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
Lance class is pretty awesome it leaves
you<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.189> vulnerable<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.330> mean<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you really vulnerable but I mean the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
you really vulnerable but I mean the
game<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.350> funner<00:01:10.909> when<00:01:11.909> there's<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> chance

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
game is funner when there's a chance

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
game is funner when there's a chance
that<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:12.900> die<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.619> fun

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that you're gonna die it's not fun

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
that you're gonna die it's not fun
running<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.930> mean<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
running around with you know I mean I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.700 
running around with you know I mean I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.070 
know I'm mad they nerfed a few things
but<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.970> fun<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.840> beat

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
but it's not fun when you can beat

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
but it's not fun when you can beat
everything<00:01:22.560> super<00:01:23.189> easily<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.509> yeah<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.080> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
kind of try and make the game a little

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.190 
kind of try and make the game a little
bit<00:01:27.509> harder

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bit harder

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
bit harder

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
attacked by ten different things you can
pretty<00:01:56.850> much<00:01:56.939> always<00:01:57.240> protect<00:01:57.719> yourself<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
pretty much always protect yourself so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
pretty much always protect yourself so
yeah<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.460> enjoying<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.939> last<00:02:00.180> class

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
yeah I'm really enjoying the last class

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.319

and<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.770> Trident<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.369> its<00:02:02.549> ten<00:02:02.759> damage<00:02:03.149> it's

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and the Trident with its ten damage it's

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.220 
and the Trident with its ten damage it's
a<00:02:03.420> pretty<00:02:03.630> good

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
a pretty good

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.080 
a pretty good
I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.280> pretty<00:02:05.460> good<00:02:05.520> deal<00:02:05.760> I<00:02:06.030> think

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I think it's a pretty good deal I think

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.550 
I think it's a pretty good deal I think
it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.330> pretty<00:02:06.510> good<00:02:06.570> weapon<00:02:06.990> actually<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
it's a pretty good weapon actually so I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
it's a pretty good weapon actually so I
think<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.820> very<00:02:09.030> beginning<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.480> any

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
think at the very beginning of any

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.150 
think at the very beginning of any
playthrough<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.320> should<00:02:10.500> run<00:02:10.680> across<00:02:10.980> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
playthrough you should run across the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.850 
playthrough you should run across the
top<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> map<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.970> look<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> Triton<00:02:13.320> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
top of the map and look for a Triton in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
top of the map and look for a Triton in
one<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> water<00:02:14.640> chests<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> surface

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
