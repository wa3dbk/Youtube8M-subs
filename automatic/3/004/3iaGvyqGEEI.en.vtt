try and spin the boat on the spot

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.349 
try and spin the boat on the spot
and<00:00:35.739> then<00:00:35.859> get<00:00:36.039> set<00:00:36.280> again<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.730> some<00:00:36.910> downwind

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
and then get set again to some downwind

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:45.149 
and then get set again to some downwind
sailing<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.149> we're<00:00:43.329> coming<00:00:43.570> up<00:00:43.749> now<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.289> to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
sailing so we're coming up now to the to

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.919 
sailing so we're coming up now to the to
the<00:00:45.280> windward<00:00:45.460> mark<00:00:45.820> right<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.539> on<00:00:46.659> port

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
the windward mark right to the on port

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.660 
the windward mark right to the on port
tack<00:00:47.199> there's<00:00:47.980> going<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.159> be<00:00:48.219> a<00:00:48.339> bit<00:00:48.519> more

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
tack there's going to be a bit more

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.939 
tack there's going to be a bit more
tricky<00:00:49.030> than<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.359> normal<00:00:49.719> normal<00:00:50.350> barrel<00:00:50.829> way

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
tricky than the normal normal barrel way

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.069 
tricky than the normal normal barrel way
rounding<00:00:51.460> because<00:00:51.609> we've<00:00:51.760> got<00:00:51.879> attack<00:00:52.179> so

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
rounding because we've got attack so

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.959 
rounding because we've got attack so
really<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:53.530> key<00:00:53.710> thing<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:53.979> to<00:00:54.249> do<00:00:54.370> get<00:00:54.609> some

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
really the key thing is to do get some

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.419 
really the key thing is to do get some
of<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.149> controls<00:00:55.629> off<00:00:55.809> early<00:00:56.229> especially<00:00:57.129> a

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
of the controls off early especially a

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.160 
of the controls off early especially a
bit<00:00:57.579> of<00:00:57.699> kick<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:58.300> helps<00:00:58.629> going<00:00:58.960> away<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
bit of kick it just helps going away a

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.829 
bit of kick it just helps going away a
little<00:00:59.409> bit<00:00:59.559> easier<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.179> tighten<00:01:01.449> out<00:01:01.690> on

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
little bit easier then we tighten out on

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.510 
little bit easier then we tighten out on
the<00:01:01.929> low<00:01:02.079> line<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:04.239> hike<00:01:04.510> out<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:05.340> clear<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
the low line we hike out of it clear the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.039 
the low line we hike out of it clear the
sheep<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.469> bear<00:01:08.469> away<00:01:09.509> soon<00:01:10.509> as<00:01:10.659> with<00:01:10.840> more

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
sheep and bear away soon as with more

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.020 
sheep and bear away soon as with more
away<00:01:11.909> kick<00:01:12.909> her<00:01:13.090> off<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:14.680> all<00:01:15.040> off<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.520> little

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
away kick her off out all off a little

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.179 
away kick her off out all off a little
bit<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.240> water<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.619> then<00:01:17.829> really<00:01:18.159> just

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
bit of water and then really just

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.490 
bit of water and then really just
checking<00:01:18.789> what's<00:01:18.969> behind<00:01:19.180> us<00:01:19.539> way<00:01:20.079> to<00:01:20.140> breathe

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
checking what's behind us way to breathe

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.120 
checking what's behind us way to breathe
it<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.979> then<00:01:21.610> we<00:01:21.700> can<00:01:21.880> get<00:01:22.030> settled<00:01:22.299> in<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:23.130> will

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
it and then we can get settled in I will

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.190 
it and then we can get settled in I will
approach<00:01:24.399> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.390> women<00:01:25.689> mark<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
approach in the the women mark on the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.529 
approach in the the women mark on the
starboard<00:01:26.590> lay<00:01:26.770> line<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:27.909> goes<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.270> little

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
starboard lay line it just goes a little

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.069 
starboard lay line it just goes a little
bit<00:01:28.810> more<00:01:29.049> time<00:01:29.289> to<00:01:29.409> where<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.130> get<00:01:30.310> set<00:01:30.520> up

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
bit more time to where we get set up

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.859 
bit more time to where we get set up
coming<00:01:32.079> them<00:01:32.200> off<00:01:32.320> early<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> read<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
coming them off early take a read a

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.359 
coming them off early take a read a
quick<00:01:35.200> look<00:01:35.439> around<00:01:35.469> looks<00:01:35.979> like<00:01:36.130> there's<00:01:36.310> a

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
quick look around looks like there's a

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.859 
quick look around looks like there's a
little<00:01:36.520> bit<00:01:36.700> more<00:01:36.820> pressure<00:01:37.240> out<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
little bit more pressure out to the

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.910 
little bit more pressure out to the
right<00:01:38.079> so<00:01:38.320> we're<00:01:38.439> probably<00:01:38.619> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.859> be

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
right so we're probably going to be

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.130 
right so we're probably going to be
driving<00:01:39.219> early<00:01:39.670> at<00:01:39.729> this<00:01:39.880> one<00:01:40.119> they're<00:01:41.109> really

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
driving early at this one they're really

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.599 
driving early at this one they're really
important<00:01:41.829> we're<00:01:41.920> getting<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.130> kick<00:01:42.310> off

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
important we're getting the kick off

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.580 
important we're getting the kick off
lots<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:44.049> shoots<00:01:44.320> out<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.000> boat<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.380> into

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
lots of shoots out in the boat and into

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.349 
lots of shoots out in the boat and into
a<00:01:47.740> dive<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:51.009> soon<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:51.399> we<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.759> quick<00:01:52.149> look

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
a dive as soon as we can quick look

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.039 
a dive as soon as we can quick look
round<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.810> check<00:01:54.210> wrestle<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.270> controls<00:01:55.780> off

round to check wrestle the controls off

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.120 
round to check wrestle the controls off
