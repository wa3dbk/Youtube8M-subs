just I mean most people know how to file

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.560 
just I mean most people know how to file
masteries<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.730> obvious<00:00:12.120> she's<00:00:12.269> good<00:00:12.480> at

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
masteries it's obvious she's good at

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
masteries it's obvious she's good at
like<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:13.290> missions<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.429> efficient<00:00:14.849> like

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
like do missions that are efficient like

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540 
like do missions that are efficient like
pods<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.540> examples<00:00:16.020> pretty<00:00:16.260> decent<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.369> um

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
pods for examples pretty decent but um

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.529 
pods for examples pretty decent but um
the<00:00:18.510> reason<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> put<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.939> video<00:00:21.150> was

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the reason that I put out that video was

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
the reason that I put out that video was
to<00:00:21.660> show<00:00:21.689> people<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> farm<00:00:22.949> masteries

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to show people how to farm masteries

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
to show people how to farm masteries
that<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.570> frog<00:00:25.320> crap<00:00:25.830> guns<00:00:26.449> like<00:00:27.449> smg's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
that would frog crap guns like smg's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
that would frog crap guns like smg's
which<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.490> stuff<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
which I have here or for stuff that was

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.979 
which I have here or for stuff that was
expensive<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.779> grenades<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.650> rockets<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
expensive like grenades or rockets and

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.170 
expensive like grenades or rockets and
that<00:00:33.989> required<00:00:34.559> wall<00:00:34.920> jumping<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that required wall jumping which is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.740 
that required wall jumping which is
currently<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:37.260> possible<00:00:37.800> anymore<00:00:38.750> because

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
currently not possible anymore because

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
currently not possible anymore because
it<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> patched<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.010> took<00:00:41.190> took<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it was it was patched it took took a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
it was it was patched it took took a
long<00:00:41.670> enough<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.360> patched<00:00:42.600> finally

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
long enough but it was patched finally

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.119 
long enough but it was patched finally
so<00:00:43.820> um<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.020> method<00:00:46.289> itself<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.800> still

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so um but the method itself is still

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
so um but the method itself is still
actually<00:00:47.370> possible<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.390> though<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
actually possible so we even though that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
actually possible so we even though that
method<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.800> outdated<00:00:50.160> Here<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> am

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
method is kind of outdated Here I am

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
method is kind of outdated Here I am
going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.010> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> new<00:00:53.670> way<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to show you the kind of new way to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
going to show you the kind of new way to
do<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> pretty<00:00:55.050> much<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> same

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
do it which is pretty much the same

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
do it which is pretty much the same
thing<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> required<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
thing so what that required was you to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.290 
thing so what that required was you to
basically<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.800> onslaught<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.850> multiplayer

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
basically go on onslaught in multiplayer

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
basically go on onslaught in multiplayer
so<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> spawn<00:01:02.160> cap<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so that there was a spawn cap and then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
so that there was a spawn cap and then
we'll<00:01:03.000> jump<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.750> area<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
we'll jump into this back area and just

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780 
we'll jump into this back area and just
wait<00:01:04.710> until<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:05.640> minutes

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
wait until it's like two minutes

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.289 
wait until it's like two minutes
remaining<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.350> gonna<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.650> um

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
remaining now all you're gonna do is um

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.640 
remaining now all you're gonna do is um
still<00:01:09.299> play<00:01:09.540> multiplayer<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
still play multiplayer because that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
still play multiplayer because that
spawn<00:01:10.890> cap<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> helpful<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.420> helpful<00:01:12.780> for

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
spawn cap is helpful really helpful for

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.550 
spawn cap is helpful really helpful for
surviving<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.659> run<00:01:15.659> around<00:01:15.780> basically

if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> multiplayer<00:01:37.560> then

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
if you don't do it in multiplayer then

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
if you don't do it in multiplayer then
they'll<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.090> keep<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.659> spawning<00:01:39.960> kissing<00:01:40.530> in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
they'll just keep on spawning kissing in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.899 
they'll just keep on spawning kissing in
single-player<00:01:41.340> there's<00:01:41.640> no<00:01:41.820> spawn<00:01:42.360> cap<00:01:43.909> at

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
single-player there's no spawn cap at

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.350 
single-player there's no spawn cap at
least<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.390> onslaught<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> yeah<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.149> big

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
cluster here and that's 60 zombies I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
cluster here and that's 60 zombies I
believe<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> we're

haven't

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
haven't
at<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.280> literally<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.820> doesn't<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.360> any

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
at all it literally it doesn't have any

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.950 
at all it literally it doesn't have any
augments<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.370> just<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
augments on it so I'm just just going to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.500 
augments on it so I'm just just going to
be<00:02:19.110> doing<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.340> show<00:02:20.790> off<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.030> how

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
be doing that to show off just how

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.530 
be doing that to show off just how
effective<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.440> method<00:02:22.500> actually<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
effective this method actually is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.710 
effective this method actually is
because<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.570> mean<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:26.010> red<00:02:26.640> gun<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.510> full

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
because I mean a red gun with with full

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.510 
because I mean a red gun with with full
augments<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.350> way<00:02:28.560> better<00:02:28.770> than<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.070> black<00:02:29.280> gun

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
augments is way better than a black gun

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.730 
augments is way better than a black gun
that's<00:02:29.700> unhooked<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> CM<00:02:30.720> 307<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.530> like

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that's unhooked and the CM 307 is like

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.310 
that's unhooked and the CM 307 is like
it's<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.610> even<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.180> great<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.720> gun<00:02:33.990> anyway

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.730 
can imagine that this method is only
really<00:05:31.500> good<00:05:31.710> for<00:05:32.100> like<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.880> assault<00:05:33.630> I'm<00:05:34.560> not

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.779 
sure if the Pierce on hold the lion has
been<00:05:36.900> fixed<00:05:37.229> but<00:05:37.560> if<00:05:37.740> that's<00:05:37.979> fixed<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:38.580> this

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
been fixed but if that's fixed then this

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.940 
been fixed but if that's fixed then this
will<00:05:38.940> be<00:05:39.030> good<00:05:39.180> for<00:05:39.240> heavy<00:05:39.600> as<00:05:39.720> well<00:05:39.930> but<00:05:40.770> um

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
will be good for heavy as well but um

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.730 
will be good for heavy as well but um
but<00:05:41.789> yeah<00:05:42.020> it's<00:05:43.020> only<00:05:43.140> really<00:05:43.440> good<00:05:43.590> on

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
but yeah it's only really good on

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.159 
but yeah it's only really good on
assault<00:05:44.010> because<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.460> killing<00:05:44.729> spree<00:05:44.970> if<00:05:45.270> you

assault because of killing spree if you

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.170 
assault because of killing spree if you
my<00:05:46.560> eyes<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.190> really<00:05:47.400> need<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.700> way<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:47.910> get

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
my eyes you you really need a way to get

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.300 
my eyes you you really need a way to get
your<00:05:48.270> psi<00:05:48.720> because<00:05:49.110> without<00:05:49.470> Pierce<00:05:49.950> this<00:05:50.130> is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
your psi because without Pierce this is

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:59.750 
your psi because without Pierce this is
really<00:05:50.880> not<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.900> good<00:05:52.050> idea<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:58.680> hold<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.550> line

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
really not a good idea and hold the line

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.580 
really not a good idea and hold the line
since<00:06:00.330> it's<00:06:00.510> so<00:06:00.630> dense<00:06:00.900> hold<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.289> line<00:06:01.410> could

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
since it's so dense hold the line could

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.469 
since it's so dense hold the line could
be<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.710> bit<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:01.950> an<00:06:02.039> issue<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.610> I<00:06:02.639> mean<00:06:02.850> as<00:06:03.389> long

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
and that's how this is good for guns

and that's how this is good for guns
which<00:06:51.360> are<00:06:51.540> bad<00:06:51.920> but<00:06:52.920> I'm<00:06:53.040> yeah<00:06:53.730> it's<00:06:53.910> also

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
which are bad but I'm yeah it's also

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.370 
which are bad but I'm yeah it's also
good<00:06:54.420> for<00:06:54.450> guns<00:06:54.720> which<00:06:54.900> are<00:06:54.990> good<00:06:55.200> but

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
good for guns which are good but

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.990 
good for guns which are good but
expensive<00:06:55.740> as<00:06:56.040> I<00:06:56.160> said<00:06:56.340> before<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:56.760> can<00:06:56.910> just

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
expensive as I said before you can just

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.700 
expensive as I said before you can just
do<00:06:57.150> that<00:06:57.180> exact<00:06:57.750> same<00:06:57.780> thing<00:06:58.170> but<00:06:58.350> I<00:06:58.470> found

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
do that exact same thing but I found

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.560 
do that exact same thing but I found
nothing<00:06:59.190> but<00:06:59.220> grenades<00:06:59.670> or<00:06:59.880> using<00:07:00.150> rockets

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
nothing but grenades or using rockets

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.150 
nothing but grenades or using rockets
and<00:07:00.720> you'll<00:07:00.810> gets<00:07:01.020> you'll<00:07:01.410> get<00:07:01.560> tons<00:07:01.890> of

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
and you'll gets you'll get tons of

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.400 
and you'll gets you'll get tons of
rocket<00:07:02.400> kills<00:07:02.730> or<00:07:02.970> grenade<00:07:03.240> kills<00:07:03.570> without

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
rocket kills or grenade kills without

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.410 
rocket kills or grenade kills without
actually<00:07:04.890> using<00:07:04.920> many<00:07:05.550> rockets<00:07:06.000> or<00:07:06.120> grenades

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
actually using many rockets or grenades

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.500 
actually using many rockets or grenades
and<00:07:06.780> yeah<00:07:07.700> so<00:07:08.700> that<00:07:08.880> is<00:07:09.000> that's<00:07:09.270> how<00:07:09.450> you

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
and yeah so that is that's how you

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.730 
and yeah so that is that's how you
basically<00:07:09.810> um<00:07:10.290> use<00:07:11.190> this<00:07:11.960> spawn<00:07:12.960> cap<00:07:13.230> method

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
basically um use this spawn cap method

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.370 
basically um use this spawn cap method
to<00:07:14.040> to<00:07:14.640> farm<00:07:14.880> masteries<00:07:15.570> in<00:07:15.870> an<00:07:16.050> effective<00:07:16.500> way

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.380 
to to farm masteries in an effective way

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.920 
to to farm masteries in an effective way
economically<00:07:19.380> I<00:07:19.680> mean<00:07:20.220> over<00:07:21.030> time<00:07:21.060> it'll

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
economically I mean over time it'll

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.230 
economically I mean over time it'll
probably<00:07:22.170> not<00:07:22.650> be<00:07:22.920> that<00:07:23.130> amazing<00:07:23.610> but<00:07:23.880> it'll

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
probably not be that amazing but it'll

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.720 
probably not be that amazing but it'll
be<00:07:24.330> easy<00:07:24.660> because<00:07:25.290> of<00:07:25.560> killing<00:07:25.830> spree<00:07:26.040> or<00:07:26.430> hold

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
be easy because of killing spree or hold

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.940 
be easy because of killing spree or hold
the<00:07:26.850> line<00:07:27.000> if<00:07:27.210> you<00:07:27.330> want<00:07:27.450> to<00:07:27.570> go<00:07:27.660> that<00:07:27.810> way<00:07:27.950> and

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
the line if you want to go that way and

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.250 
the line if you want to go that way and
it'll<00:07:29.580> be<00:07:29.640> cheap<00:07:29.940> because<00:07:30.750> you'll<00:07:30.900> be<00:07:30.930> can't

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260 
it'll be cheap because you'll be can't

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.930 
it'll be cheap because you'll be can't
you'll<00:07:31.380> be<00:07:31.500> hitting<00:07:31.740> your<00:07:31.830> pierced<00:07:32.190> caps<00:07:32.640> so

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
you'll be hitting your pierced caps so

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.850 
you'll be hitting your pierced caps so
often<00:07:33.300> you're<00:07:33.570> just<00:07:33.840> making<00:07:34.170> so<00:07:34.350> much<00:07:34.470> advance

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
often you're just making so much advance

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.380 
often you're just making so much advance
you're<00:07:35.100> just<00:07:35.310> taking<00:07:35.490> advantage<00:07:36.180> of<00:07:36.270> your

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.390 
you're just taking advantage of your

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.880 
you're just taking advantage of your
Pierce<00:07:36.690> that<00:07:36.960> is<00:07:37.080> why<00:07:37.200> this<00:07:37.260> is<00:07:37.470> a<00:07:37.620> good

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:37.890 
Pierce that is why this is a good
