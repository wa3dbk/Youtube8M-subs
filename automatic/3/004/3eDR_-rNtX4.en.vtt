piece<00:02:26.920> together<00:02:27.100> over<00:02:27.610> time<00:02:27.820> do<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.690> but

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
piece together over time do that but

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.080 
piece together over time do that but
also<00:02:29.350> can<00:02:29.620> remember<00:02:29.950> remember<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.850> do

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
also can remember remember if you do

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.960 
also can remember remember if you do
that<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.500> wait<00:02:32.709> too<00:02:32.980> long<00:02:33.160> then

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
that technology is going to be too old

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.300 
that technology is going to be too old
so<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.790> don't<00:02:37.180> wait<00:02:37.420> forever<00:02:37.690> because

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
so you know don't wait forever because

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.010 
so you know don't wait forever because
all<00:02:39.310> you'll<00:02:39.490> you'll<00:02:40.000> miss<00:02:40.209> out<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.690> you'll
