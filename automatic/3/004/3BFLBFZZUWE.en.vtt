00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 Just to show the comparison like that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 the galaxy tablet pack reduced the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.559
 that's what it's all about in the end 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340

 and otherwise it was like her 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.080
 Look at the backside 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.630
 to the technical details 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.299
 The ipad app has a cortex a9 single 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.830
 core 1 gigahertz processor a gigabyte 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.959
 random access memory 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.410
 The display has a resolution of 1024 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:18.239
 x 600 support does the tablet 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:21.060
 bluetooth wifi gps umts 16 gb internal 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.489
 flash memory as seen sd card slot 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.780
 and thus still expandable and more 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.489
 32 gigabytes on the front we see here 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.600
 Above a small camera solves too 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.010
 had 0 3 megapixel for video chat 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.950
 I also tried a bit 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.030
 with skype no problem the tablet there 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.410
 nothing stops that works wonderfully 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.190
 once you hit the ball so you too 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.100
 let's see how it runs the display 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.780
 colors are okay as I said resolution 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.410
 1024 x 600 you see it's running right 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.910
 fluent if you just like this one 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.230
 little through 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:14.180
 the thing through scrolls you can see here 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.180
 the tablet comes with android 4.0 point 3 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.900
 a bit of testing it has is now on 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.210
 Factory setting therefore sees now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.310
 actually relatively empty 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.290
 I have everything everyday 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.870
 facebook her pale and so on 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.150
 tested must say there were no hangers 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.750
 No problems with apps strong or anything 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.120
 So on the whole in any case 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 nice little tablet what is currently 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.580
 about 200 euro costs with us and 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.950
 I have to say that you get it 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.840
 allhand alone around two sim 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.420

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.430
