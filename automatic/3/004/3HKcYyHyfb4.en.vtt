00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.959
 very good these guys that such as 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.180
 this is me I'm welcome and welcome to a 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.740
 jerte de ti when one day goes well 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.350
 I always take me lately is 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 leaving a lot I do not leave anything I do not know what 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.640
 as it is or in those that do nothing but 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.650
 complain today when a day is a day 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.810
 well they say things really well that 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.640
 it's good and that 's why it 's alive and one that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.320
 how it is not like it could not be from another 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.239
 way to release new maps in 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.920
 the map of the performance and the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.210
 rendering of not me the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.190
 remastering forgiveness 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.020
 with lacquer 12 because they have already removed the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 patches and is again for me the best 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.970
 weapon to remove the ones that join me as 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.100
 always with the juani bayern is a 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.110
 that in which he did not risk much guys 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.699
 many times we have to see that they are 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.010
 pretty are refusing everywhere and 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.210
 you play it constantly but this 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.739
 that the truth that I did not want to play 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.659
 I just wanted to take it out because I've 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.010
 played very little the new maps lavished 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.870
 and he told me come to realize that 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.879
 we are in a group, let's see if the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.409
 double and good the double did not come missing a 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.820
 little but the enemies left this 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.310
 game and I could not get it out I stayed 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.780
 with another streak of 13 something like that but 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.850
 The truth is that he gets me to take the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.229
 nuclear what in for you so that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.360
 see in this map of the remastering 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.679
 Give me as I said as always 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920
 with gusts of help and with the hard line 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.929
 and one that I try not to risk 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.289
 because many times guys the key is not 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.509
 it's obviously the key is the one that 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.460
 It's never the key to float but the key 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.500
 is not rush either the key is to have 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.030
 head and many times what we have is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.979
 do not play around a lot moving on one side 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.259
 for another killing for that is not necessary 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.490
 or pilla respawn constantly but I 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.300
 mute from one place to another is low 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.880
 confirmed that favors what 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.140
 that enemies that move from a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.700
 side for another that the responder has more 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.320
 variable and therefore the game is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.570
 more dynamic if it had been a domain 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.340
 surely he would have been in all the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.530
 heading in the same area and it would have been 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.150
 much more boring you are going to see that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.400
 effectively what they have done with the 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.870
 tail k-12 has been re- upload 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.970
 re-removing the patches is no longer going 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.340
 from far away when it shoots it kills a lot 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.600
 better both with shelter have touched weapons 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.460
 as for example the tool in which 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.590
 for me now kills a little worse have 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.060
 climbed a lot the piper sends from a distance 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 orality have increased the vision more for 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.080
 me now has more cadence has gone up a 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 the acb jota and little by little they are 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.500
 adding weapons the day they fix the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.070
 knife is already going to be the best of what 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.440
 better and good little by little he likes 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.740
 tad plus the ghost and nothing decided is that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.110
 apart from this I 've started the video 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.640
 saying that many things have come out today 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.620
 Well nothing to just tell you that I have 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.020
 I've been playing quite some time today but 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 just to tell you that I got six 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.400
 games and that the six are with weapons 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.470
 different already with that and us 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.670
 you have to imagine that I have 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.560
 I was able to draw and how well I was given 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.960
 today therefore and I am very happy and not 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 I have no reason to complain 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.920
 I'm not going to complain 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.930
 tell you that actually the map of the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.370
 remastering dome the truth that is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.349
 one of the best to take off 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.760
 because as well as for example the map of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.540
 ruins where the streak of the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.340
 predator is a bit or not a little 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.930
 messy as it is a jungle is not like a 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.989
 jungle and enemies it's hard to see them 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.709
 they leave much to desire the truth between 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.079
 This map map of junk 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.420
 of the ship are the best collision 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.760
 true therefore it is good to be removed 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.739
 that controlling as you know the backup 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.209
 I always move around this area it's not that 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.040
 Obviously you already know that no 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.359
 I like to go up you want to camp but they are 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.879
 whom more tactics playing with more 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.129
 head apart from that I hope you like it 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.290
 has served yesterday of the spots of the call of 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.639
 duty co if you liked it, I will continue 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.620
 rising more the next will be in the 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.000
 black you two and I want to go back to 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.950
 normality again in the channel that is 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.689
 what I always want then this 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.220
 week will surely be in the mode of 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.340
 game launch zone because I do not 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.200
 premiered 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 the launch zone mode with the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.290
 sniper in a new episode of no 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.540
 I'm searching because you have not had it for a long time 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.489
 if wrong this world is asking you 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.360
 apart from that then league mode and apart from 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.099
 that temps more camps game good I do not 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.690
 I pick here 12 in this case if not but 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.830
 I could take it out on the different map but 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.780
 I do not usually catch the calcination and 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.220
 bayern I'm going to get me out that is that this is 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.720
 me the game more I tried to take out that my 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.360
 different game so you can enjoy it and 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.359
 pay attention to me that this week on Thursday 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.910
 you are going to have a good one and an example 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.680
 you will like it, you should listen to me 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.479
 I really do not have to tell you either 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.830
 much more the game simply what 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.510
 you are seeing you are already seeing that as 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.580
 I have already said many times on one side to 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.400
 other but that does not take away for me any 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.720
 merit because I can get my skin 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.669
 as always when I wear a hard line 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.620
 I take it out much earlier because I give many 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.350
 assists me with a run of 22 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.389
 21 so that makes it a lot 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.430
 better little more to say the boys 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.919
 simply what I always hope that you 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.419
 I liked the game I hope that you 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.889
 have liked the premiere of the least 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.229
 new maps so this week we have 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.300
 a lot of fuss so I hope we 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.130
 you fail to commit to seeing my videos 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.120
 once more times by the 6000 and we're going to 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.120
 for the 7,000 fast 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.449
 I think you have to give it hard that I have 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.930
 as always continue to keep it 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.669
 the joy of my comments telling me 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.889
 to get the best possible things 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.389
 so that this channel goes well so that 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.010
 I can help you with those guides how 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.840
 improve in the call of duty all the 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.580
 general guys I said I like the 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.000
 live video favorites and see you tomorrow 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.000
 see you later
