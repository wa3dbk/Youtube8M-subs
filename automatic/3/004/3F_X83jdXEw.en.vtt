put it all together

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.820 
put it all together
what<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:14.000> mean<00:02:14.090> by<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> lot<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
what I mean by that is so a lot of the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.220 
what I mean by that is so a lot of the
elite<00:02:16.070> players<00:02:16.310> they<00:02:16.490> really<00:02:16.790> only<00:02:16.820> run<00:02:17.240> if

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
elite players they really only run if

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.930 
elite players they really only run if
you<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> couple<00:02:18.800> different<00:02:19.070> plays<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.910> know

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
you a couple different plays you know

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.390 
you a couple different plays you know
you'd<00:02:20.120> say<00:02:20.270> money<00:02:20.480> place<00:02:20.690> usually<00:02:21.370> they<00:02:22.370> don't

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
you'd say money place usually they don't

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.830 
you'd say money place usually they don't
run<00:02:22.670> too<00:02:22.940> many<00:02:23.120> different<00:02:23.330> formations<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
run too many different formations you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.360 
run too many different formations you
know<00:02:23.930> they<00:02:24.050> no<00:02:24.230> huddle<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.680> they'll<00:02:25.250> have

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
know they no huddle and they'll have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.070 
know they no huddle and they'll have
like<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.520> second<00:02:25.970> or<00:02:26.060> maybe<00:02:26.330> third<00:02:26.570> formation

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
like a second or maybe third formation

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.720 
like a second or maybe third formation
they<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.590> mess<00:02:28.130> around<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.490> but<00:02:28.580> they

they like to mess around with but they

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.490 
they like to mess around with but they
have<00:02:28.850> their<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.180> base<00:02:29.360> play<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.290> build

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
have their one base play and they build

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.020 
have their one base play and they build
everything<00:02:30.710> around<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.190> base<00:02:31.370> ever<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
everything around that base ever you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.460 
everything around that base ever you
build<00:02:32.240> everything<00:02:32.450> around<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.960> base<00:02:33.170> play

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
build everything around that base play

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.130 
build everything around that base play
and<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:34.880> example<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.360> guy<00:02:35.630> his<00:02:35.900> base

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
and for example like this guy his base

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
and for example like this guy his base
play<00:02:36.380> he<00:02:36.620> does<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.770> really<00:02:36.830> good<00:02:37.040> job<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.280> he<00:02:37.910> has

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
play he does a really good job of he has

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180 
play he does a really good job of he has
the<00:02:38.150> FL<00:02:38.390> screen<00:02:38.720> that's<00:02:39.650> another<00:02:39.890> just

the FL screen that's another just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.860 
the FL screen that's another just
makeshift<00:02:40.970> screen<00:02:41.240> how<00:02:41.360> do<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.720> was

corners and goes I'm pretty sure it was
called<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:03.860> he<00:03:03.920> does<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.370> he<00:03:04.400> just

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
called and but what he does is he just

called and but what he does is he just
masters<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.330> play<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.720> lot<00:03:05.930> of

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
masters that one play like a lot of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.080 
masters that one play like a lot of
people<00:03:06.050> know<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.920> terminology<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.880> like

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
people know that the terminology of like

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.390 
people know that the terminology of like
you<00:03:08.300> know<00:03:08.330> like<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:09.380> know<00:03:09.410> FL<00:03:09.860> screen<00:03:10.160> pass

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
you know like you know FL screen pass

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.070 
you know like you know FL screen pass
but<00:03:10.670> there's<00:03:11.090> little<00:03:11.420> things<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.690> he<00:03:11.900> does

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
but there's little things that he does

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.170 
but there's little things that he does
to<00:03:12.320> make<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.980> display<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.760> much<00:03:13.910> better

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
to make this display that much better

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.960 
to make this display that much better
for<00:03:14.660> example<00:03:15.050> he<00:03:15.650> when<00:03:16.310> he<00:03:16.370> hikes<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.700> ball<00:03:16.730> he

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
for example he when he hikes the ball he

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.210 
for example he when he hikes the ball he
moves<00:03:17.210> over<00:03:17.360> with<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.410> with<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.650> screen<00:03:19.040> pass

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
moves over with the with the screen pass

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.970 
moves over with the with the screen pass
which<00:03:19.520> takes<00:03:19.820> away<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.900> quarterback<00:03:21.560> contained

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
which takes away a quarterback contained

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.820 
which takes away a quarterback contained

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
keep it a seven-point game and keep the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.410 
keep it a seven-point game and keep the
pressure<00:04:52.250> on<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.670> know<00:04:52.730> if<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.180> want<00:04:53.360> to

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
pressure on that you know if you want to

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.180 
pressure on that you know if you want to
go<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.660> two<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:54.020> i<00:04:54.140> can<00:04:54.320> get<00:04:54.440> 2.2<00:04:54.800> work<00:04:54.980> as

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
go for two I can i can get 2.2 work as

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.980 
go for two I can i can get 2.2 work as
well<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:56.030> know<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.180> think<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.660> two-point

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
well you know I think the two-point

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.440 
well you know I think the two-point
conversion<00:04:57.320> ISM<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:58.040> fact<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.850> tactic<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
conversion ISM is a fact of tactic I

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.080 
conversion ISM is a fact of tactic I
don't<00:04:59.870> think<00:04:59.900> it's<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.260> cheesy<00:05:00.500> thing<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.830> do

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
don't think it's the cheesy thing to do

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.730 
don't think it's the cheesy thing to do
hit<00:05:02.090> uh<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.720> know<00:05:02.840> yes<00:05:03.110> that's<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.560> sole

hit uh you know yes that's the sole

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.680 
hit uh you know yes that's the sole
reason<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:04.130> believe<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.640> probably<00:05:05.360> end<00:05:05.630> up

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
reason I believe that probably end up

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.390 
reason I believe that probably end up
