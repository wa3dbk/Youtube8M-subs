nearly everyone has seen episode 3 by
this<00:01:37.090> point<00:01:37.300> so<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.630> don't<00:01:37.869> really<00:01:37.990> feel<00:01:38.110> like<00:01:38.290> I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
this point so I don't really feel like I

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.830 
this point so I don't really feel like I
need<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.830> cover<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.220> plot<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:39.850> plus<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
need to cover the plot here plus the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.870 
need to cover the plot here plus the
game<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.200> sort<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.650> beat'em<00:01:42.009> up<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:42.550> plot

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
game is sort of a beat'em up and so plot

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.420 
game is sort of a beat'em up and so plot
is<00:01:43.060> really<00:01:43.390> secondary<00:01:43.990> at<00:01:44.200> best<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:45.250> what<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
is really secondary at best but what I

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.460 
is really secondary at best but what I
do<00:01:45.550> want<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.150> look<00:01:46.240> at<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.630> if<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.900> game<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.229> any

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
do want to look at is if the game is any

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.680 
do want to look at is if the game is any
fun<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:48.070> don't<00:01:48.580> particularly<00:01:48.970> care<00:01:49.420> if<00:01:49.570> it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
fun I don't particularly care if it

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.270 
fun I don't particularly care if it
follows<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.170> story<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> film<00:01:50.860> or

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
follows the story of the film or

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.370 
follows the story of the film or
anything<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:52.960> want<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.229> have<00:01:53.350> a

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
anything like that I just want to have a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.889 
anything like that I just want to have a
good<00:01:53.619> time<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.490> with<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.910> mind<00:01:54.940> let's<00:01:55.720> get

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
good time so with that in mind let's get

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.469 
good time so with that in mind let's get
into<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.369> said<00:01:57.430> earlier<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.180> game<00:01:58.330> is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
into it like I said earlier the game is

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.210 
into it like I said earlier the game is
a<00:01:58.509> side-scrolling<00:01:58.840> beat-em-up<00:01:59.410> except

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
a side-scrolling beat-em-up except

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.860 
a side-scrolling beat-em-up except
unlike<00:02:00.399> most<00:02:00.759> beat'em<00:02:01.119> ups<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.509> get<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.780> have

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
unlike most beat'em ups you get to have

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.170 
unlike most beat'em ups you get to have
a<00:02:01.930> weapon<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> whole<00:02:02.560> time<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.640> case<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
a weapon the whole time in this case the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.120 
a weapon the whole time in this case the
lightsaber<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.350> game<00:02:05.500> played<00:02:05.710> very

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
lightsaber the game played very

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.940 
lightsaber the game played very
similarly<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.790> TMNT<00:02:07.390> for<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> GBA<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.470> it's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
similarly to TMNT for the GBA and it's

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.830 
similarly to TMNT for the GBA and it's
no<00:02:09.100> coincidence<00:02:09.310> since<00:02:09.940> boats<00:02:10.269> games<00:02:10.510> are

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
no coincidence since boats games are

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.900 
no coincidence since boats games are
made<00:02:10.989> by<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.200> same<00:02:11.320> team<00:02:11.890> over<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.400> Ubisoft

Montreal<00:02:13.590> TMNT<00:02:14.590> came<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.130> about<00:02:15.400> two<00:02:15.700> years

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
Montreal TMNT came out about two years

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.789 
Montreal TMNT came out about two years
after<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.480> game<00:02:16.690> though<00:02:16.900> which<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.560> weird

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
after this game though which is weird

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.860 
after this game though which is weird
because<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.519> game<00:02:18.670> has<00:02:18.910> two<00:02:19.150> player<00:02:19.390> support

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because this game has two player support

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.710 
because this game has two player support
and<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.470> game<00:02:20.650> didn't<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.340> whatever<00:02:22.000> you'll

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and that game didn't but whatever you'll

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360 
and that game didn't but whatever you'll
start<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.200> game<00:02:23.380> as<00:02:23.560> either<00:02:23.709> Anakin<00:02:24.250> or

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
start the game as either Anakin or

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.890 
start the game as either Anakin or
obi-wan<00:02:24.400> which<00:02:25.390> character<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.780> choose

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
obi-wan which character you choose

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
obi-wan which character you choose
decides<00:02:26.530> which<00:02:26.769> part<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> story<00:02:27.489> you'll

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
decides which part of the story you'll

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.759 
decides which part of the story you'll
see<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:28.959> back<00:02:29.170> through<00:02:29.380> as<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.650> other

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
see you can go back through as the other

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.590 
see you can go back through as the other
character<00:02:30.250> though<00:02:30.400> at<00:02:30.549> any<00:02:30.700> time<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
character though at any time so you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360

are<00:02:55.090> good<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> thought<00:02:55.959> being<00:02:56.230> Anakin<00:02:56.709> was

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
are good but I thought being Anakin was

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190 
are good but I thought being Anakin was
a<00:02:56.890> little<00:02:57.190> bit<00:02:57.310> easier<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.959> said<00:02:59.019> earlier

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
a little bit easier as I said earlier

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 
a little bit easier as I said earlier
the<00:02:59.650> game<00:02:59.799> was<00:02:59.950> made<00:03:00.100> by<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.340> same<00:03:00.430> people<00:03:00.790> who

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the game was made by the same people who

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.630 
the game was made by the same people who
did<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.360> TMNT<00:03:01.840> game<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.590> GBA<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
did the TMNT game for the GBA and the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.220 
did the TMNT game for the GBA and the
look<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.940> sound<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.330> very<00:03:04.480> similar<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.019> that

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
look and sound is very similar to that

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.690 
look and sound is very similar to that

the<00:03:06.209> art<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.510> pretty<00:03:06.690> cool<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.379> chose<00:03:07.620> to

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
the art is pretty cool and they chose to

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.380 
the art is pretty cool and they chose to
make<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> characters<00:03:08.340> more<00:03:08.580> cartoonish<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
make the characters more cartoonish and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.880 
make the characters more cartoonish and
not<00:03:09.599> have<00:03:09.780> them<00:03:09.900> look<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.410> actors<00:03:10.769> that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
not have them look like the actors that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.979 
not have them look like the actors that
play<00:03:11.069> them<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.459> films<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.840> like

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.420 
play them in the films I really like
this<00:03:13.140> choice<00:03:13.379> because<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.769> hate<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.129> movie

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
this choice because I hate when movie

this choice because I hate when movie
games<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.910> take<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> still<00:03:15.480> shot<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
games just take a still shot of the

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.990 
games just take a still shot of the
movie<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.860> throw<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.640> corner

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
movie and then throw it up in the corner

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
movie and then throw it up in the corner
it<00:03:18.569> always<00:03:18.870> looks<00:03:19.080> awful<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> way<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.010> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
it always looks awful that way and this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.790 
it always looks awful that way and this
is<00:03:20.489> much<00:03:20.670> nicer<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.599> music<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.080> also<00:03:22.620> very

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
is much nicer the music is also very

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.400 
is much nicer the music is also very
similar<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.280> TMNT<00:03:23.819> some<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.900> songs<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.319> of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
similar to TMNT some of the songs are of

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.530 
similar to TMNT some of the songs are of
course<00:03:25.650> taken<00:03:26.069> right<00:03:26.250> from<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.550> movie<00:03:26.880> but

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
course taken right from the movie but

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.110 
course taken right from the movie but
those<00:03:28.050> sound<00:03:28.319> kind<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.650> weak<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.130> GBA<00:03:29.430> they

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
those sound kind of weak on the GBA they

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.970 
those sound kind of weak on the GBA they
did<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.390> best<00:03:30.420> they<00:03:30.630> could<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.380> GBA<00:03:31.680> just

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
did the best they could but the GBA just

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
did the best they could but the GBA just
wasn't<00:03:32.280> made<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.430> full<00:03:32.940> orchestral<00:03:33.330> scores

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
wasn't made for full orchestral scores

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.080 
wasn't made for full orchestral scores
the<00:03:34.620> original<00:03:35.069> tracks<00:03:35.340> sound<00:03:35.549> pretty<00:03:35.879> good

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the original tracks sound pretty good

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.550 
the original tracks sound pretty good
though<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.450> they<00:03:36.780> make<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.080> most<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
though and they make up most of the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620 
though and they make up most of the
games<00:03:37.739> music<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.459> it's<00:03:38.880> pretty<00:03:39.120> good<00:03:39.360> overall

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
games music so it's pretty good overall

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
the controls in this game are definitely

the controls in this game are definitely

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
button is the most complicated part

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.819

because<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.630> hold<00:03:54.870> our<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.410> then<00:03:55.560> press<00:03:55.799> a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
one of your powers it seems a little

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.880 
one of your powers it seems a little
clunky<00:04:00.510> at<00:04:00.599> first<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.110> by<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.440> end<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.769> worked

clunky at first but by the end it worked

really<00:04:02.250> well<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.880> also<00:04:03.540> wanted<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.959> talk<00:04:04.170> about

really well I also wanted to talk about

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.900 
really well I also wanted to talk about
the<00:04:04.530> blocking<00:04:04.950> because<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.670> block

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the blocking because you can block

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.940 
the blocking because you can block
normal<00:04:06.299> attacks<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.110> real<00:04:07.290> fun<00:04:07.560> part<00:04:07.799> is

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
normal attacks but the real fun part is

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.350 
normal attacks but the real fun part is
blocking<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.430> lasers<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.030> shooting<00:04:09.299> them

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
blocking the lasers and shooting them

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.449 
blocking the lasers and shooting them
back<00:04:09.569> at<00:04:09.720> your<00:04:09.840> opponent<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.190> fun

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
back at your opponent it's a really fun

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.069 
back at your opponent it's a really fun
game<00:04:11.639> mechanic<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.269> even<00:04:12.660> though<00:04:12.750> it's<00:04:12.900> been

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
game mechanic and even though it's been

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.960 
game mechanic and even though it's been
in<00:04:13.230> other<00:04:13.410> star<00:04:13.709> wars<00:04:13.920> games<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.340> think<00:04:14.850> this

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
in other star wars games I think this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.029 
in other star wars games I think this
one<00:04:15.120> does<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.420> really<00:04:15.600> well<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:16.560> easy<00:04:16.859> to

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
one does it really well it's easy to

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.979 
one does it really well it's easy to
time<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.579> it's<00:04:17.760> even<00:04:17.910> required<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.630> beat<00:04:18.780> some

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
time and it's even required to beat some

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.590 
time and it's even required to beat some
of<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.169> smaller<00:04:19.410> bosses<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.510> speaking<00:04:21.510> of

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
of the smaller bosses and speaking of

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600 
of the smaller bosses and speaking of
bosses<00:04:21.780> every<00:04:22.530> three<00:04:22.770> levels<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.400> you'll

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
bosses every three levels or so you'll

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550 
bosses every three levels or so you'll
have<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.850> fight<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> big<00:04:24.450> boss<00:04:24.690> they're<00:04:25.320> always

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
have to fight a big boss they're always

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.320 
have to fight a big boss they're always
a<00:04:25.710> Jedi<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.220> some<00:04:26.400> kind<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.090> don't<00:04:27.210> just

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
a Jedi of some kind and you don't just

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.490 
a Jedi of some kind and you don't just
get<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.690> fight<00:04:27.900> them<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.320> would<00:04:28.350> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
get to fight them like you would a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.469 
get to fight them like you would a
normal<00:04:28.560> enemy<00:04:29.130> instead<00:04:29.880> you're<00:04:30.180> sort<00:04:30.419> of

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
normal enemy instead you're sort of

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.300 
normal enemy instead you're sort of
locked<00:04:30.690> into<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.960> 2d<00:04:31.350> plane<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.039> have<00:04:32.190> to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
locked into a 2d plane and you have to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.860 
locked into a 2d plane and you have to
block<00:04:32.520> either<00:04:32.820> high<00:04:33.060> or<00:04:33.090> low<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.660> then

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
block either high or low and then

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.200 
block either high or low and then
counter-attack<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:35.310> can<00:04:35.460> also<00:04:35.610> use<00:04:35.729> force

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
counter-attack you can also use force

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.610 
counter-attack you can also use force
powers<00:04:36.570> but<00:04:36.840> they're<00:04:36.990> not<00:04:37.139> very<00:04:37.289> effective

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
powers but they're not very effective

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.140 
powers but they're not very effective
against<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.160> Jedi<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.520> you're<00:04:38.880> better<00:04:39.060> off

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
against the Jedi so you're better off

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.969 
against the Jedi so you're better off
just<00:04:39.419> blocking<00:04:39.780> their<00:04:40.050> powers<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.440> waiting

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
just blocking their powers and waiting

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.190 
just blocking their powers and waiting
to<00:04:41.100> strike<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:42.180> sort<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.630> paper<00:04:42.930> rock

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
to strike it's sort of a paper rock

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200 
to strike it's sort of a paper rock
scissors<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:44.310> wait<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.639> see<00:04:44.789> if<00:04:44.880> they'll<00:04:45.060> go

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
scissors you wait to see if they'll go

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.719 
scissors you wait to see if they'll go
high<00:04:45.600> low<00:04:46.050> or<00:04:46.289> use<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> fourth<00:04:46.919> power<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.520> then

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
high low or use a fourth power and then

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.250 
high low or use a fourth power and then
you<00:04:47.880> immediately<00:04:48.000> have<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.810> do<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> proper

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
you immediately have to do the proper

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.100 
you immediately have to do the proper
counter<00:04:49.970> usually<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.000> don't<00:04:51.300> like<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.630> bosses

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
counter usually I don't like the bosses

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.270 
counter usually I don't like the bosses
and<00:04:52.320> beat<00:04:52.470> em<00:04:52.620> ups<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.919> have<00:04:53.039> their<00:04:53.250> own

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
and beat em ups to have their own

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.219 
and beat em ups to have their own
separate<00:04:53.760> gameplay<00:04:54.210> mechanic<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.139> this

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
separate gameplay mechanic but in this

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.540 
separate gameplay mechanic but in this
case<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.620> thought<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.889> was<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.010> cool<00:04:56.250> way<00:04:56.520> to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
case I thought it was a cool way to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.610 
case I thought it was a cool way to
simulate<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.300> more<00:04:57.450> epic<00:04:57.810> Jedi<00:04:58.229> on<00:04:58.380> Jedi

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
simulate the more epic Jedi on Jedi

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.770 
simulate the more epic Jedi on Jedi
battles<00:04:59.099> plus<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.060> mixed<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.360> up<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.539> little<00:05:00.690> bit

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
battles plus it mixed it up a little bit

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.600 
battles plus it mixed it up a little bit
since<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.289> rest<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.710> game<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:02.010> basically

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
since the rest of the game is basically

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.760 
since the rest of the game is basically
a<00:05:02.639> straight-up<00:05:02.970> brawler<00:05:03.360> well<00:05:04.260> it's<00:05:04.590> not

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
a straight-up brawler well it's not

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.860 
a straight-up brawler well it's not
entirely<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.340> brawler<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.940> tries<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.300> add<00:05:06.539> some

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
entirely a brawler it tries to add some

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870 
entirely a brawler it tries to add some
small<00:05:07.260> bits<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.680> platforming<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.639> kind<00:05:08.820> of

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
small bits of platforming but it kind of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.210 
small bits of platforming but it kind of
felt<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.180> Double<00:05:09.810> Dragon<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:10.440> where<00:05:11.130> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
felt like Double Dragon here where the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.010 
felt like Double Dragon here where the
platforming<00:05:11.700> was<00:05:11.849> added<00:05:12.240> after<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.599> controls

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
platforming was added after the controls

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.839 
platforming was added after the controls
had<00:05:13.200> already<00:05:13.320> been<00:05:13.560> set<00:05:13.860> there<00:05:14.520> aren't<00:05:14.640> any

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
had already been set there aren't any

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.640 
had already been set there aren't any
death<00:05:15.090> traps<00:05:15.419> or<00:05:15.599> anything<00:05:15.930> but<00:05:16.260> sometimes

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
death traps or anything but sometimes

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.060 
death traps or anything but sometimes
you<00:05:16.770> have<00:05:16.860> to

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
you have to

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.860 
you have to
jump<00:05:17.220> over<00:05:17.430> fire<00:05:17.670> something<00:05:18.330> with<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.510> machine

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
jump over fire something with a machine

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.070 
jump over fire something with a machine
chasing<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:20.280> feels<00:05:20.310> very<00:05:20.850> awkward

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
chasing you and it feels very awkward

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.540 
chasing you and it feels very awkward
it's<00:05:22.080> only<00:05:22.350> in<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.530> game<00:05:22.680> about<00:05:22.830> twice<00:05:23.250> per

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
it's only in the game about twice per

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.860 
it's only in the game about twice per
character<00:05:23.850> but<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.360> thought<00:05:24.540> those<00:05:24.750> were

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
character but I thought those were

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.500 
character but I thought those were
definitely<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.560> weakest<00:05:25.890> parts<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.310> game

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
definitely the weakest parts of the game

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.030 
definitely the weakest parts of the game
the<00:05:27.510> one<00:05:27.780> thing<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.080> helps<00:05:28.470> give<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.830> game

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
the one thing that helps give this game

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
at the end of each stage it adds them up

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.750 
at the end of each stage it adds them up

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
attack power it's a pretty simple system

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.740 
attack power it's a pretty simple system
but<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:56.700> does<00:05:56.910> make<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.390> little<00:05:57.420> more

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
but it does make it a little more

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.750 
but it does make it a little more

gems<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:04.350> game<00:06:04.530> can<00:06:04.830> be<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:05.100> little

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
gems the game can be a little

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.220 
gems the game can be a little
repetitious<00:06:06.000> at<00:06:06.180> times<00:06:06.420> but<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.780> still<00:06:07.050> thought

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
repetitious at times but I still thought

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.560 
repetitious at times but I still thought
it<00:06:07.290> was<00:06:07.470> really<00:06:07.800> fun<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.910> was<00:06:09.060> also<00:06:09.420> released

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
it was really fun it was also released

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.600 
it was really fun it was also released
on<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.960> d/s<00:06:10.260> with<00:06:10.500> some<00:06:10.680> added<00:06:10.830> flying<00:06:11.250> levels

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
on the d/s with some added flying levels

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.550 
on the d/s with some added flying levels
to<00:06:11.730> help<00:06:11.880> break<00:06:12.090> that<00:06:12.150> up<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.170> also<00:06:13.290> had

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
to help break that up and it also had

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.290 
to help break that up and it also had
touchscreen<00:06:13.980> control<00:06:14.430> but<00:06:14.760> other<00:06:15.060> than<00:06:15.240> that

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
touchscreen control but other than that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.660 
touchscreen control but other than that
the<00:06:15.570> two<00:06:15.750> versions<00:06:16.140> are<00:06:16.290> identified<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:17.580> the

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
the two versions are identified in the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.610 
the two versions are identified in the
end<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.150> think<00:06:18.420> this<00:06:18.510> game<00:06:18.690> can<00:06:18.930> be<00:06:18.960> fun<00:06:19.320> for

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
end I think this game can be fun for

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.280 
end I think this game can be fun for
even<00:06:19.920> a<00:06:20.010> casual<00:06:20.370> Star<00:06:20.700> Wars<00:06:20.910> fan<00:06:21.150> like<00:06:21.360> me<00:06:21.570> it's

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
even a casual Star Wars fan like me it's

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.840 
even a casual Star Wars fan like me it's
not<00:06:22.380> too<00:06:22.620> hard<00:06:22.890> and<00:06:23.040> it<00:06:23.130> has<00:06:23.310> some<00:06:23.520> pretty<00:06:23.670> good

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
not too hard and it has some pretty good

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.360 
not too hard and it has some pretty good
controls<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:25.140> is<00:06:25.230> kind<00:06:25.470> of<00:06:25.560> short<00:06:25.740> but<00:06:26.100> you<00:06:26.190> can

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
controls it is kind of short but you can

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.890 
controls it is kind of short but you can
play<00:06:26.550> through<00:06:26.730> it<00:06:26.880> as<00:06:27.000> both<00:06:27.210> characters<00:06:27.570> with

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
play through it as both characters with

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.510 
play through it as both characters with
totally<00:06:28.320> different<00:06:28.350> levels<00:06:28.890> so<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.130> think<00:06:29.220> that

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
totally different levels so I think that

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.850 
totally different levels so I think that
helps<00:06:29.760> it<00:06:29.880> a<00:06:29.940> lot<00:06:30.120> if<00:06:30.810> you're<00:06:31.050> into<00:06:31.230> 2d<00:06:31.440> beat'em

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
helps it a lot if you're into 2d beat'em

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.740 
helps it a lot if you're into 2d beat'em
ups<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.700> have<00:06:32.850> even<00:06:33.000> a<00:06:33.150> passing<00:06:33.360> interest

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
ups and you have even a passing interest

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.690 
ups and you have even a passing interest
in<00:06:34.050> Star<00:06:34.320> Wars<00:06:34.560> I<00:06:34.920> think<00:06:35.340> you're<00:06:35.460> gonna<00:06:35.580> really

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700
