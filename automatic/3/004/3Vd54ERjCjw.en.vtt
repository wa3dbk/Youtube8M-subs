00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
anything so far and the hope seems to be

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
anything so far and the hope seems to be
dwindling<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> find

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

dwindling that they are going to find
any<00:00:58.859> survivors<00:00:59.670> now<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> focus<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
any survivors now so the focus is it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
any survivors now so the focus is it
seems<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.309> moving<00:01:02.789> towards<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> the

the ship and the way that it the way
that<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> sank<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.210> has<00:01:18.990> been<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> focus<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that it sank is has been the focus of a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.440 
that it sank is has been the focus of a
lot<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> questions

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
lot of questions

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
lot of questions
and<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> lot<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> speculation<00:01:22.850> but<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.060> think

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and a lot of speculation but I think

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.020 
and a lot of speculation but I think
that<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> moment<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.229> rescue<00:01:25.500> operation

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
that at the moment this rescue operation

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530 
that at the moment this rescue operation
has<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.360> supposed<00:01:28.229> wrapped<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.450> about

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
has I supposed wrapped up now what about

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
has I supposed wrapped up now what about
the<00:01:30.810> relatives<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> victims<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.130> it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the relatives of the victims here it's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
the relatives of the victims here it's
really<00:01:32.460> difficult<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.000> imagine<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.600> they

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really difficult to imagine what they

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
really difficult to imagine what they
must<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.259> through<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.829> now<00:01:35.009> what

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
must be going through right now what

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.039
