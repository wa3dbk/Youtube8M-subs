that irritates me and I feel like this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
that irritates me and I feel like this
is<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.550> point<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.239> irritate<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
is a point that would irritate a lot of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.679 
is a point that would irritate a lot of
people<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.100> clock<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> pen<00:01:05.689> skips

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
people is the clock on the pen skips

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.090 
people is the clock on the pen skips
time<00:01:07.850> very<00:01:08.850> frequently<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:11.010> instance

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
time very frequently so for instance

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
time very frequently so for instance
okay<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.850> let<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.900> catch<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
okay so let me see what I can catch this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
okay so let me see what I can catch this
on<00:01:13.830> film<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.820> happens<00:01:15.060> frequently<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
on film that happens frequently so you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.399 
on film that happens frequently so you
can<00:01:15.990> probably<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.409> I'll<00:01:18.049> get<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.110> into

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
can probably do it I'll get it into

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:29.090 
can probably do it I'll get it into
recording<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:27.049> okay<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.229> recording<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
recording so okay it's recording so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.819 
recording so okay it's recording so
let's<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.509> wonder<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:33.650> wonder<00:01:34.650> if

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
let's see I wonder if you can wonder if

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.660 
let's see I wonder if you can wonder if
this<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.520> focus<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this thing will focus on the this is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.440 
this thing will focus on the this is
going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.030> pretty<00:01:42.299> crappy<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:45.200> hmm

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
going to be pretty crappy but hmm

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
going to be pretty crappy but hmm
this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.780> working<00:01:49.080> out<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.650> well<00:01:49.830> as<00:01:49.980> I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this is now working out as well as I

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.910 
this is now working out as well as I
thought<00:01:51.980> but<00:01:53.630> well<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.660> don't<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
thought but well I don't know if you I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
thought but well I don't know if you I
guess<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.640> care<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.900> can<00:01:58.080> you'll<00:01:58.350> notice

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
guess really care you can you'll notice

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.520 
guess really care you can you'll notice
but<00:01:59.490> I'll<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> described<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.540> will<00:02:00.870> record

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
but I'll just described it will record

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.860 
but I'll just described it will record
it<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.760> idea<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:03.720> it's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
it the idea is that so when it's

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.580 
it the idea is that so when it's
recording<00:02:04.320> has<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.130> counter<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:07.380> show

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
recording has the the counter to show

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.400 
recording has the the counter to show
you<00:02:07.650> how<00:02:07.920> how<00:02:08.190> much<00:02:08.460> is<00:02:08.730> recorded<00:02:09.410> pretty

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you how how much is recorded pretty

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.600 
you how how much is recorded pretty
standard<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.060> every<00:02:12.060> once<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> while<00:02:13.610> it'll

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
standard but every once in a while it'll

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.350 
standard but every once in a while it'll
skip<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.510> second<00:02:17.180> which<00:02:18.890> isn't<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> whole<00:02:20.360> heck

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
skip a second which isn't a whole heck

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
skip a second which isn't a whole heck
of<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.600> big<00:02:21.780> deal<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.640> problem<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.090> it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
of a big deal but the problem is that it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.030 
of a big deal but the problem is that it
skips<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.960> second<00:02:25.380> basically<00:02:27.560> maybe<00:02:28.560> once<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
skips a second basically maybe once a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
skips a second basically maybe once a
minute<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:35.760> happens<00:02:36.240> i'm<00:02:36.600> pretty

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
minute or so and this happens i'm pretty

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.410 
minute or so and this happens i'm pretty
sure<00:02:37.580> regardless<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.760> whether<00:02:38.940> or<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.180> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
sure regardless of whether or not it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.450 
sure regardless of whether or not it's
in<00:02:39.600> recording<00:02:40.970> mode<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:43.160> basically<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
in recording mode so basically the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.850 
in recording mode so basically the
internal<00:02:45.000> clock<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.690> pen<00:02:46.430> gets<00:02:48.860> really

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
internal clock of the pen gets really

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
internal clock of the pen gets really
far<00:02:50.130> ahead<00:02:50.280> i<00:02:50.460> think<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.820> just<00:02:50.880> happened<00:02:51.300> i

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
far ahead i think it just happened i

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.910 
far ahead i think it just happened i
don't<00:02:51.450> know<00:02:51.600> oh<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.560> happened

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
don't know oh I think it just happened

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.800 
don't know oh I think it just happened
again<00:02:52.980> anyway<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.910> internal<00:02:54.360> clock<00:02:54.540> gets

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
again anyway the internal clock gets

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
again anyway the internal clock gets
ahead<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:57.450> real<00:02:57.959> time<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.640> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
ahead of the of real time and so you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.070 
ahead of the of real time and so you
can't<00:02:59.940> really<00:02:59.970> trust<00:03:00.240> over<00:03:00.450> time<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.870> if

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
can't really trust over time and if

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.440 
can't really trust over time and if
you're<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.740> have<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.450> constantly

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you're going to you have to constantly

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.350 
you're going to you have to constantly
