 ban 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.570
 I can say that 9 schools next to you can move like this 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.340
 This is impossible with iphone 6 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.270
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.270

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.269
 Yes Let's look at the next letter input If it is with iphone 6, it is 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:43.519
 There is no problem at all with this kind of flip nul 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:46.590
 Yes there is no problem with the left child's conversion button will also receive this translation button below this 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:51.450

 English Japanese Chinese You can choose English or even the leftmost old 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:03.830
 It is also possible to operate with one hand that will not reach Sasayama . 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:11.780
 On the other hand + wonder if unwillingly difficult flip input I is in the case of 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.560
 It is hard to reach now the leftmost but it is this kind of state behind 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.400
 is not it 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:24.479
 So What a danger is pretty dangerous this train 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.790
 If you try to have it language conversion is a good idea to stop in the middle not reach to the other because full of tricks 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.290
 Hmm 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:34.620
