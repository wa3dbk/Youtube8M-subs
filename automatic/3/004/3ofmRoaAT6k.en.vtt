00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.490
 line we are in a new world yes sir 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:17.460
 we are in a new way in which you are 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.040
 black lines above it that is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
 They put black and I stay a beautiful plan 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.900
 but it looks like I'm going to get wet and everything 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 wait because it's all I do not know how 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 control the helicopter with the keyboard 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 madryn and the kid well we're in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 a new way in which all the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 map completely flooded and good is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 something that is quite expected that I had 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 really want to see it and I think it 's all 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.999
 is wrong is not everything guanta for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 that these lines that is what they are is 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.949
 this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.499
 this assignment we are going to see or we know and 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.319
 I fall to the water 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.800
 the water in theory is not worth it 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:58.109
 gangplank gaffes your kid maya 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.909
 See what flipante how cool studies 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.379
 we have divided by here good guys 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.870
 Well, that wanted to show you what has 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.470
 come out a new way before 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.000
 the patch rotate or anything else 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530
 because the truth that I thought 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 quite interesting there are sometimes 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.730
 that you do not go through those black lines and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 you do not see anything at all and I think that 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.960
 I'm going to turn around I do not see I do not see 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.450
 absolutely nothing uncle now in theory 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.270
 I will have that now mother looked at the look 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.920
 look people look at cars good 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.470
 guys this is one of the ways that most 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.010
 I liked it in gta iv what 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 I had the hackers in ps3 and me because 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.580
 I really loved investigating 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.530
 and see everything I do not know different from the others 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 no, I loved seeing this 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 flooded because it's like a dream to live it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.790
 now play it because I love that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.670
 they taught him all this let's say that this 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.080
 new motorbike to me as I already told you is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.940
 something that I really wanted to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.979
 show you then if I can go out and see 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.030
 if I can climb up here and I can 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.100
 come out I do not know that I can be here and with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.320
 the mold of flying with superman wait 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.840
 because my mother kid there are times that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.250
 the lines those 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.760
 I was here or the guata fac what but that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.760
 I have to get out of here 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.890
 Okay, I'm standing, I'm standing, I'm standing 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.830
 perfect voucher is theory right now 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 I stand without paying attention to this water 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.120
 because I think it's at the top yes 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.700
 ok I'll put the superman mode to see 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.769
 if I can get out of here 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 I do not see anything my mother are those lines 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.510
 those that do not give you the ones that do not let you 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.950
 move well mother well kid mind me 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.270
 I would like to go to Monte Chilian to see what 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.150
 pass 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.820
 to see how everything is apart from having 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.070
 well there are many types of water 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.320
 true that this is the one that the normal 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.970
 then there is one that is completely water 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.010
 full then it's shorter my mother 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.190
 boy I got caught I think 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.920
 depending on if we have a lot of traffic 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.720
 well all cp is let 's say the cars 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.250
 they do not stop going out and going out and going out to see 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.570
 If I can see it well, I think I 'm going to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.680
 change the time that if you can see 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.410

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.440
 I dropped the thing is that that has 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.660
 downloaded this mode and had many 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.170
 inside under water and waves seriously or 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.420
 behind 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.120
 good guys, that means that 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.660
 there is a mod or this type of mod 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.790
 He really wants to have it because 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.280
 covers a lot of fronts because I 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.769
 I'm dying seriously but weird things 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.890
 I'm serious and this one is 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.580
 doing this 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.530
 because he does with his hands 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.940
 what seriously are you doing uncle 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.980
 favila there is one or if there is a motorbike 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.310
 water a jet ski so what I 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 I want or more 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.000
 and perfect perfect perfect good 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.739
 guys what I wanted to tell you was 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.440
 exactly what this mode had 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.320
 very much wanted to leave because 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.060
 let's say there are quite a few levels of 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.889
 water is not you can put whatever 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.560
 exaggeratedly high water level 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.500
 You can also put whatever is enough 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.760
 shortly so there is no water and no 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.580
 there is absolutely water in which the 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.810
 water level is zero and you can see everything 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.820
 what is under the water we have 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.460
 enough mysteries to solve and 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.580
 I needed this to see what else there was 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.380
 then for example the tanks and all 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.900
 those things that I had then I'm going to see 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.669
 very good because you were with say with 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.700
 the recycler could not see everything well 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.250
 one hundred percent and with this mode that is 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.560
 the tsunami or not water you can see it 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.570
 totally perfect and well let's say that 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.970
 throughout the days I will begin to 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.280
 show you all the mysteries that are 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.410
 under the sea without water then you will see 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.389
 everything perfectly well and well let's say 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.370
 that if we support this video of mods 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.870
 I'll know you like them and I'll upload them to the channel 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.060
 so let's say we have 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.979
 enough mysteries to solve yet 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.430
 sincerely I really want to 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.850
 that 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.190
 and see everything clearly without water there 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.280
 I know you, but I know, so good 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.890
 you want the mystery to rise below the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.440
