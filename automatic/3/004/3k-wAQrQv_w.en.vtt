00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.840
 the good third place is interested in doping not so much sense but 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.339
 the more the way we play soccer 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.459
 down the principal fell after the backlog that the team then 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.489
 once again 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.209
 has really gained and also 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.329
 finally developed on train to the gate 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.689
 Mr. Dive first played for 60 minutes but partially played 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.419
 Unfortunately 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.419
 played too much and play Sweden and too little 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 to achieve the developed goal 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.400
 the Federal Council has the house or Nichtsein back to Friday 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.360
 but then she has her own to call outstanding response 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 and the game deserves to win 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.730
 seriously a lot of knowledge can be played out of such 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.030
 I do not think so 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.719
 but one was certainly today that Marc Ziegler aboard me replaced Roman 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 Weidenfeller again Beck gave his can provide again but another 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 Apparently the guy grabbed back his tempo dribbling last night 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.950
 so invited 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.020
 why good that we can often rely on winners 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.470
 you have to have such an offer 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.170
 around and wants to live the park 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.809
 "It's certainly a good way 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.210
 Dr. 1 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.670
 the game the water wants to look like ten are very hot 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.030
 fast pace out and play on his strengths with it 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.540
 and he has now also in training but has already shown good approaches 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 now in the second half but then I think again a lot 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 Momentum brought Kerine 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.800
 Dylan has now two the Sons with a goal behind them 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.110
 on the heart but there were also phases of the heart 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 in which you personally copied him from Bollig us 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.229
 Of course, with this development we all have a very high percentage 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 dissatisfied and and quarter disappointing for him 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940
 most of all, I believe 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.420
 and as I said who with their restart wells and triggers goes for him 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.820
 actually going on at zero and not at -10 but it gets going at zero 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 but let's see what comes out 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910
 What is your first impression of Jakub Blaszczykowski? 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.110
 German 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.640
 because he can enrich the game 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.330
 In Hessen matters especially the pace is the like or or that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.219
 total package 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.260
 the whole package is a form of footballer and has it 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.309
 already report and speed up on the ball what 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.619
 very good in the pack 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.339
 and also played against the Belgian champions 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.039
 just as far as beer or wine car was not that far and that was in 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.149
 Order is 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.259
 that should be Alba 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.509
 the trend is but team brought 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.839
 Herbert SPD told PiÃ±era 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 what recognition should the game or this 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.809
 w11 delivered 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.089
 Jari important should be a bit careful with BF and so 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.049
 Old squad of preparation 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.239
 we spared the boys 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.709
 played a bit the fair game, but we wanted to do so 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.409
 Training session 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.949
 and percent i just want to see everyone in the picture 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.949
 the individual that everyone also has playground also in training camp 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.879
 I think that's what the smoke and me did 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.920
 who would have played today "I would call you immediately but the kind and 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.919
 Way of running it again 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.659
 that was good though 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.569
 there is news from Alexander free when he comes to the team and 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.870
 maybe my running unit can or will join the Essen Dortmund on 19 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.669
 happen again just like let's go first now 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669
 Bakhtiar two and a half three weeks even here in rehab 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.449
 and then come back to the team then let's have a look 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.269
 whether he has one or the other team he triest unit with the team as well 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:24.510
 beautiful 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.439
 can join in if the program is 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.789
 put the percent that of course everything is also posed 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:31.869
 and percent 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.919
 he makes a good impression in any case 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.769
 I think if everything goes smoothly 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.049
 the percent 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.409
 maybe not to play the first two, but then it has 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.139
 Slowly again high altitude air sniffs around again 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.260
 maybe to be there and how it looks like 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.259
 this addition is an appointment 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.969
 but everything is quiet 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.540
 that means it's hard to come back but they are also sold 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.129
 been 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.560
 who then also to say his word
