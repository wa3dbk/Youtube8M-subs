now what we've done here is we've

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.660 
now what we've done here is we've
employed<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.719> pro<00:00:45.110> master<00:00:45.379> three<00:00:46.219> strand

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
employed a pro master three strand

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.569 
employed a pro master three strand
lowering<00:00:47.600> line<00:00:47.870> up<00:00:48.379> through<00:00:49.160> this<00:00:49.340> natural

lowering line up through this natural

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.850 
lowering line up through this natural
crotch<00:00:50.180> we're<00:00:50.690> going<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:50.870> be<00:00:50.930> taking<00:00:51.260> wraps<00:00:51.530> on

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
crotch we're going to be taking wraps on

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.430 
crotch we're going to be taking wraps on
the<00:00:51.890> tree<00:00:52.340> I've<00:00:53.059> tied<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.660> limb<00:00:53.870> off<00:00:54.050> with<00:00:54.410> a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the tree I've tied the limb off with a

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.970 
the tree I've tied the limb off with a
running<00:00:54.739> bowline<00:00:55.340> now<00:00:56.300> this<00:00:57.140> three<00:00:57.379> strand<00:00:57.739> is

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
running bowline now this three strand is

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.029 
running bowline now this three strand is
a<00:00:58.039> good<00:00:58.489> choice<00:00:59.449> for<00:00:59.899> natural<00:01:00.379> crotch<00:01:00.559> rigging

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
a good choice for natural crotch rigging

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.189 
a good choice for natural crotch rigging
it's<00:01:01.550> much<00:01:01.760> more<00:01:01.969> appropriate<00:01:02.329> than<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.809> double

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
it's much more appropriate than a double

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.980 
it's much more appropriate than a double
braid<00:01:03.440> would<00:01:03.680> be<00:01:04.330> something<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.690> have<00:01:05.720> to

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
braid would be something that we have to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.779 
braid would be something that we have to
remember<00:01:06.320> when<00:01:06.830> we're<00:01:07.039> using<00:01:07.399> a<00:01:07.640> natural

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
remember when we're using a natural

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.029 
remember when we're using a natural
crotch<00:01:08.240> rigging<00:01:08.720> because<00:01:09.320> there's<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.619> lot<00:01:09.890> of

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
crotch rigging because there's a lot of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.310 
crotch rigging because there's a lot of
friction<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.759> here<00:01:11.119> in<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.570> crotch<00:01:11.840> at<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
friction up here in the crotch at the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.920 
friction up here in the crotch at the
rigging<00:01:12.679> point<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.210> means<00:01:14.509> is<00:01:14.750> when

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
rigging point what that means is when

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.580 
rigging point what that means is when
this<00:01:15.049> piece<00:01:15.350> comes<00:01:15.680> over<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.610> lead<00:01:17.330> here<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
this piece comes over the lead here the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.560 
this piece comes over the lead here the
short<00:01:18.950> leg<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.549> rope<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:20.000> going<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.270> take

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
short leg of the rope is going to take

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.179 
short leg of the rope is going to take
bear<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:20.990> lot<00:01:21.259> more<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.680> brunt<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
bear a lot more of the brunt of the

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.390 
bear a lot more of the brunt of the
force<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:23.390> we'll<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.140> fall<00:01:24.380> which<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:24.979> from

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
force then we'll the fall which is from

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.060 
force then we'll the fall which is from
the<00:01:25.520> rigging<00:01:25.790> point<00:01:26.030> down<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.530> wraps<00:01:27.770> at

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the rigging point down to the wraps at

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.950 
the rigging point down to the wraps at
the<00:01:28.159> base<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.549> tree<00:01:28.820> now<00:01:29.450> if<00:01:29.659> we<00:01:29.840> were

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the base of the tree now if we were

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.010 
the base of the tree now if we were
using<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.619> false<00:01:31.189> crotch<00:01:31.520> rigging<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.119> good

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
using a false crotch rigging a good

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.990 
using a false crotch rigging a good
rigging<00:01:33.409> block<00:01:33.619> what<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.220> would<00:01:34.400> do<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.790> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
rigging block what that would do is that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.690 
rigging block what that would do is that
would<00:01:35.299> leave<00:01:36.170> keep<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.770> line<00:01:37.009> pull<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
would leave keep the line pull the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.880 
would leave keep the line pull the
forces<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.390> line<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.659> lot<00:01:39.079> more<00:01:39.140> evenly

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
balanced all throughout the rope so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.270 
balanced all throughout the rope so
that's<00:01:42.110> something<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.500> need<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.740> be<00:01:42.860> aware<00:01:43.220> of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's something you need to be aware of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.120 
that's something you need to be aware of
if<00:01:43.729> you're<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.840> line<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> lot<00:01:46.100> of
