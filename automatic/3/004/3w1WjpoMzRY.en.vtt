00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.550
 the moment we are at 2 on 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.059
 opposite side of the spirit this is 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.710
 we have such about this place here 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.380
 to the saber steppe and where the roll begins 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.110
 satisfied interesting fossa fossa here about 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.080
 7 meters here we want to try 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.100
 catch on the step and try 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.719
 catch you maybe pike perch maybe pike 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.750
 principle on the step and just starting 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.150
 learn the truth is the result I have here 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.080
 here on this place a couple of weeks ago 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.590
 caught a pike 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.020
 kiu somewhere on one and a half nachalova 600 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.120
 somewhere so we will try 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.410
 shoulders 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 the steps that we throw on 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.829
 distance on the pit and lower our fish 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.829
 bait to the bottom then do a couple on 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.200
 cool coil and could wait while she 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.329
 sinks and so on to the very 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.179
 I raise the spinners 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:10.240
 well here that is, we will be on the shore 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.240
 sample 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.620
 we wait while to go down to the snork principle 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.120
 than hard 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.120
 learn on the river so that there is 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 jet 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.909
 after all 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.220
 principles on such a method of catching 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:52.550
 fired mainly perch 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:56.900
 poklevok and jump here 0 gave often 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:02.600
 come across a big pike i do three by 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.890
 four under the gate reel approximately 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.009
 two gateways will go about 70 centimeters I 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.009
 principle did not check it so I heard 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.360
 I'm waiting for a confession to drop to 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 the bottom but since Anisim and experienced and this 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.680
 I look at the tip of the back bulk 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.140
 poklevok 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.460
 arises on so on the step at 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.420
 falling bait 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 that is, when we spin up and she 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.420
 drops somewhere 80 90 percent to 90 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:53.490
 percent poklevok happening on 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.980
 it is the feed phase that is, it means 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.580
 that you shouldn't miss these under 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.210
 you won't catch anything by the shore anymore 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.900
 that there is a fine spring very quickly 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.900
 will fall 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.190
 principle how much I did not watch the transfer and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.080
 video bulk video and stories 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:27.500
 goes the bulk of telling all 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.650
 tells about catching a step on 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.330
 reservoirs 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.470
 either standing water is very hard 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.290
 catch on jet since 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.350
 trolling constantly bears build that is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.670
 on the river you need to look for those places where 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:51.150
 the jet goes into the return or some 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.400
 There are practically no places in the world 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.380
 these places need to look for fish and catch 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.750
 this because if very huge 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.150
 system you have virtually nothing will 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.810
 either you have a very huge load 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.140
 putting on a spoon what does it mean 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.480
 the fish will not fall very quickly 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.480
 managed to react to a big load 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:32.290
 and sudachok 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.670
 what we caught more today for 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.670
 our evening fishing and
