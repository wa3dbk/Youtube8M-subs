00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.460
 before going to the commercial break 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.530
 bailo natalia and claudia franco 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.170
 contemporary several farmhouses was 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.460
 conversing with julie with diego so 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.530
 I saw them the prudent time so that 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.019
 they can converse to agree and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.359
 we are already with the evaluation for claudia 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.359
 frank forward courageous claudia 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.670
 technically I think it's not right 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 is technically sorry that you are missing 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 center that you lack transitions that you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 lack insulation that you lack a series 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.650
 of technical elements that you need 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.300
 have and if you want to dedicate 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.520
 professionally to the dance you have to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 start already to take seriously the issue the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 technical ok but you know he saved you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 the interpretation I feel that you have 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.120
 truly delivered to me you have me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 arrived 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.360
 right now that's why I'm going to put you in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 1616 I god 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 claudia in fact the last thing he said in 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.750
 the topic of interpretation that's what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.580
 that I think has finished me 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.930
 catch and for this reason and municipality I'm going 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.300
 to put 16 july naters 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.470
 you start how great you started 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.120
 varying companies in a way 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.980
 different you started knowing what 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.770
 I felt that something happened to you in the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.340
 way and you let know to control what 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.290
 what did you do 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.760
 however, I agree with my colleagues 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 you have interpreted it very well 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.650
 soul heart and life and that you know what brings 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.410
 good results all flight secret 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.940
 let's go now natalia villanueva teacher 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.610
 bathroom 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.930
 in your case if I see more technique than 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.470
 effectively in fact of more technique 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 but I did not get to the consultation with 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.800
 julie was because she did not understand did not understand 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.290
 What was happening 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.810
 that is, the message did not reach me, it did not arrive 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.640
 to interpretation that no no is not what 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.070
 then then I consulted the choreographer 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.390
 what had happened 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.250
 and he told me it was yours such proposal 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.740
 anyway 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.290
 the topic is technically better but 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 interpretively it does not make me that and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.890
 because it is very important to me 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.510
 interpretive part that were 14 14 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.240
 diego dibÃ³s natalio 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.040
 I hope I'm not trusting you for the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.630
 things so good that we told you yesterday 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.160
 and understand that you have a lot of talent 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.290
 but what you have done today for me has 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.120
 weather state 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.980
 11 deals 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.370
 I love you is a question and I hope 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.049
 that you are very sincere number 1 has been 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.650
 advised in this choreography or I have 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.650
 been one 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.440
 the feeling I have and want 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.120
 help me in choreographers is like 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.130
 I'm also a scriptwriter, it 's like a script 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.320
 not finished and although he started with an idea 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.180
 of that on the other hand can you guys 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.210
 tell us a bit as if the process yes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.540
 Of course, I advise and choreograph 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.730
 natalia apart the dance sequence more 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.140
 the script transforms it already and I 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.780
 I said perfect if you feel comfortable 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.440
 with that, do it, you can clearly see everything 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.950
 it was an advice 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.680
 the good interpreters have yes or yes 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.360
 to trust a third person 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.040
 give yourself to a composer someone who 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.900
 is looking choreographer director that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.720
 out I have the feeling that you reveal 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 a bit because you're good at AlcorcÃ³n 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.980
 value judgment in my perception I feel that 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.480
 you can change the best decision to 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 your best or the other and how are you 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.860
 good you know what happens to be able to zafar 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.570
 of the topic but today he showed me 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.520
 40 percent what you showed yesterday 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.770
 before yesterday and I want to see you like that 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.350
 I think it's great and I want us 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.410
 give the whole Peru what you know how to do 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.110
 and that from tomorrow because today I do not 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.820
 has achieved another secret besides the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.260
 story that he raised was a bit a 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.180
 your story that you had stopped 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 dance because you went on a trip and have 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.230
 brought a little bit of memory and scene 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.320
 how do you feel with the comments of 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.320
