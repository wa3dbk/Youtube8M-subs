00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.270
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.759
 welcome to x 5 x 1 you know your channel 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.320
 of information about the world of apple and 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.900
 today we will be a very fast video but 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.700
 focused on the iPhone 6 because it's from 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.710
 luxe point as a website has 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.750
 published a table with the possible 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 full characteristics of the new 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.039
 iphone 6 will be true or not that not what 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.539
 we know until they present it but 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.340
 certainly to whom they point out that for some 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.020
 we are going to tell them because that is our 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.880
 commitment and what I promise to do 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.350
 always at the end of each video so 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.310
 we go with the intro and I summarize it 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.310
 quickly 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.460
 Well, guys, we're here, thanks 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.200
 be another day in game five 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.000
 one tuning your information channel 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.920
 of support news let's talk about the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 iPhone 6 since the dotcom has 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.100
 posted on your website that you are going to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.010
 can see the article in the description 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 of this video has published a table with 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.730
 the possible characteristics of this 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 new iphone analyzing all the points 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.140
 the topics that I analyzed further from 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.030
 display ie from the screen in 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 hardware the camera the software the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.410
 connectivity and the sensors is even 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.880
 say virtually any detail 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.580
 that you can have a phone are 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.050
 analyzed in this table I already say in the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.490
 description you are going to see the article of 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.619
 our website where we have attached that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.650
 table we also edit a citation to the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.690
 original source in case you want to visit it 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.940
 and such what we should highlight like this 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.380
 in summary form is for example then 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.480
 that we find an iphone with 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.120
 an improved battery lighter and with 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.160
 more screen then we can also see 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.640
 an improvement in the camera in the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.860
 megapixels 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 the iphone 5 is we did not see an improvement 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.250
 Regarding the iPhone 5 in the megapixels 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.810
 from the camera we saw improvements in the in 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.640
 about software the technology of the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.200
 camera but not as for the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 megapixels because apparently this new 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.430
 iphone 6 and so I would incorporate a 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.990
 improvement of megapixels increasing the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.869
 megapixels of the main camera is 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.119
 say the back at 12 and the camera 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.590
 forward at 8 is to say that the best 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.119
 important because we already know that 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.470
 any other manufacturer maybe 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.909
 can simply sell an improvement in 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.320
 the megapixels but when we talk about 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.729
 we already know that the megapixels 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.100
 They are also accompanied by a large 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.440
 software and great quality in everything 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.479
 that requires your lenses so great 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.920
 improve but it's not the only one as well 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.600
 in a summarized way we can see that in 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.300
 As for specifications we see a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.010
 increase in ram memory that would arrive 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.959
 up to 2 gigas and also the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 processor in theory the new chip to 8 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.430
 of support been a dual processor 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.320
 core to 2 gigahertz nothing badly true 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.690
 then as for screen is the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.250
 resolution is not very accurate good if 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.840
 there is some concrete data but I do not know if 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.400
 they really will be what they are because that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.200
 and yes it is true that according to the site 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.610
 where you see it, they vary a lot but 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 perhaps another important thing is that this one 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 does not go and why would not add nfc 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.180
 what is something that contradicts others 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.040
 blogs like analyst reports that yes 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.720
 who say that the nfc would come already 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 Built in this new iphone yo 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.620
 really officiate zero giving my 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 opinion I do not know to what extent we will see 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.150
 on iPhone 6 because on May 7 the one 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 way of the 2013 same buy 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.120
 sacriste del jean denying that it is 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.280
 supporter of nfc technology 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.780
 mocking when he introduced the new 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.690
 added feature that I always 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.160
 so we 'll see but this is what there is 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.050
 guys and this is what we can 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.430
 count as to specifications of 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.810
 new iphone you already know that in the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.490
 description are you going to have an article of 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.930
 our website where alberto contreras 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.190
 spoke about this news we have put you 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.080
 the complete table for you to complete 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.850

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.750
 this team is also here so guys
