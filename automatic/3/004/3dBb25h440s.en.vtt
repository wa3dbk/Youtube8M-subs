since<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.639> my<00:00:08.849> other<00:00:08.970> truth<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:09.809> recipes

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
since you like my other truth or recipes

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.100 
since you like my other truth or recipes
I<00:00:10.590> decided<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.460> another<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:11.929> this<00:00:12.929> one's

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
I decided to do another one this one's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.079 
I decided to do another one this one's
for<00:00:13.259> rice<00:00:13.500> pudding<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.759> good<00:00:14.910> for

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
for rice pudding it's really good for

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.970 
for rice pudding it's really good for
truthers<00:00:15.450> because<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.800> basically

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
truthers because you just basically

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.330 
truthers because you just basically
bring<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> ingredients<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> boil<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
bring the ingredients to a boil and then

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.529 
bring the ingredients to a boil and then
reduce<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.520> let<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.760> simmer<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.390> an

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
reduce it let it simmer for about an

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.060 
reduce it let it simmer for about an
hour<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:22.170> means<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.529> should<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.710> back<00:00:22.890> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
hour which means you should be back on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.759 
hour which means you should be back on
the<00:00:23.189> internet<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.609> no<00:00:23.699> time<00:00:24.590> you're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to

the internet in no time you're going to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.689 
the internet in no time you're going to
need<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.849> coconut<00:00:27.269> milk<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:29.070> empty<00:00:29.460> into

need a can of coconut milk to empty into

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.780 
need a can of coconut milk to empty into
your<00:00:29.849> pot<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> coconut<00:00:32.759> milk<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:34.790> guar

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
metabisulfite but other than that I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.440 
metabisulfite but other than that I
think<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.469> okay<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.100> guess<00:00:44.940> next<00:00:45.180> time<00:00:45.270> we'll

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
think it's okay I guess next time we'll

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.729 
think it's okay I guess next time we'll
make<00:00:45.570> sure<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> find<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.620> doesn't

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
make sure that I find one that doesn't

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.639 
make sure that I find one that doesn't
have<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> stuff<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.960> add<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> cup

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
have that stuff in it and you add a cup

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.540 
have that stuff in it and you add a cup
of<00:00:49.850> cow's<00:00:50.850> milk<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.449> soy<00:00:51.750> milk<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.370> have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
of cow's milk or soy milk we don't have

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
of cow's milk or soy milk we don't have
hormones<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> Canadian<00:00:54.899> milk<00:00:55.110> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hormones in the Canadian milk here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
hormones in the Canadian milk here
because<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> dr.<00:00:55.860> Schiff<00:00:56.219> Chopra<00:00:56.640> who<00:00:56.820> made

for importing american milk that has
hormones<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.310> if

hormones in it so I really don't know if
my<00:01:08.549> aunt<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:09.030> hormones<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.720> not

hormones will kill you then you add half

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
hormones will kill you then you add half

cup of brown rice okay now for the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.320 
cup of brown rice okay now for the
spices<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> spices<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> fun<00:01:20.790> part<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
spices the spices are the fun part a

spices the spices are the fun part a
teaspoon<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.409> cinnamon<00:01:23.990> cinnamon<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.200> amazing

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
teaspoon of cinnamon cinnamon is amazing

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.940 
teaspoon of cinnamon cinnamon is amazing
it<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.009> high<00:01:26.369> orac<00:01:26.880> value<00:01:27.110> oxygen<00:01:28.110> radical

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it has a high orac value oxygen radical

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.569 
it has a high orac value oxygen radical
absorbance<00:01:29.820> e-cat<00:01:30.329> capacity<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
absorbance e-cat capacity it's like to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
absorbance e-cat capacity it's like to
absorb<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.390> free<00:01:33.869> radicals<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.530> body<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
absorb the free radicals in your body so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
absorb the free radicals in your body so
it's<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.280> antioxidant<00:01:36.090> basically<00:01:36.509> you're

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it's an antioxidant basically you're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's an antioxidant basically you're
supposed<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> aim<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.320> 6,000<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.340> acts<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> day

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
supposed to aim for 6,000 or acts a day

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
supposed to aim for 6,000 or acts a day
and<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.110> third<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> teaspoon<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and just a third of a teaspoon of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.679 
and just a third of a teaspoon of
cinnamon<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:43.460> 2,000<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.610> acts<00:01:44.820> oh<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
cinnamon has 2,000 or acts oh and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.999 
cinnamon has 2,000 or acts oh and
another<00:01:45.869> benefit<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> cinnamon<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
another benefit of cinnamon is it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.090 
another benefit of cinnamon is it
decreases<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.729> insulin<00:01:48.270> resistance<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
decreases your insulin resistance if you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
decreases your insulin resistance if you
getting<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.759> lot<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> high<00:01:51.240> high<00:01:51.720> blood<00:01:51.990> sugar

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
getting a lot of high high blood sugar

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
getting a lot of high high blood sugar
all<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.649> your<00:01:52.920> cells<00:01:53.310> become<00:01:53.759> less

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
all the time your cells become less

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
all the time your cells become less
sensitive<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.259> insulin<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.920> become<00:01:56.130> insulin

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
sensitive to insulin they become insulin

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
sensitive to insulin they become insulin
resistant<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> precursor<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
resistant and that's like a precursor to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
resistant and that's like a precursor to
diabetes<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.420> cinnamon<00:02:02.270> makes<00:02:03.270> them

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
diabetes and the cinnamon makes them

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.219 
diabetes and the cinnamon makes them
more<00:02:03.719> sensitive<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> less<00:02:05.790> less<00:02:06.450> insulin

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
more sensitive so a less less insulin

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
more sensitive so a less less insulin
resistance<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> good<00:02:08.700> thing

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
resistance so that's a good thing

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.919 
resistance so that's a good thing
assuming<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.390> don't<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> become

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
assuming you don't want to become
