00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 a truck that circulated from ramírez 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.779
 south towards the thompson area 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 he ran out of brakes and crashed from behind 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.580
 to a suzuki fun that was parked 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 in the line to cross the traffic light that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 he was in that moment with light 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 red but in his violent career the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.010
 truck also rammed a renault 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 clio which by the force of the shock 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.039
 He stumbled several times until he was posted 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 passing the junction of both arteries by 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 the mechanical damage the heavy rolled 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 it hit a motorcyclist who also 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
 I was waiting for the semaphore cut and for 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 last collided with a truck that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.690
 circulated in laurencena in the direction 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.059
 towards ramírez as reported from the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.350
 police the multiple shock left a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.500
 total of four people injured 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.839
 and go down with the truck and if 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.409
 we say that without brakes try to brake 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.300
 for the engine and lowering the change 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.659
 of the blocker and I did not start playing 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.940
 horn and nobody ran I tried to poke 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.210
 the truck to avoid hitting anyone me 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.340
 I hooked the black car from behind and I hope 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.330
 against the white shirt he was in front 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.460
 Currently a technical strawberry 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.280
 regardless 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.369
 the glass of water also brings us to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.700
 think so but it did not come much 20 of 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.560
 that 30 with that and with speed brake 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.090
 you are as is at this moment the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.759
 good people somehow have their 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 release touched to know and I bad 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.270
 because due person were 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.340
 flexed and came from one I understand that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.300
 I was angry and came here to pay more and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.300
 what but not 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 he looks nervous and also from some 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.690
 telling people that it was a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.210
 technical failure 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:52.560
 it was not exactly my fault it was the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 truck that does not need it but I do not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.610
 I feel bad for the people who went into 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.979
 state of shock from immediately 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.990
 saw how were the people who are going to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.990
 there to see how they were 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.910
 it's not my fault and I had no way of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.600
 brake that transports this vehicle what 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.600
 type of vehicle 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.150
 to the mechanical workshop 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.150
 that things 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 it will not be the problem for which I had 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.900
 carried no no no for the subject of light
