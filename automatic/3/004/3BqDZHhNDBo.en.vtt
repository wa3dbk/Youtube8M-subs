but still you know through through the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
but still you know through through the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
things it's it's this one that I just

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.310 
things it's it's this one that I just
have<00:03:20.739> memories<00:03:21.100> from<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:22.390> many<00:03:22.540> many<00:03:22.810> years

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
have memories from for many many years

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.140 
have memories from for many many years
even<00:03:23.920> when<00:03:24.010> Garry<00:03:24.220> Moore<00:03:24.519> did<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:24.820> you've<00:03:25.030> ever

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
even when Garry Moore did if you've ever

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.590 
even when Garry Moore did if you've ever
heard<00:03:25.329> his<00:03:25.480> version<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.989> was<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.410> great<00:03:26.590> version

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
heard his version it was a great version

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.370 
heard his version it was a great version
so<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.890> difficult<00:03:30.400> thing<00:03:30.609> for<00:03:30.640> me<00:03:30.989> was<00:03:31.989> that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
so the difficult thing for me was that

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.830 
so the difficult thing for me was that
although<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.489> was<00:03:33.549> there<00:03:34.180> was<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.359> great<00:03:34.600> honor

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
although it was there was a great honor

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.880 
although it was there was a great honor
to<00:03:35.470> play<00:03:35.739> with<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> band<00:03:37.350> their<00:03:38.350> guitarist

mean<00:03:53.139> when<00:03:53.500> Beck<00:03:53.739> was<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.130> band

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
mean when Beck was in the band

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.569 
mean when Beck was in the band
it<00:03:55.060> was<00:03:55.329> very<00:03:55.900> Beca<00:03:56.260> SH<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:57.069> was<00:03:57.250> great

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
it was very Beca SH and that was great

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.729 
it was very Beca SH and that was great
and<00:03:57.790> when<00:03:58.150> page<00:03:58.630> or<00:03:58.959> Clapton<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
and when page or Clapton you know and

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.680 
and when page or Clapton you know and
they<00:03:59.829> did<00:04:00.010> all<00:04:00.100> that<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.430> mean<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.540> was

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
they did all that I mean it was

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.289 
they did all that I mean it was
tremendous<00:04:02.200> when<00:04:02.380> they<00:04:02.530> were<00:04:02.650> contributing

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
tremendous when they were contributing

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.789 
tremendous when they were contributing
but<00:04:04.299> Jimmy<00:04:04.630> just<00:04:04.810> seems<00:04:05.019> like<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.560> know<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
but Jimmy just seems like you know the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.370 
but Jimmy just seems like you know the
perfect<00:04:06.040> guitarist<00:04:06.700> for<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.030> band<00:04:07.389> and<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
perfect guitarist for that band and the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.500 
perfect guitarist for that band and the
solo<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.799> he<00:04:08.920> did<00:04:09.100> on<00:04:09.250> shapes<00:04:09.609> was<00:04:10.150> really

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
solo that he did on shapes was really

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.410 
solo that he did on shapes was really
wonderful<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.769> felt<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.100> little<00:04:12.220> guilty

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
bombastic indulgent guitar thing that I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.469
