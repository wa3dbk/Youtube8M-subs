00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi to all friends hoover and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 on this new video on my subway 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 automatic then saw the success of the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 first video that I did so on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.389
 this map 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.969
 well I wanted to remake a little 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.840
 video to answer some 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.160
 comments left by viewers there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.350
 there were particular drinkers who would me 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 asked to see a little bit of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.760
 circuit starts was behind that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 I had spent and also to explain myself 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.519
 how does the small system work 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.820
 sound that goes off every time 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 a mind map arrives at the station 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.640
 So that's what we're going to do here 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.020
 know that I'm working on 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.420
 the improvement of this system 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 so there may be not all of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590
 following but later a new video 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 which presents the improved system 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.239
 then I also work on the bugs of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 chunk that some may have does 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 that the red stone freezes at a distance 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.770
 too far away from the player and so the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.739
 system does not work properly 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.719
 so here are two future future video 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 improved 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.670
 really you have judged yourself I believe 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 about 4000 views on this video 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.710
 so this is my most viewed video then 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.720
 so I'm going to remind you so how 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 it works so we will make your and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 systems 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.690
 we will put the sound so that you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.210
 hear well 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.140
 the obs and small melodies each time 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.300
 that the same card arrives 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.590
 hop we're going to start the system we're going 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.520
 put ten seconds of delay between 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.320
 every month a map 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.600
 so I'm going on the dock so here 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 Here I am, I wait for my metro 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.850
 tranquillou and up there a subway arrives 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.520
 here is the subway stops this game goes up or 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.870
 not and he goes away so here is the little 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.600
 ringtone that warned me of the arrival 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.960
 of a man cards and that so at each and same 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.000
 map 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 so we will stop system is 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.750
 it works 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:02.260
 and presto so here's that here you see 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.820
 a rail detectors and when the same car 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.530
 you'll go on this rally and hector 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.900
 that's where the sound system gets 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.220
 then actually triggers so really 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.810
 it's a subway you know that a subway 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.730
 is buried, but if I have made 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 on the earth so you can 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.770
 show you well how these 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.620
 damn and me too that makes me less of 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.209
 work I do not use fashion so 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.160
 make a dressing like that as much as 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.100
 underground it costs less 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.560
 so that's what it looks like outside 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.120
 see the stations the corridors 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.800
 it's not very big I did that three 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.030
 stations I 'll make it healthier in the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.410
 next videos for this be more 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 realistic but it's really a lot 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.050
 a lot of work 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.959
 So here we are under our our rail 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.790
 detector so who has a son of red 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.200
 stone and son gilded stone goes up 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 systems that I realized here on a 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.650
 little platform in the air here we 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 are we are at the level of the duke is 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.700
 in fact we are right behind it 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 the sound system must be fair 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.330
 behind the dock so that we 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.650
 hear from the platform the sound signal if 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.050
 you're doing too far it's useless 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.340
 below that is the shutdown system 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 reboot for that same cards 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.370
 stop and restart here so that's 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.450
 for that I made a platform 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.580
 to do it just above because 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.220
 we're running out of space the circuit is the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.300
 even at each each station so you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.489
 do you pull a redstone cable 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.100
 if there is a repeater because the 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.440
 distance is too long otherwise if 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.950
 so you ask me for example I 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.230
 chose three notes block 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.430
 wanted to separate you do not put side 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.230
 to side otherwise it would trigger in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.720
 same time if you are in an old 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.940
 snowy men like me unless they 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.410
 be shelter finally here it is necessary me 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.459
 I put a block on top for 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.650
 shelter because if there is a surin block 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.860
 block music or if there is snow well 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.239
 it will prevent the system from working 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.340
 so here there are blogs to prevent that 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.599
 the snow falls on it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 so after that it's simple you connect the 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.530
 connect so to the first here to the first 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.970
 our block between the first and the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.440
 second you make a delay with 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.360
 publishers you put a fourth 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.380
 notch at the second notch and between the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.390
 second and third 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.069
 like 1 at the second big time 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.420
 fourth time so that's it's a 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.250
 delay between notes for it to be 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.459
 played whether it's not playing at the same 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.019
 time 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.739
 if there is a little button to test the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.280
 system and that's it then after he 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.829
 must choose 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.880
 obviously the notes you want 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.920
 to play admits our block 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.560
 here I chose to play a back 1 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.700
 me and insolent for that you have to click 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.430
 so many times on blogs 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 until getting the desired rating on 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.550
 minecraft him who knows very well damn 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.950
 there are paintings with different 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.660
 notes that can be played according to the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.520
 number of clicks so I invite you to 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.490
 go on minecraft which I will put the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.289
 page link in the description of 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.000
 the video 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.310
 something else too we know you you 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.360
 may know ours block I you 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.539
 different sounds 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.970
 according to the blog on which he is posed by 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.680
 example so the different types 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.690
 of instruments that we can 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.100
 to play 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.740
 so here are the cdc a few these 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.090
 examples of blocks but here I am going to 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.370
 show all examples of instruments 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.669
 different that we can play 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.990
 according to the block so the piano for example 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.830
 it's with the block to do or earth 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.180
 you see it's another sound 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:16.130
 on a block of wood on the sand of 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:19.580
 percussion a little bit on the stone is 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.030
 sure the green so it's up to you to 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.550
 choose your sound also the case 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.360
 uncomplicated system and my strong faith 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.970
 nice 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.479
 provided of course to have the sound 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.220
 before you leave 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.930
 we'll do a little tour in more detail 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.970
 from the outside 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.570
 wanted to see how it really is 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.930
 that would be supposed to be buried here that's 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.360
 we see that there is a wicket here behind 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.490
 and here I am again I do not know 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.990
 if I say them elsewhere that's if you 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.820
 also you have not seen my video my 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.919
 first video presentation of this 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.720
 system was really going to have it since 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.039
 I present everything in detail you see 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.630
 system in operation and that's it on 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.169
 this bath I'll see you soon for 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.740
 new subway videos and by then 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.740
 wear well
