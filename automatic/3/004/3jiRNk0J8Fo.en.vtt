the<00:03:27.419> reason<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.780> say<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.169> because<00:03:28.530> most<00:03:28.769> of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the reason I say that is because most of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.899 
the reason I say that is because most of
the<00:03:29.040> things<00:03:29.190> you're<00:03:29.280> gonna<00:03:29.400> find<00:03:29.669> in<00:03:29.849> a

the things you're gonna find in a

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.569 
the things you're gonna find in a
wrapper<00:03:30.239> are<00:03:30.419> highly<00:03:30.959> processed<00:03:31.340> well<00:03:32.340> let<00:03:32.549> me

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
wrapper are highly processed well let me

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.069 
wrapper are highly processed well let me
ask<00:03:32.730> dr.<00:03:32.879> corday<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.329> question<00:03:33.659> we'll<00:03:33.989> have

generally<00:03:42.479> surrounded<00:03:43.139> even<00:03:43.379> in<00:03:43.470> my<00:03:43.590> own<00:03:43.799> case

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
generally surrounded even in my own case

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.640 
generally surrounded even in my own case
by<00:03:44.269> misconceptions<00:03:45.269> then<00:03:45.599> people<00:03:45.870> trying<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
by misconceptions then people trying to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.780 
by misconceptions then people trying to
explain<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.069> me<00:03:47.159> but<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.370> quite<00:03:47.579> getting

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
explain it to me but not quite getting

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.670 
explain it to me but not quite getting
it<00:03:47.940> right<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.540> what's<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:49.109> your<00:03:49.290> opinion<00:03:49.590> is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
it right so what's in your opinion is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.140 
it right so what's in your opinion is
your<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.190> probably<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.549> world<00:03:50.729> expert<00:03:51.120> in

your the probably the world expert in
his<00:03:51.329> diet<00:03:51.540> what<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.959> biggest

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
his diet what is the biggest

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.379 
his diet what is the biggest
misconception<00:03:52.500> about<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.250> Paleo<00:03:53.459> diet<00:03:53.819> well

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
misconception about the Paleo diet well

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.330 
misconception about the Paleo diet well
thank<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.109> for<00:03:55.229> that<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.590> nice<00:03:55.739> compliment

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
thank you for that the nice compliment

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.729 
thank you for that the nice compliment
but<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.940> think<00:03:57.479> probably<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.900> biggest<00:03:58.079> thing

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
but I think probably the biggest thing

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.349 
but I think probably the biggest thing
that<00:03:58.799> people<00:03:58.979> think<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.639> that<00:03:59.909> it's<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.150> fad

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
that people think is that it's a fad

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.379 
that people think is that it's a fad
diet<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:01.169> if<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.979> is<00:04:02.129> a<00:04:02.159> fad<00:04:02.430> diet<00:04:02.729> it's<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
diet and if it is a fad diet it's the

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.080 
diet and if it is a fad diet it's the
the<00:04:04.049> longest<00:04:04.409> living<00:04:04.680> fad<00:04:05.010> we've<00:04:05.340> ever<00:04:05.489> had<00:04:05.819> it

the longest living fad we've ever had it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.059 
the longest living fad we've ever had it
goes<00:04:06.299> for<00:04:06.569> two<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.109> half<00:04:07.229> million<00:04:07.500> years<00:04:07.680> up

to appreciate in order to truly practice
the<00:05:08.940> Paleo<00:05:09.240> diet<00:05:09.480> so<00:05:09.960> rule<00:05:10.140> number<00:05:10.170> one<00:05:10.500> and
