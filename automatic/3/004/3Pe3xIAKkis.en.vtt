00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
and last them into their shoals and then

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.549 
and last them into their shoals and then
wire<00:00:46.370> them<00:00:46.699> up<00:00:49.659> half<00:00:50.659> a<00:00:50.839> ton<00:00:51.049> of<00:00:51.080> batteries

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
wire them up half a ton of batteries

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:01.060 
wire them up half a ton of batteries
people<00:00:56.019> yeah<00:00:57.019> they're<00:00:57.320> 200<00:00:57.799> amp<00:00:57.920> hour<00:00:58.159> or<00:01:00.070> 226

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
people yeah they're 200 amp hour or 226

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.310 
people yeah they're 200 amp hour or 226
amp<00:01:01.309> hour<00:01:01.610> at<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.239> 20<00:01:02.510> hour<00:01:02.659> rate<00:01:02.960> which<00:01:03.170> is

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
amp hour at the 20 hour rate which is

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.520 
amp hour at the 20 hour rate which is
what<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.589> use<00:01:03.680> for<00:01:03.710> solar<00:01:04.220> for<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:05.440> 226<00:01:06.440> I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
what you use for solar for the 226 I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.340 
what you use for solar for the 226 I
think<00:01:06.710> it's<00:01:06.830> 226<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:07.909> they're<00:01:08.060> 226<00:01:08.930> amp<00:01:09.110> hour

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
think it's 226 so they're 226 amp hour

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.649 
think it's 226 so they're 226 amp hour
at<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.520> 20<00:01:10.820> hour<00:01:10.970> right<00:01:11.770> all<00:01:12.770> right<00:01:13.539> I'll<00:01:14.539> get

at the 20 hour right all right I'll get

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.639 
at the 20 hour right all right I'll get
back<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.140> nah<00:01:15.380> we<00:01:15.859> got<00:01:16.009> four<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:17.140> -<00:01:18.140> four
