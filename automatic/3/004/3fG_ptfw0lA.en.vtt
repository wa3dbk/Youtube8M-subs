00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 the 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.389
 we are in this line only 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.460
 a few miles from the place where 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.440
 the accident that took the 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.279
 life of the whole Lima alliance 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.550
 at the end of the 80s the relatives always 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.060
 they asked and it happened that the band 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.640
 began to come to light in 2006 when 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.970
 a reporter was able to access the report 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.849
 Officer of the Navy of Peru, where 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.670
 there were unpublished details of that 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.670
 night of December 1987 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.760
 in the navy reveal your own report is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.489
 the responsibility of this institution 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.140
 around the death of those of the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.290
 areas and this is one of the things that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.320
 determines with total clarity of the report 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.050
 was that this pilot in situations of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.960
 I did not respond to stress situations Nosa 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.680
 where the ship could suffer some kind 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.869
 The pilot simply went 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.790
 canceled and that's what happened and then 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.310
 the reason why the plane fell 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 according to hildebrandt's research 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.620
 chaves when the fokker f-27 is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.650
 I was preparing to go through the 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.410
 Lima airport by averaging 8 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.230
 the night the pilot of the ship and 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 edilberto villar action or the train of 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.000
 landing but the control panel does not 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.360
 it marked the descent of the tires 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.430
 front of the plane before the doubt the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 Lieutenant Villar advised the tower of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 control that would give a new spin 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.110
 you have sense 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.380
 of sectors answered that if there was 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.710
 decided but the platoon by not seeing in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.860
 its controls that this had happened 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.120
 decided to go one more lap without calculating 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.120
 the descent of the ship 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.360
 the pilot because he did not know what the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 correct indicator removed from the panel 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.910
 of control then took a bad 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.250
 decision that was to try to make 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.530
 movement of this icon in the nose of the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.800
 plane so that the landing gear in 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.170
 the ihss go down with gravity not 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.170
 no ship is ever made 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.580
 did not have the 10-3 indication that the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.260
 train was in fact correct when the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.170
 pilot passed near the tower of 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.020
 control they tell you hey your train has come down to 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.840
 through 3 that is down the pilot of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.640
 a little bit that had burned him 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.310
 he said no but there was another one that 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.950
 he said yes the indication of the one that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.739
 had to go down had to do it in that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.360
 moment and all this added to that the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.610
 pilot does not respond in situations of 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.610
 stress and they are simply stars 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.739
 during the investigation the lieutenant the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.319
 I try to shine told details of the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.620
 terrible moments that lived behind 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.409
 that of the fokker a part of the report 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 of the navy mentions having been found 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:21.349
 with the cold tomasini in the sea 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.349
 dawned together on a water drum 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.050
 this instrument does not what the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.660
 pilot is that tomasín that had fallen 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.120
 but his leg was broken and in 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.480
 Sometime just tomasini 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.810
 comes off of this and saying and second 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.150
 the rest 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.160
 the troops of the navy people throw 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.800
 the pilot could demonstrate that the 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.260
 pilot had lied many times in his 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.920
 version for example against rescuing the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.020
 pilot of the pilot did not have the shoes 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.180
 they did not have the military shoes 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.790
 when they ask him why he did not have 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.000
 shoes he says is something point with tomás 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.550
 and I'm turned on this one only brings a can of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.610
 empty water he takes them off to be able 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.680
 Float more when they rescue the plane 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.139
 they find the pilot's shoes on the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.840
 cabin then it is impossible for 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.120
 shoes have returned to the cabin 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 then that will understand that I have 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.840
 many times and he gave me the word of 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.840
 the subversion 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.830
 a manifestation of the pilot 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:41.600
 for my house because just like that or it is 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
 that class 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.520
 if they were different 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.800
 because in a very nervous way it 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:57.410
 worried a lot when it did not come or go 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:00.100
 delay more then in my house because I do not 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.100
 he dies 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.960
 the fact that if there is that 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.960
 night 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.770
 the version of the pilot is that tomasín and 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.080
 his leg was broken and he 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.479
 he just fell apart 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.020
 this can say with dying like that 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.020
 let die 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.150
 this document keeps the only 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.880
 statements provided by the pilot 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.390
 I want to shine on the tragedy of 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.360
 window and also the last thing that 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.270
 knew about alfredo tomasini until the day 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.700
 today 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.070
 the lieutenant shine practically came out 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.620
 to look and there 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.790
 and it is presumed that he made his life in 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.790
 australia I think if they put us in 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.910
 action of him 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.260
 says that I have done everything possible 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.910
 save your son 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.810
 and I have face to face I have the 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.430
 enough between the 17 I did everything 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:15.000
 possible I could not 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.000
 ok we do not face simple 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.630
 because you can not tell him face to face 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.280
 it's here that prevents you 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.280
 as not necessarily the whole kitchen 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.780
 I 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.880
 none of the players who perished 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.009
 in poker he got an information 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.979
 satisfactory about what 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:56.780
 it truly happened that night of 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:59.560
 December 8, 1987 many of these 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.509
 families people of humble status 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.060
 they ceased their claims 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:07.060
 - 1 family detonations
