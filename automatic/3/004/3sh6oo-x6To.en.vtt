notice<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.910> am<00:00:24.150> wearing<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.750> pseudo<00:00:25.470> Indiana

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
notice I am wearing a pseudo Indiana

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259 
notice I am wearing a pseudo Indiana
Jones<00:00:26.099> costume<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> Hat<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
Jones costume I know the Hat is the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970 
Jones costume I know the Hat is the
wrong<00:00:27.539> color<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.289> figured<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:28.949> be

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
wrong color but I figured it would be

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
wrong color but I figured it would be
good<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.359> get<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> part<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.019> Indiana

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
music I also did a couple of stunts to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.650

get<00:00:36.600> into<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> role<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:42.450> they

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
get into the role as well but they

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.869
