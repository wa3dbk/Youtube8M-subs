00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 all or 8 i.e. all will be deleted 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.480
 files and folders to this need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.879
 prepare and service to transfer all 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 documents are important and necessary for you 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 to external usb carrier 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.189
 hard drive up to a year and since i was talking 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 earlier 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 you must boot under the poppy axis for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 reboot your thread 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.890
 and while loading, press and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 hold alt 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.409
 Now I click I live alt key 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.280
 there was a choice between loading 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.710
 operating systems for mac os 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.580
 or windows interested mac os choose 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.580
 would unload and media 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:16.569
 so after we went first 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:20.890
 I want to watch show 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:27.500
 section with windows this go faynder

 equal parts i.e. 250 gigabytes each 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:03.709
 It is worth noting that you can delete a partition 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.060
 from here click on the minus sign and delete 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.060

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.879
