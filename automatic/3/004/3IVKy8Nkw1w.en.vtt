00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that mean and basically what I mean by

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
that mean and basically what I mean by
that<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.850> something

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that is I want to see something

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
that is I want to see something
incredible<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.200> Dragon<00:01:43.560> Ball<00:01:43.590> Z<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.189> example

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
incredible in Dragon Ball Z for example

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.030 
incredible in Dragon Ball Z for example
let's<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.450> say<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> villain<00:01:46.229> comes<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.799> earth

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
let's just say a villain comes to earth

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
let's just say a villain comes to earth
and<00:01:47.250> blows<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> Sun<00:01:48.240> therefore<00:01:48.960> Goku

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and blows up the Sun therefore Goku

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
and blows up the Sun therefore Goku
can't<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.579> protect<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> earth<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
can't really protect the earth because

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.950 
can't really protect the earth because
the<00:01:51.930> earth<00:01:52.140> can't<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.700> survive<00:01:54.659> without

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the earth can't really survive without

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.100 
the earth can't really survive without
the<00:01:55.350> Sun<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.189> let's<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.939> say<00:01:57.119> Goku<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the Sun so let's just say Goku has to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
the Sun so let's just say Goku has to
find<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> save<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> entire

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
find out a way to save the entire

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
find out a way to save the entire
Earth's<00:02:00.299> population<00:02:00.680> but<00:02:01.680> how<00:02:01.920> does<00:02:01.979> he<00:02:02.159> do

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
Earth's population but how does he do

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
Earth's population but how does he do
that<00:02:02.369> well<00:02:03.119> I'm<00:02:03.299> glad<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.780> asked<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.290> no

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that well I'm glad you asked and no

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.139 
that well I'm glad you asked and no
don't<00:02:04.979> worry<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> say<00:02:05.880> wish

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
don't worry I'm not going to say wish

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.880 
don't worry I'm not going to say wish
for<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> Sun<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> come<00:02:06.840> back<00:02:07.049> instead<00:02:07.649> I'm

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
for the Sun to come back instead I'm

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889 
for the Sun to come back instead I'm
actually<00:02:08.220> thinking<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.789> Goku<00:02:09.179> using<00:02:09.509> instant

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
actually thinking of Goku using instant

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.080 
actually thinking of Goku using instant
transmission<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> teleport<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.489> earth<00:02:11.700> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
transmission to teleport the earth to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.040 
transmission to teleport the earth to
some<00:02:12.300> other<00:02:12.510> place

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
some other place

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.290 
some other place
universe<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> mean<00:02:14.790> by<00:02:14.850> amazing

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300

fits I want to see something just

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.700 
fits I want to see something just
astronomical<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.690> terms<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.110> speed<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.590> terms

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
astronomical in terms of speed in terms

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.410 
astronomical in terms of speed in terms
of<00:02:19.920> strength<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.730> don't<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.240> how

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420

transporting the earth via instant

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.190 
transporting the earth via instant
transmission<00:02:23.850> would<00:02:24.000> actually<00:02:24.360> work<00:02:24.630> but

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
transmission would actually work but

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.780 
transmission would actually work but
hopefully<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.710> guys<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.310> mean

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
overall I can sum this up is I want

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.650 
overall I can sum this up is I want
these<00:02:29.160> characters<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.850> grow<00:02:30.000> stronger<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
these characters to grow stronger I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
now many people dislike hube and I can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.970 
now many people dislike hube and I can
totally<00:02:41.880> see<00:02:42.090> why<00:02:42.120> he<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.590> showed<00:02:43.830> up

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
totally see why he really just showed up

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680 
totally see why he really just showed up
at<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> end<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.400> Dragon<00:02:44.820> Ball<00:02:44.910> Z<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.450> take

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
at the end of Dragon Ball Z just to take

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.570 
at the end of Dragon Ball Z just to take
the<00:02:45.840> spotlight<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.890> didn't<00:02:47.190> sit<00:02:47.400> well

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
the spotlight and that didn't sit well

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
the spotlight and that didn't sit well
with<00:02:47.640> people<00:02:48.000> however<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.200> Erb<00:02:49.770> has

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
with people however I do think Erb has

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.920 
with people however I do think Erb has
so<00:02:50.430> much<00:02:50.610> potential<00:02:51.030> within<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.540> Dragon

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
so much potential within the Dragon

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.050 
so much potential within the Dragon
Balls<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.200> universe<00:02:52.650> considering<00:02:53.280> he<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
Balls the universe considering he is the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.180 
Balls the universe considering he is the
reincarnate<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.900> Kid<00:02:55.140> Buu<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:56.040> love

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
reincarnate of Kid Buu and I would love

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.340 
reincarnate of Kid Buu and I would love
to<00:02:56.340> see<00:02:56.490> Erb<00:02:56.760> actually<00:02:57.510> go<00:02:57.630> ahead<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.900> fuse

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
to see Erb actually go ahead and fuse

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.950 
to see Erb actually go ahead and fuse
with<00:02:58.380> majin<00:02:59.010> buu<00:02:59.130> again<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.150> actually<00:03:00.600> have

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
with majin buu again but actually have

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.410 
with majin buu again but actually have
it<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.380> Erb<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:02.010> utilized<00:03:02.520> within<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.060> series

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it so Erb is utilized within the series

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.810 
it so Erb is utilized within the series
and<00:03:03.630> actually<00:03:04.260> make<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.650> when<00:03:04.980> ov<00:03:05.220> fuses

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and actually make it so when ov fuses

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.030 
and actually make it so when ov fuses
with<00:03:06.000> majin<00:03:06.360> buu<00:03:06.540> he<00:03:06.960> actually<00:03:07.410> obtains<00:03:07.800> all

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
with majin buu he actually obtains all

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.850 
with majin buu he actually obtains all
of<00:03:08.220> his<00:03:08.370> abilities<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:09.060> regeneration

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
of his abilities like regeneration

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.750 
of his abilities like regeneration
regardless<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:10.980> am<00:03:11.100> looking<00:03:11.430> forward<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
fusing them together is one of the best

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.320 
fusing them together is one of the best
ideas<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.200> think<00:03:28.470> Dragon<00:03:29.100> Ball<00:03:29.250> Z<00:03:29.459> has<00:03:29.670> ever<00:03:29.970> had

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
ideas I think Dragon Ball Z has ever had

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.990 
ideas I think Dragon Ball Z has ever had
but<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.989> not<00:03:31.170> only<00:03:31.410> talking<00:03:31.800> about<00:03:32.040> Gogeta<00:03:32.730> or

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
but I'm not only talking about Gogeta or

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.510 
but I'm not only talking about Gogeta or

Vegeta or even go tanks I'm talking
about<00:03:35.580> fusing<00:03:36.239> some<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.570> villains

together

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
together

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.070

imagine<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.370> Bureau<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.850> fused<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.270> Wiese<00:03:39.600> or

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
imagine if Bureau is fused with Wiese or

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.810 
imagine if Bureau is fused with Wiese or
if<00:03:40.290> there<00:03:40.470> was<00:03:40.620> an<00:03:40.739> evil<00:03:41.040> god<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.520> one<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
if there was an evil god in one of the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.699 
if there was an evil god in one of the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
evil God in another separate universe
honestly<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.620> think<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.010> pretty<00:03:47.220> obvious<00:03:47.280> my

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
honestly I think it's pretty obvious my

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.940 
honestly I think it's pretty obvious my
feelings<00:03:48.300> on<00:03:48.510> fusions<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.200> obviously<00:03:49.560> think

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
feelings on fusions I obviously think

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.860 
feelings on fusions I obviously think
they're<00:03:50.160> one<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.790> greatest<00:03:51.390> things<00:03:51.720> to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
they're one of the greatest things to

they're one of the greatest things to

I<00:04:31.919> feel<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.490> Dragon<00:04:32.940> Ball<00:04:33.060> super<00:04:33.240> has<00:04:33.539> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
I feel like Dragon Ball super has so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600 
I feel like Dragon Ball super has so
much<00:04:34.020> potential<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.740> feel<00:04:34.979> like<00:04:35.129> it<00:04:35.280> could<00:04:35.400> go

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
much potential I feel like it could go

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820 
much potential I feel like it could go
above<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.120> beyond<00:04:36.449> what<00:04:36.750> Dragon<00:04:37.229> Ball<00:04:37.379> Z<00:04:37.560> did

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
above and beyond what Dragon Ball Z did

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.189 
above and beyond what Dragon Ball Z did
however<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.490> am<00:04:38.639> very<00:04:39.150> concerned<00:04:39.389> because<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> do

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199
