that<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.020> difficult<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.620> imagine<00:02:29.710> for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that it's difficult to imagine for

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.890 
that it's difficult to imagine for
American<00:02:30.520> players<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> try<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.210> make<00:02:31.780> that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
American players to try and make that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780 
American players to try and make that
jump<00:02:32.170> between<00:02:32.500> playing<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.250> leagues<00:02:33.520> and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
jump between playing in your leagues and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.740 
jump between playing in your leagues and
then<00:02:33.880> moving<00:02:34.180> across<00:02:34.360> but<00:02:34.600> does<00:02:34.690> that

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
then moving across but does that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.740 
then moving across but does that
changing<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> little<00:02:35.440> bit<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.820> know<00:02:36.940> rugby<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
changing a little bit you know rugby the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.070 
changing a little bit you know rugby the
States<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.230> growing<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.570> some<00:02:40.570> some<00:02:40.810> small

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
States is growing and some some small

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.540 
States is growing and some some small
steps<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.750> we've<00:02:44.710> got<00:02:44.890> some<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:45.310> got<00:02:45.400> some

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
steps but for we've got some we got some

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.980 
steps but for we've got some we got some
good<00:02:45.700> athletes<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.330> some<00:02:46.630> good<00:02:46.780> rugby

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
good athletes and some good rugby

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.050 
good athletes and some good rugby
players<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.620> would<00:02:47.740> definitely<00:02:48.670> benefit

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
players that would definitely benefit

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.730 
players that would definitely benefit
from<00:02:49.210> being<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.630> full<00:02:49.810> time<00:02:49.870> environment<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.710> I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
from being a full time environment and I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.070 
from being a full time environment and I
think<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.100> given<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.210> opportunity<00:02:52.840> could

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
think that given the opportunity could

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
think that given the opportunity could
do<00:02:53.890> well<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.320> full-time<00:02:56.710> professional

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
do well in a full-time professional

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.250 
do well in a full-time professional
environment<00:02:57.790> but<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.180> there's<00:02:59.020> no<00:02:59.110> doubt

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
environment but the there's no doubt

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.590 
environment but the there's no doubt
that<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.590> jump<00:02:59.830> over<00:03:00.160> from<00:03:00.850> from<00:03:01.270> our<00:03:01.390> leagues

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
that the jump over from from our leagues

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.960 
that the jump over from from our leagues
in<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> u.s.<00:03:02.230> over<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> Premiership<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
in the u.s. over to the Premiership is a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.100 
in the u.s. over to the Premiership is a
big<00:03:04.240> jump<00:03:04.630> yeah

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
big jump yeah

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.300 
big jump yeah
but<00:03:05.320> hopefully<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.740> could<00:03:05.890> start<00:03:06.070> closing

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
but hopefully we could start closing

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.430 
but hopefully we could start closing
that<00:03:06.520> gap<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.730> bit<00:03:07.000> more<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.900> obviously<00:03:08.290> went

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
that gap a bit more you obviously went

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.080 
that gap a bit more you obviously went
back<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.860> played<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.280> US<00:03:09.610> after<00:03:09.910> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
things going on down there because

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.260 
things going on down there because
obviously<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.830> know<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.010> way<00:04:09.130> us<00:04:09.490> rugby

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
obviously you know the way us rugby

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.940 
obviously you know the way us rugby
works<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.780> different<00:04:11.230> structure<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.800> here

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
works that a different structure to here

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.340 
works that a different structure to here
in<00:04:12.220> England<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.150> University<00:04:13.750> puppies<00:04:14.080> that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
in England is University puppies that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.610 
in England is University puppies that
was<00:04:14.440> not<00:04:14.560> quite<00:04:14.710> an<00:04:14.890> important<00:04:15.610> I<00:04:15.850> think

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
was not quite an important I think

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.650 
was not quite an important I think
obviously<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.709> way<00:04:18.549> our<00:04:18.730> sports<00:04:19.060> culture<00:04:19.269> is

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
obviously the way our sports culture is

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.840 
obviously the way our sports culture is
like<00:04:20.170> you<00:04:20.350> said<00:04:20.560> very<00:04:20.920> different<00:04:21.340> where<00:04:21.489> you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
like you said very different where you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.030 
like you said very different where you
guys<00:04:21.940> are<00:04:22.000> primarily<00:04:22.780> based<00:04:22.900> around<00:04:23.320> clubs

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
guys are primarily based around clubs

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.170 
guys are primarily based around clubs
yeah<00:04:24.850> where<00:04:26.490> we're<00:04:27.490> unique<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.000> sense

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
yeah where we're unique in the sense

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.420 
yeah where we're unique in the sense
that<00:04:28.330> we<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:28.900> all<00:04:29.080> these<00:04:29.290> universities<00:04:30.070> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
that we have all these universities that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.150 
that we have all these universities that
that<00:04:31.240> fund<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.780> sponsor<00:04:32.440> our<00:04:32.590> sports<00:04:32.950> and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
that fund and sponsor our sports and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.340 
that fund and sponsor our sports and
think<00:04:33.910> once<00:04:34.120> rugby<00:04:34.600> really<00:04:35.020> takes<00:04:35.260> hold

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
think once rugby really takes hold

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.470 
think once rugby really takes hold
within<00:04:35.740> our<00:04:35.980> university<00:04:36.700> programs<00:04:37.180> that

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
within our university programs that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.200 
within our university programs that
you're<00:04:37.660> gonna<00:04:37.750> see<00:04:37.960> some<00:04:38.670> exponential<00:04:39.670> growth

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
you're gonna see some exponential growth

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.870 
you're gonna see some exponential growth
yeah<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.800> u.s.<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.280> mean<00:04:42.340> people<00:04:42.730> always

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
yeah in the u.s. I mean people always

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.610 
yeah in the u.s. I mean people always
say<00:04:43.150> there's<00:04:43.360> been<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.570> sleeping<00:04:44.020> giant<00:04:44.050> nation

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
say there's been a sleeping giant nation

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.470 
say there's been a sleeping giant nation

and I think one of maybe ten or so that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.110 
and I think one of maybe ten or so that
have<00:05:12.550> over<00:05:12.790> 50<00:05:13.120> caps<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.440> it's<00:05:15.400> been<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.640> very

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
have over 50 caps so it's been a very
