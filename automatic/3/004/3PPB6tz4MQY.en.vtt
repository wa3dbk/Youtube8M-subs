00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.450
 it's him the hustlers then the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 advice for this month this concerns 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.840
 the sky experience my bag that one 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.700
 found in the magazine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
 hustlers to do this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 hot air balloon from this house you go 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 have needs of the following equipment 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.650
 two bags to cover clothes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 that we usually find in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.619
 all good four-page cleaner big 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 format of a lighter of a pair of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 scissors the self-adhesive washers a 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.469
 felt pencil and of course 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 candles the first step is to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.660
 build something that will 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 allow a dose inserted support 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 little candles to be able to do 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 literally lift our bag on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 cleaning in the air then if you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.949
 want to do this step there just 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 take your straw and make a woman 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.120
 in one of these there and inserted 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 inside like this your straw for 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.210
 then it was necessary to mount next 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 so very simple once they are 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 was doing so we will have to cut our 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.689
 little candles using a pair of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.909
 scissors because the pond on enormously 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 important when making 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.450
 your hot air balloon must not be 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 too heavy for money to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 literally get the whole thing up so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 I advise you to cut the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.189
 half of your candles 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 once he went to see cut your little ones 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 candles you insert them into 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.200
 forms that you are going to have established 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this montage ci with the help of a pencil 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 marker and facilities where you 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.320
 can you use an exacto for 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 to make your ends look much better and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.649
 then just insert our 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.899
 small candles 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.799
 inside once we have installed 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.270
 all that I eat the rest ah yes 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.979
 I forgot 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.600
 when you go to use your bag of 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.630
 plastic to cherry you to make 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.450
 little alive holes of your scissors and y 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.610
 drop two washers stickers 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.440
 stickers on each side and then 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 you will take your bag 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.520
 and you will insert it into the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 glitter like these each one of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 tips once your editing done well 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.230
 you will notice that I added a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.670
 small rope 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.130
 obviously you can add a 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.170
 coil of wire so as to see again 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 more length to hold your 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.800
 hot air balloon once it has to be 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 in the air now all that 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.080
 still to do is turn on your 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:40.020
 candles can ask an adult 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:43.230
 since you play with fire and air 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.700
 hot will literally swell the 5 he 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.820

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.730
 rises in the sky 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:12.500
