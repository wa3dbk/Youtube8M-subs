00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello youtube media in this place already 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.879
 I'm going to show you blue short is that 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.460
 he does not use glue and it's very easy 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:16.330
 to make good let's see the materials 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 they will need an a4 sheet or a sheet 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 that have color 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.240
 then let's see the procedure 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.170
 let's take our sheet and we'll 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.170
 fold in half 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.850
 once classroom half we are going to fold 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.300
 this side back halfway I do not 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.300
 I did it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.180
 and back to this side to this side 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 you tackling back 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 now we unfold 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 a description of the split have to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 this side taking it to the middle or 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.340
 be towards the line that you have reported 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340
 previously 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.660
 a little less than half 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.010
 and not the most 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.710
 now we locate it now they are going to carry 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.710
 this side if you come here 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.100
 that is, it is forming like a triangle 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 and now it's the same on the other side 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.620
 once you have these tips for how 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.900
 form an imaginary line of bachata or 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.900
 yes and they are going to double it doing 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.790
 and the same thing on the other side they form the line 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.000
 unfolding and they will take the west side 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 towards here 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.769
 they give me their name 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.750
 which we had some rectangles 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.360
 stressed on 12 now let's form 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.069
 some lines so be within those 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.730
 squares 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.310
 red 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.300
 or on this side 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.440
 and it's going to be like this and this one is going to be 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.440
 there then 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.140
 from this point to this and the same 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.140
 this point towards this 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.210
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.830
 open this up like this 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.510
 and we go as an adult for this girl and she 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.710
 move our triangle is going to open 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.710
 and we will stay there 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:18.260
 we open we fold we crush and now it's 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.969
 with this line we lower it and so not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.969
 city ​​then 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.280
 now then this side of the mind 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.070
 thus making both as you see now 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 how they should put it inside and 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.150
 is going to be our line shape and is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.379
 that is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.379
 and the others for inside 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.890
 and now we put it patient 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.250
 in this way and we mark the doubles of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.820
 those above or the same as the center 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.370
 gone down 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.250
 and we show the smell 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.280
 and the last step is to double for this 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.870
 line that will get to the bottom of 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.860
 here then what is left to put it 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.170
 and we have finished our envelope 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.740
 Now if you want, you can decorate it with 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.700
 fibrones with pen with stamp with the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.700
 problems and in their 3 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.960
 and ready do not forget to put me like 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.730
 comment 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.340
 and good to subscribe and see you in the 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.340
 tutorial with more tutorials aíto there
