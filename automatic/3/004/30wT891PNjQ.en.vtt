I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> two<00:00:58.109> freshmen<00:00:58.500> aside<00:00:58.800> nothing

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I think the two freshmen aside nothing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
I think the two freshmen aside nothing
bored<00:00:59.670> three<00:00:59.969> freshmen<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.629> definite

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
bored three freshmen it's not definite

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.700 
bored three freshmen it's not definite
of<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.949> make<00:01:02.190> helpless<00:01:03.260> about<00:01:04.260> ten<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> half

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of that make helpless about ten a half

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
of that make helpless about ten a half
minutes<00:01:05.010> ago<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:06.150> tied<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> game<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:07.200> was

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
minutes ago they tied the game what was

big buried at that's not just I won't be
right<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> jump<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
right at that jump through just not the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
right at that jump through just not the
panic<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.479> know<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.869> some<00:01:19.200> teams<00:01:19.409> panic

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
panic you know I think some teams panic

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.850 
panic you know I think some teams panic
in<00:01:19.920> those<00:01:20.040> situations<00:01:20.700> but

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
in those situations but

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.770 
in those situations but
you<00:01:22.070> know<00:01:22.190> he<00:01:22.340> said<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.850> know<00:01:22.970> stay<00:01:23.390> steady

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and also AJ came in he hit a victory and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.730 
and also AJ came in he hit a victory and
I<00:01:32.450> thought<00:01:32.630> they<00:01:32.810> kind<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.050> got<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.200> place<00:01:33.440> one

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
I thought they kind of got a place one

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
love it Ronnie I asked the same thing I

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.120 
love it Ronnie I asked the same thing I
don't<00:01:40.900> fun<00:01:41.900> was<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.590> get<00:01:43.100> back
