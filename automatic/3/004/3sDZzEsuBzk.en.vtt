00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 welcome you to the channel designer 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.839
 decorations from Xenia today are gorgeous 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 pearls want to show you again and necklace 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.969
 she is quite simple then there is no one 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.540
 my special and designer fantasies 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.980
 No, but she just looks beautiful 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.869
 at the expense of pearls at the expense of him 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 means a combination of caliber means 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 a combination of color means I want 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.179
 show means here are pearls simple 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.120
 twigs for show I twisted them to you and 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.829
 here she is as a means stakes Stake 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 means on a large chain link I pinned 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 pearls of different size 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.239
 I had little pearls like this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.070
 extend a little bit on the chain because 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.059
 It turns out that these are the threads of small 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 pearls were shorter than large 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.430
 strands of pearls are therefore so small 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.469
 manipulation a little trick 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 so that everything is very beautiful and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 neatly large clasp as the stakes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.820
 very extensive and therefore requires a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.280
 very good tight buckle means 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 what interest in this necklace means it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.610
 you can wear and vylazhivat like that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.270
 the neck that is it does nothing but 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.259
 The trick is that you need to take it and here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.909
 so here twist that is to do from it 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.470
 here is such a spring 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.740
 turntable do not know what to call it means 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.259
 in such a way it turns and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 then laid out on the neck means here 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.720
 in this way with one hand a little bit 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 that is why to show it means that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 in such a way and twist it like 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.649
 you are comfortable that is you can do it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.710
 twist very much and then it will 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 it is straight dense and lie at 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.560
 and lying very near the neck tightly 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.270
 a little bit of it spin the chip is that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.909
 this is such 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.509
 can play with this with these pearl 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.410
 branches 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.650

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.849
 Immediately on him I got classes 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.670
