00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.130
 hi i'm the leader of the treemme modena club today and they teach me how to play 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.659
 gianfranco mascia 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.659
 one of the fantastic games of the goblins line 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.970
 you have to guide your family of frogs and from the other side of the pond 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.189
 being careful of the stork who is looking for a great lunch for the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.060
 day 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 after mounting the game following the instructions in the box 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.399
 it is necessary to mount color blind 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.830
 there is the stork face that that song 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.850
 the two faces of the leap of the horse even only the blue ones 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 the movement faces 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 downo 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.140
 at this point the youngest player starts the game by throwing dice 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 food let's go now to see which are the protagonists of this adventure 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 we have the stork 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 who walks around the pond looking for a lunch 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.470
 we have the pond 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.489
 in addition each player to 5 frogs that start from one side and must reach 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.489
 their home on the opposite side 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.530
 in the pond 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 everything is formed 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.280
 from three levels we have the bank 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.510
 the rocks and the bench 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.660
 the player with the highest score wins the game 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.500
 at times when player care brought all his frogs to the other 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.400
 part of the shore or none in part and the other part in part 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 have been eaten by lacicogna so let's say the game ends with a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.830
 player is no longer able to move any of his rare ones to that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 point there you count the points you see the player with the highest score 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 who will be the winner 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 of the game turn priest the player throws the die and in the following 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.380
 how many indicated by the I hold 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 if one holds the face with number one with the number 2 little number 3 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.970
 can move one of the strange ones 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.120
 in that number of squares the frogs can move 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.940
 in Horizon 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.370
 vertically and also diagonally 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.140
 they cannot cross squares occupied by other frogs and cannot 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 cross squares occupied by the stork 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.969
 if a player gets 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.369
 a face of the dice indicating the leap of the horse 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.330
 he will be able to make his mother run 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.939
 in jumps and as long as 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 this is possible let's take an example to understand 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.479
 for example I am a yellow player I keep jumping leapfrog at this 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.799
 point my frog will be able to execute 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.920
 a jump 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.269
 and skip the green wool and then another jump 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.549
 that skips ours 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.670
 it is never possible with the same jump to jump more in a frog so if me 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.309
 I was here with my yellow frog I couldn't 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.609
 perform a double jump of this type that cannot be skipped over 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.849
 stork 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.849
 if by throwing the dice you get orange and the stork 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.039
 it will be placed on the square occupied by a frog and the frog will be placed on it 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.169
 it will be removed from the game because it will no longer be able to participate because it has been 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.319
 eaten by lacicogna 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.099
 when the game ends then when a player has brought all the evenings 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.189
 on the other side in his house then 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.479
 or on the rock 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.469
 or on the bench I have on the bank 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.949
 and it has no bigger 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.619
 who can move the game ends 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.179
 to admire it 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.209
 that one was able to bring to the bench 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.959
 goalkeeper three points for each of its valley that the portal exit on the rock 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.779
 get 2 points for each frog that the portal exit on its own 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.160
 bank all in one place 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.599
 the player with the highest score wins the game 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.469
 like all the games of the line of the goblins also Franco is born and lends itself to 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.409
 several variants some are already proposed in the present moment in the 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.059
 box 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.859
 the first variant is called group jump and allows players to say 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.829
 some strategic tactical choices greater than the basic game 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.099
 when a player gets rode they invade hand between apple number 2 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.409
 he is not obliged to move 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.929
 a single branch of that number of boxes of that number of jumps but can 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:15.549
 let's also say mini live the movement points between two or more serious 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.549
 the second variant is called the stork's escape and is very simple 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.280
 a player after pulling from dolindo can decide instead of performing 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.300
 the action is shown on the seal face 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.490
 to recover one of his own frogs that had been eaten by lacicogna la 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.520
 takes elahly positions 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.740
 in one of the starting positions 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.110
 initial 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.349
 the third variant is called triple thrust and is designed specifically 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.349
 per game between players must rebuild 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.999
 the game board in this way 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.349
 all players will start from the same side they will have to reach 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.550
 the same parent company obviously positions 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.260
 more coveted will be limited one will certainly not have reserved places therefore 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.080
 even more important 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.599
 hurry to be the first to reach the seats on the bench 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.639
 fragrance is a game 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.889
 quite simple as rules but which let's say we apply some 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.800
 strategies some interesting things above all 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.629
 it is important to remember 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.069
 that the position on the bench is worth 3 points those on the rocks 2 those 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.009
 on the banks 1 so not only is it important to bring your own ramen from 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.839
 opposite side of the pond but it is also important to look at the rocco pare 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.730
 positions with the highest score 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.120
 it's obvious that 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.680
 and being a race against time because the game ends with just one 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.690
 player brought all his hands to the other side 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.949
 there is not always time to move a frog from the shore 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.800
 on the bench from the rock the bench then player will also have to evaluate 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.740
 based on the possibilities 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.009
 the eye of the adversaries 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.940
 how to position your dog 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.090
 the other special thing about this game is the leapfrog move 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.110
 that if a player manages to take advantage of the position of their own hands of 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.180
 those if the opponent on the map 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.490
 let's say in the final md part of the game with a frog can succeed too 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.400
 to cross the entire pond with one move, performing many jumps in 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.960
 sequence then we say also there is need to know how to position well the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.300
 own frogs to facilitate their own movement and not to facilitate too much 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.869
 the opponents 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:31.149
 fragmotion is a game for two 4 players starting at 7 years old 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:34.439
 game usually lasts between 10 and 20 minutes
