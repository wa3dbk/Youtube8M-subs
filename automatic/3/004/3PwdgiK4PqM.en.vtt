ok<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.960> iphone<00:00:01.410> 4<00:00:01.890> then<00:00:02.399> it's<00:00:03.060> not

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
ok so this iphone 4 then it's not

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.809 
ok so this iphone 4 then it's not
switching<00:00:03.510> on<00:00:03.780> because<00:00:04.430> it<00:00:05.430> doesn't<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
switching on because it doesn't have a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.509 
switching on because it doesn't have a
battery<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.680> another<00:00:07.680> reason<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.099> doesn't

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
battery in it another reason it doesn't

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.919 
battery in it another reason it doesn't
have<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.760> battery<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.389> because<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
have a battery in it is because of this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.459 
have a battery in it is because of this
big<00:00:10.290> gap<00:00:10.650> here<00:00:11.690> what's<00:00:12.690> happened<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.410> i

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
big gap here what's happened with this i

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.939 
big gap here what's happened with this i
think<00:00:14.070> i've<00:00:14.759> been<00:00:14.940> tired<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.299> memory<00:00:15.809> serves

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
think i've been tired if memory serves

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.150 
think i've been tired if memory serves
me<00:00:16.949> correctly<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.060> screen<00:00:18.630> has<00:00:19.080> been<00:00:19.590> changed

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
me correctly the screen has been changed

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.859 
me correctly the screen has been changed
or<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:21.180> could<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.390> been<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> battery

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
or it could have been just the battery

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.939 
or it could have been just the battery
but<00:00:22.800> anyway<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.720> battery<00:00:24.720> connector<00:00:25.260> has

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
but anyway the battery connector has

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
but anyway the battery connector has
been<00:00:26.160> ripped<00:00:26.519> off<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> main<00:00:27.000> bar<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.449> it's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
been ripped off the main bar now it's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009 
been ripped off the main bar now it's
quite<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> common<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:29.480> iphone<00:00:30.480> files<00:00:30.779> if

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
quite a common thing in iphone files if

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.330 
quite a common thing in iphone files if
you<00:00:31.260> take<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.489> bit<00:00:32.700> too<00:00:33.170> fast<00:00:34.340> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you take up a little bit too fast and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.000 
you take up a little bit too fast and
not<00:00:35.399> doing<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.510> gently<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.890> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
not doing not very gently it can just be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740 
not doing not very gently it can just be
ripped<00:00:38.280> straight<00:00:38.760> off<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.090> main<00:00:39.360> bar<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> i

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
ripped straight off the main bar and i

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
ripped straight off the main bar and i
think<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.140> what's<00:00:40.290> happened<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.980> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
think that's what's happened in this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.920 
think that's what's happened in this
case<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.000> soldered<00:00:45.329> back<00:00:45.690> on

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
case now they can be soldered back on

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
case now they can be soldered back on
it'll<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> difficult<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it'll be quite a difficult thing in the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.799 
it'll be quite a difficult thing in the
case<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:49.460> connector<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
case of this connector because of the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.670 
case of this connector because of the
two<00:00:52.170> middle<00:00:52.680> sort<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> dark<00:00:54.030> patches<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.870> if

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
two middle sort of dark patches there if

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520 
two middle sort of dark patches there if
it<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.280> silver<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:58.350> they're<00:00:58.469> not

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it should be silver but they're not

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
it should be silver but they're not
because<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> solder<00:00:59.399> pads<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.840> solder

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
because the solder pads that the solder

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.340 
because the solder pads that the solder
goes<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.300> electrical<00:01:03.780> contact

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
goes on to to make electrical contact

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
goes on to to make electrical contact
from<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> pad<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> connector<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.270> been

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
from the pad to the connector has been

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
from the pad to the connector has been
ripped<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.150> try

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
ripped off now I'm what I'm going to try

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.230 
ripped off now I'm what I'm going to try
is<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:12.210> solder<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> connectors

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
is to see if I can solder the connectors

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
is to see if I can solder the connectors
from<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> connector<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.409> anywhere<00:01:17.009> else<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
from the connector to anywhere else to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
from the connector to anywhere else to
make<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.700> work<00:01:17.880> i'm<00:01:18.509> guessing<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.170> gold

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
make them work i'm guessing the two gold

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.570 
make them work i'm guessing the two gold
dots<00:01:20.360> below<00:01:21.360> each<00:01:22.200> contact<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.280> good

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
dots below each contact would be good

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.020 
dots below each contact would be good
place<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> start<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.840> i'm<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.799> if

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
place to start so i'm going to see if

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
place to start so i'm going to see if
that<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> possible<00:01:27.890> i'm<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that is possible i'm going to have a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.260 
that is possible i'm going to have a
look<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:31.189> 60<00:01:32.189> times<00:01:32.369> magnifying<00:01:32.939> glass<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
look on a 60 times magnifying glass to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.080 
look on a 60 times magnifying glass to
see<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.950> anything<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.579> done<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
see if anything could be done with that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
see if anything could be done with that
and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.450> we'll<00:01:36.750> move<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and then we'll move on so we have the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
and then we'll move on so we have the
iphone<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> needs<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:42.409> battery

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
iphone for now that needs the battery

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
iphone for now that needs the battery
connector<00:01:43.890> replacing<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> camp<00:01:44.970> here

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
connector replacing as the camp here

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.560 
connector replacing as the camp here
what<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.149> there's<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
what this is going to go and there's the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
what this is going to go and there's the
contact<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.380> i'm<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> worse<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
contact on it i'm just going to worse on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.020 
contact on it i'm just going to worse on
a<00:01:50.579> 10<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.020> solder<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:53.340> i<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.880> be

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
a 10 with some solder then i will be

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.679 
a 10 with some solder then i will be
putting<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.540> place<00:01:54.890> where<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.009> needs<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> go

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
putting in place where it needs to go

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
putting in place where it needs to go
solder<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> down<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.090> points<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> i<00:02:00.270> can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
solder it down to the points that i can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.459 
solder it down to the points that i can
do<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> other<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.930> we<00:02:03.930> need<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
do and then the other two we need to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
do and then the other two we need to
ruin

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
ruin

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.630 
ruin

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the gold dots just behind them bad see

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210 
the gold dots just behind them bad see
if<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.250> some<00:02:20.310> power<00:02:20.730> into<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:22.220> iphone

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
if we can get some power into the iphone

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.360 
if we can get some power into the iphone
from<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.150> new<00:02:24.390> battery<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.160> won't

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
from a new battery and then we won't

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.770 
from a new battery and then we won't
move<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> front<00:02:27.150> row<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.480> battery

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
move on the front row the battery

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
move on the front row the battery
connector<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.260> kind<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> half<00:02:28.830> way<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.520> at<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
connector is kind of half way in at the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.210 
connector is kind of half way in at the
moment<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.630> two<00:02:30.810> outer<00:02:31.110> contacts<00:02:31.800> are<00:02:32.010> sold

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
moment the two outer contacts are sold

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.600 
moment the two outer contacts are sold
it<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.540> there's<00:02:33.540> nothing<00:02:33.900> far<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.860> inner<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it in there's nothing far the inner to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.110 
it in there's nothing far the inner to
contact<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.270> solder<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.910> what<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.000> going

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
contact to solder to so what I'm going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.449 
contact to solder to so what I'm going
to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.269> doing<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.720> extending<00:02:40.080> some<00:02:40.680> wire<00:02:41.010> from

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to be doing is extending some wire from

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.470 
to be doing is extending some wire from
the<00:02:41.519> two<00:02:41.760> gold<00:02:42.030> dots<00:02:43.160> right<00:02:44.160> behind<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the two gold dots right behind the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.210 
the two gold dots right behind the
contacts<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.760> contacts<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.480> they<00:02:48.630> can

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
contacts to the contacts so they can

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.190 
contacts to the contacts so they can
electrically<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.790> connected<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.450> then

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
electrically get connected and then

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.070 
electrically get connected and then
hopefully<00:02:52.769> we<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> get<00:02:53.190> some<00:02:53.250> power<00:02:53.580> into<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
hopefully we can get some power into the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.380 
hopefully we can get some power into the
iphone<00:02:55.410> from<00:02:56.010> any<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:56.610> okay<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.030> if<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.269> can

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
iphone from any about okay so if you can

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.009 
iphone from any about okay so if you can
see<00:02:57.720> there<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.290> left<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.640> two<00:03:00.480> contacts

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
see there the left of the two contacts

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.670 
see there the left of the two contacts
in<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:02.130> center<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.720> were<00:03:04.200> sort<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
in the center that is now were sort of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.880 
in the center that is now were sort of
bridged<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.310> gap<00:03:06.110> was<00:03:07.110> looking<00:03:07.470> good<00:03:07.500> nice

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
bridged that gap was looking good nice

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.729 
bridged that gap was looking good nice
and<00:03:08.130> strong<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.330> what<00:03:09.750> I'm<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> do<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
and strong so what I'm going to do the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.600 
and strong so what I'm going to do the
same<00:03:10.769> or<00:03:11.519> two<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.180> next<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.720> and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
same or two and the one next to it and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.800 
same or two and the one next to it and
then<00:03:14.610> we<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.910> hopefully<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.299> some<00:03:15.360> battery

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
then we can hopefully get some battery

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110 
then we can hopefully get some battery
power<00:03:16.070> back<00:03:17.070> into<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> iphone<00:03:17.549> there<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.090> are

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
power back into the iphone there we are

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.990 
power back into the iphone there we are
with<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:19.019> second<00:03:20.299> contact<00:03:21.299> sort<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:21.989> extended

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
with the second contact sort of extended

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.850 
with the second contact sort of extended
I<00:03:24.000> will<00:03:24.420> say<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.930> are<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> prettiest

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
I will say they are not the prettiest

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.610 
I will say they are not the prettiest
saw<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.340> giants<00:03:26.760> I've<00:03:26.910> ever<00:03:27.150> formed<00:03:27.660> when<00:03:28.500> I'm

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
saw the giants I've ever formed when I'm

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.250 
saw the giants I've ever formed when I'm
hoping<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.540> function<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.140> be

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
hoping that function is going to be

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.860 
hoping that function is going to be
restored<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.370> get<00:03:32.489> some<00:03:32.820> power<00:03:33.390> moving

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
restored so we can get some power moving

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
restored so we can get some power moving
again<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:35.040> next<00:03:35.190> time<00:03:35.400> i'm<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.730> going<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.880> be

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
again so next time i'm just going to be

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.780 
again so next time i'm just going to be
putting<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.660> brand-new<00:03:37.079> battery<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.010> then

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
putting in a brand-new battery and then

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.099 
putting in a brand-new battery and then
we'll<00:03:38.910> switch<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.269> again<00:03:39.510> okay<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.049> can

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
we'll switch on again okay as you can

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.680 
we'll switch on again okay as you can
see<00:03:40.200> here<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.739> battery<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.820> its<00:03:42.120> clipped

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
see here the battery is in its clipped

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.080 
see here the battery is in its clipped
down<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.380> connector<00:03:43.920> now<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.609> oppressed<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
down the connector now as oppressed it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.009 
down the connector now as oppressed it
down<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:46.079> all<00:03:46.230> felt<00:03:46.470> good<00:03:46.760> felt<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.480> a

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
down it all felt good felt just like a

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.780 
down it all felt good felt just like a
normal<00:03:49.380> connector<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.370> hasn't<00:03:50.760> been

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
normal connector that hasn't been

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.210 
normal connector that hasn't been
damaged<00:03:51.390> what<00:03:52.109> I'm<00:03:52.260> checking<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.859> now<00:03:53.070> just

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
damaged what I'm checking for now just

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.930 
damaged what I'm checking for now just
by<00:03:53.400> touching<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.420> checking<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:54.810> heat

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
by touching it and was checking for heat

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.210 
by touching it and was checking for heat
from<00:03:56.940> any<00:03:57.450> power<00:03:57.750> sort<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.410> shortage<00:03:58.920> that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
from any power sort of shortage that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.300 
from any power sort of shortage that
might<00:04:00.000> exist<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.540> can't<00:04:00.750> really<00:04:00.930> see<00:04:01.140> how<00:04:01.980> well

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
might exist I can't really see how well

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.610 
might exist I can't really see how well
something<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.090> exist<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:03.870> i'm

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
something like that would exist but i'm

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.190 
something like that would exist but i'm
just<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.220> lookout<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.579> that

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
just going to be on the lookout for that

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.050 
just going to be on the lookout for that
i've<00:04:07.200> not<00:04:07.440> screwed<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.160> connected<00:04:08.760> down

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
i've not screwed the connected down

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.580 
i've not screwed the connected down
yet<00:04:09.590> let's<00:04:10.590> take<00:04:10.830> out<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.099> really<00:04:11.550> don't<00:04:12.590> have

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
yet let's take out I really don't have

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.539 
yet let's take out I really don't have
to<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.730> I'm<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.120> switch<00:04:15.300> it<00:04:15.510> on<00:04:15.630> now

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
to so I'm just going to switch it on now

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.129 
to so I'm just going to switch it on now
if<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.850> any<00:04:18.060> power<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.660> battery

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
is power in the battery so it allowed me

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.540 
is power in the battery so it allowed me
to<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:46.889> that<00:04:47.930> now<00:04:48.930> what<00:04:49.139> I'm<00:04:49.229> going<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.410> do<00:04:49.560> is

now<00:05:01.639> just<00:05:02.639> looking<00:05:02.910> right<00:05:02.940> out<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:04.070> battery

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
now just looking right out the battery

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.180 
now just looking right out the battery
