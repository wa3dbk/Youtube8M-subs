00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:20.170
 but he 's just as boy and that's why 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.060
 We are what you need to

 two tablespoons of honey for the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.790
 fruits we need a peach in cubes 6 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.399
 strawberries in quarters 1 teaspoon 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.130

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.870
 quarter cup of coconut grated so tan 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.440
 so so so so now a short step by 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 please my company 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.090
 and we will give the first tapioca 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.850
 are these I have them we do on this side 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.129
 and what we are going to earn as pearls 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.170
 exactly we will place them for 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.909
 moisturize and treat them with warm water 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 that is the first step the first step 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.960
 this very simple recipe is to hydrate with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.240
 warm water and then what will happen here 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.250
 neither cold nor hot warm real and ctera 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.780
 them from lukewarm exactly my company I think 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 that you have some very questions 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.270
 natural in such a relaxed way that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.619
 You took it for example, what is it? 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.450
 some white pearls that have a 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.060
 first a much firmer texture 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.009
 later but I do not know how where 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.420
 get in the supermarket of course 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.130
 and and as regards average weights 30 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 kilo it might seem like I'm failing 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.759
 to the taste of dreams because it 's a little 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.679
 colder is a little more expensive than the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.780
 rice but you know it yields much more 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.300
 because in lady because lady corner and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.100
 because sir at home I imagined that you are 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.690
 pearls are like piolin in this 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.869
 chapter where later he took the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.369
 potion and science as rich so you will see 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.700
 the nurseries here we have it well 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.500
 little potion there is delicious now 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.890
 then it happened second after half 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.110
 My friend, let's give magic home 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.849
 that is the result lady so goes to 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.619
 be daily as it is piolin grown 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.270
 Well that's how it's going to be 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.880
 you in this way is how you do 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.970
 after that now we are going to take longer 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.220
 He did not arrive with his huaraches and they pay 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 he wanted me and with my egg box with 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 the ingredients and innovate and give it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.680
 cooking to the big very simple lady 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 simply you are going to place after 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.069
 that he let it hydrate half an hour 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.440
 the tapioca that is the result that 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.060
 we have here we are going to add milk that if 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.040
 wants and we get thicker could 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 being almond milk will also come 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.370
 it may be an option but algae can be 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.830
 low-fat milk or light milk 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.989
 we added for that reason could also 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.480
 be milk too of course because it does not 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.400
 add honey now to give it flavor and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.860
 now the tapioca arrives and hydrate 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 my company there is nothing, we're going 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.000
 to add and here we are going to leave 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.319
 cooking more or less 15 minutes because 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.930
 after it is well hydrated my 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.090
 Rich esteem does not cost so much work 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.709
 milk depending on how you liked the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.989
 rice pudding likes broth cited 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.030
 then let's put water on it let's forgive 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.620
 enough milk to cover it perfectly 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.930
 if we like more equipment but we put it 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.659
 except there will be 15 minutes left but 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.790

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.090
 texture to this recipe we agree 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.370
 let's encourage this special texture by 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.989
