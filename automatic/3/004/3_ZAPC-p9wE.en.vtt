00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.089
 The plan is here with another video 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.150
 and this time we are here in the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.730
 our baby texture where you help 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.160
 human spock to make a texture for the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 our minecraft galera and it's been a while since 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 I can not explain why you're new to the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 channel and for those who do not remember how that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.540
 makes you help a stock lets you 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 lilic cock in the video of a spock and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 also post here in comments 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.520
 the block you want to be made a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 I agree, people, look, just look at the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.620
 both of which had orchard 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.719
 sport finish the mobiles I am 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.510
 ending with calm people since it is not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.670
 easy to make the furniture aggressive right 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.350
 passive furniture is easier 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.710
 because they have more space 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 The skeleton took me an old hand. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.629
 but there was also a certain mix 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 in him that you will understand and I hope 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.760
 that you like is alright so I go 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
 change with him had to run to whoever 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
 do not know is that it's new to the channel and 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.930
 hence my world of textures galera 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 where it was textured, I 'm 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.790
 thinking about re-presenting textures 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.220
 to bring textures to you that I 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 I like my opinion about textures 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.939
 I want to know if you want if you guys 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.150
 Do you want me to resubmit? 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.180
 post textures here in comments 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.140
 hashtag spock can texture that's right or 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 just texture so let's go 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.119
 I worked here, I'll be part of it. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.030
 over here our part was for who 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.740
 You do not know , it's good here, it's you. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 still raining down here I knew 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 so I 'm going to do the guys, I'm going 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.890
 be there a skeleton here for you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.399
 see what this skeleton looks like, but I think 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.659
 that I am in that he free o look alone 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.850
 This is the arch and skeleton of the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 Our texture guys I do not know if I 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.599
 I lay with that with that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.730
 depth is right so I can 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.390
 here in the comments if you want the bow 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.060
 with depth or not 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.400
 the skeleton I was based on the face of the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 so right I stepped on it with a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.810
 Mouth to be fine in the hour 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.580
 Clip is the ugly one I'm trying to do 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.069
 clip more that is not the curriculum 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.610
 Our texture is fine, it's not the club. 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.070
 losing our texture is quiet and here 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.350
 this is the skeleton of our texture I 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.630
 I made him with his mouth, his arm has 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.030
 There's a lot of space here. 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 a joint appeared in the leg 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 I also think it's cool and we have 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.390
 more of a kind of skeleton in our 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.459

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.170
 lag no we go to the middle looks 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.480

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.400

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.709
