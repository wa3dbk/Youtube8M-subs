00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.679
 as it calls for the inclusion of sinama which means that Brazil is already Wednesday 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 rock edition in rio school 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.409
 there are more children 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.329
 there are more people demanding 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.829
 there is more time 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 Who is better? 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.170
 denominated 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.140
 we want it to give itself greater fragility that is commercial part 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 grapevine 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 more details 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.699
 have the word back to the field to compete the Internet users 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
 so we've been here for two years since arriving in são paulo 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.010
 It's a work that faces 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.260
 - certainly the most 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.730
 so if you reader 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.030
 he could have given interviews with some songs 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.340
 Paulo Simões with a lot of soul 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.540
 on the portal g1 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.540
 I was anxious 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.100
 I do not want to say anything 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 I do not deserve this for me 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 there's no denying 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
 in any neighborhood of freedom 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.749
 various 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.670
 the premiere 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.390
 Let's wait, it does not lead to anything. 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.590
 I'm not going there in the year 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.409
 paulo rabello 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.730
 so we're looking for is the same number 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.899
 on sunday march 11 - barbarous amaro ford he worked hard to do 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.129
 reversing the direction observed in the year 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 magno 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.439
 Paulo 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.780
 for now I think it's something that you do not have that the doorman 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.469
 wilson seconds is not 28 years old 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.829
 everything starts generating already has a unique doll career 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.979
 soon sad then because at the beginning of the year it counts on foreign artists 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.149
 A lot of people talk a lot about it, but this 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.919
 world 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.069
 with the money he got on his cell phone to get sad about being a boy 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.789
 trade pass their potential pms of the country's resales would be these countries 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.959
 the former players 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.989
 thousands of people have passed through the new city that we have to respect already 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.319
 countries had been frozen at least two more visions 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.219
 large 23 - 42 - victor d 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.279
 so I think it is that in 2012
