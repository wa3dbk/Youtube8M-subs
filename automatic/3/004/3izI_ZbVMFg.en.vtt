00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.679
 hello from diego welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.839
 finally we are in my kingdom 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.190
 we want to finally make the protagonist 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.529
 this in this kitchen 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.509
 beautiful Sicilian rancia good labin 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.579
 fantastic shrimp hermitage a 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.320
 a salad of celery paintings is a 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.890
 basmati rice flavored with citrus fruits e 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 ginger 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 well we put it to boil some water 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 for basmati rice we begin to punish ourselves 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 prawns in shrimp cleaning vi 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.559
 I recommend keeping the carapace apart and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 the heads that we will then need to do 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 an encore and I recommend always cleaning 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.600
 the intestine and which is in this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.600
 here part of the shrimp on the back 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 we have also joined our shells 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.170
 as it goes with the heads we have purged it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 we have raised all these impurities 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 we will need them to make an encore what is one 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 mix bis which is in practice a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.050
 flavor concentrate given by the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.570
 carapace and shell and head of 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.550
 prawns make you a smell of smells 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.190
 as usual instead of frying then 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.500
 they fit inside our shells 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.210
 in this case it is an orange bis 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.210
 instead of using the tomato use the rai 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.240
 well rice is ready 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.240
 scoliamo 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.850
 and stir in a little salted butter 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.800
 well let's fry our own 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.730
 carapace with odors 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.320
 let's wait for the water to dry a little 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:55.090
 of our crustaceans and at that point 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:02:00.330
 flamiano with some cognac we leave 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.330
 evaporate the alcohol and press an orange 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.600
 at this point we should add some 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.340
 broth or hot water in this 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 in case I use the same water as 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 cooking rice that released me 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.020
 of love he slept to tie more 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 this sauce while rice is still 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.390
 hot after whipping it with del 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 salted butter 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.070
 I want to give a further citrus note 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.470
 to the rice itself I will therefore use the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.110
 untreated oranges of am and gene 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:36.290
 gen and a ginger root using 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 only the rinds this bis is ready 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.770
 this is a cream that can be 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.110
 served both as a soup and also 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.530
 as something decorative then the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.360
 density that is given to our cream is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.040
 proportional to our use to me 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 need a pretty tight drop a lot 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.370
 dense to make blessings 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.989
 reach has basmati rice i thought of 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 a heart of celery flavored with 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.220
 of the evening together of mint and some 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:06.440
 of oil ginger and sprinkle of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:12.010
 line non-stick frying pan olive oil e 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.010
 we cook the prawns any prawns 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.030
 I recommend the shrimp must stay 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.939
 really very little time in the pan is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.189
 just enough time to let him take one 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:27.730
 gilding to hold this lasting 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.730
 at this point a blaze also to them 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:45.349
 fresh parsley salt and shrimp are 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.030
 just all our preparations 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.620
 they are ready 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.299
 we are on the chin then 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.760
 let's proceed with ours 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.799
 we risk pressing it a little inside 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.349
 keep a compact and sa latin shape 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.670
 of celery this is the gambling den we have 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.109
 prepared first name if they will not come 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.510
 so you can use it for one 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:13.849
 seal a greater decoration 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.299
 precise look at what we act 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.299
 obtained 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.170
 let's see the prawns and put them on 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.170
 poppy seeds 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.070
 in the last few lower volumes e 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:45.610
 of the radicchio of Chioggia and of the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.990
 small cena of siena tension for the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.910
 plate is ready the rancia with 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.840
 the combination with shrimp obviously the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.580
 my interpretation 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.530
 you are free to use the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.660
 meat and other types of fish that concerns 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.970
 the orange is all very versatile yes 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.460
 lends to 2000 interpretations in addition to 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.410
 my note pastry taste 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.600
 I hope you enjoyed this dish 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.190
