00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
into my office the other day and so I I

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.930 
into my office the other day and so I I
think<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.769> think<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:15.980> it's<00:04:16.220> very<00:04:16.310> likely<00:04:16.729> that

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
think I think that it's very likely that

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.930 
think I think that it's very likely that
I'll<00:04:17.209> be<00:04:17.329> working<00:04:18.099> back<00:04:19.099> at<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> same<00:04:19.609> place

I'll be working back at the same place

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.390 
I'll be working back at the same place
but<00:04:20.659> in<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.959> different<00:04:21.289> capacity<00:04:21.380> than<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
but in a different capacity than a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:31.330 
but in a different capacity than a
surgeon

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.949

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:40.959 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:45.559 

there<00:04:41.959> we<00:04:42.199> go

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.850 

this<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.379> basically<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.919> handicap<00:04:47.639> remodel

the<00:05:38.249> house<00:05:38.399> does<00:05:39.360> require<00:05:39.719> a<00:05:39.809> trip<00:05:40.080> outside

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
the house does require a trip outside

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.909 
the house does require a trip outside
and<00:05:40.949> a<00:05:41.039> ramp<00:05:41.699> so<00:05:42.379> it's<00:05:43.379> a<00:05:43.499> little<00:05:43.709> bit<00:05:43.800> isolated

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
and a ramp so it's a little bit isolated

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.600 
and a ramp so it's a little bit isolated
right<00:05:44.550> now<00:05:44.819> but<00:05:45.559> it's<00:05:46.559> a<00:05:46.769> space<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.189> come<00:05:47.369> home

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
right now but it's a space to come home

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.809 
right now but it's a space to come home
to<00:05:47.849> and<00:05:48.149> a<00:05:48.209> lot<00:05:48.360> of<00:05:48.479> people<00:05:48.809> in<00:05:48.990> my<00:05:49.139> condition

they<00:05:53.009> come<00:05:53.219> home<00:05:54.110> I'm<00:05:55.110> hoping<00:05:55.649> that<00:05:56.009> I<00:05:57.439> can<00:05:58.439> see

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
they come home I'm hoping that I can see

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.170 
they come home I'm hoping that I can see
the<00:05:59.279> opportunity<00:05:59.939> and<00:06:00.209> not<00:06:00.449> being<00:06:00.749> dead<00:06:01.129> and

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
the opportunity and not being dead and

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:10.540 
the opportunity and not being dead and
that's<00:06:03.180> yes<00:06:03.959> that's<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:05.009> thing<00:06:05.249> that<00:06:07.189> yet<00:06:08.899> yet

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
that's yes that's the thing that yet yet
