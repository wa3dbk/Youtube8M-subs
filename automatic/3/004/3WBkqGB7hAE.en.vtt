00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 one two three 4 5 today we will conjure 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.150
 Like put rather a friend with a rhyme with 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
 childhood i am friends 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.580
 yes hello everyone with you bender and today I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 I would like to tell you about the magic 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.680
 mod that will add maykroft integers 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 nine magic wands 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.470
 rescued chick who will help you in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
 different situations 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.630
 sticks of these 9 and they all possess 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 completely different effects and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.769
 opportunities so let me tell you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.199
 how they work will begin with perhaps here 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 such a stick at the end of which is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.329
 green knob I would be exactly the hero 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.360
 called actually but this one is called 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 stick and stick of vegetation or as 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.790
 so 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.879
 plus or minus I roughly translated correctly 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.100
 probably and how does it work working on 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.270
 on just enough deserted 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 almost anywhere you can 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.010
 use but as soon as you run through 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 like vegetation or to weight you with 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.590
 using can not grow for example 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.109
 grass 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.359
 yes yes it was grass that they took and grow 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.059
 grass or flowers can also 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.400
 use on different interesting 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 reeds yes here you can 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 grow about such a giant reed 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 how it works just activate it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 along the cane until she 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 will end or you won't get bored yes with 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.860
 creative mode and all these sticks through 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.170
 some time has the property of llama 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.570
 and so we look further further here 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.480
 such a stick and as I understand it 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.400
 stick helps harvest like this 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.650
 here you are and activate here like this 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.450
 Recently, many say, and you 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.180
 can harvest a large amount of harvest 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.310
 using her handy stick 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.350
 if you love gardening and you 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.780
 a huge garden with which you grow 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.030
 pumpkins and stuff other stuff but 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.160
 constantly handles to collect enough 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.620
 uncomfortable and long and with the help of this 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.259
 sticks question so here pass and all 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.390
 I think your harvest is excellent 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.670
 wand and in my opinion as far as I remember 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.930
 crafting it just enough acres 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.750
 so i will tell at the end 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.090
 so next we have a stick is a stick 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.860
 treatment it works very simply by 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.960
 to the principle of the potion how will it be 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.920
 it turns out you just take and 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.050
 activate it 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.500
 and in the direction where you direct your 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.080
 wand as if the hand you studied 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.690
 release mudflows and this potion treats everyone 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
 who will be next cult whether what 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.459
 then mobs be your friends general 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.680
 pretty cool stick and then 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.630
 the next wand will help you walk on 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 water but not really really about water 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 and on the ice 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 this wand will be able to freeze 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.250
 freeze the water and so here you are 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.950
 be able to make yourself masks and go 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.140
 river or fall into the river in general 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.140
 pretty cool wand not usually 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.660
 she looks and works fine but here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 next wand i'm friends displeased 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.930
 this wand which is called wand 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.120
 dig or wand company or something 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.700
 so how does she work with her you 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.670
 fast enough you can dig different 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.970
 materials whether stone 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.099
 something else yes it's fast enough 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.349
 but she also breaks they will be told too 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.930
 really fast for a long time and and not 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.090
 enough so basically I would say 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.700
 what is it a little useless wand 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.550
 better old-fashioned shovels to pick 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.800
 but the next stick is much better than 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.530
 previous in my opinion it will allow 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.420
 you teleport like a real 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 endermen using her for a while 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.880
 take and so quickly get on 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.860
 then voila tree we are already here we are true 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.989
 were in the block but that's okay 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.750
 how it works, I think itâ€™s understandable here and 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.660
 just using start eye enter a 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.489
 in the direction where you direct and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.069
 teleport right there enough 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.269
 handy thing anywhere in pvp or just 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.340
 travel around the world 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.730
 you can use it to climb 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.360
 just like a piece just took and cactus 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.940
 closer 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.010
 but it was all quite peaceful 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.380
 sticks that is somehow they 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.260
 used for peaceful purposes for mining 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.230
 resources either growing and so on 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.010
 next same sticks they are dangerous they are for 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.100
 killings 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.180
 for dirty killing other players 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.910
 either mova 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.070
 and 1 stick we will shoot 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.410
 arrows like this this is yo 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.250
 arrows as a bow with the help 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.769
 her you can 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.049
 shoot many many many arrows arrows 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.330
 accordingly, they themselves do not need it 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.700
 tedx creates materializes and with the help 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.979
 Then you will be able to kill somebody, 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.760
 who don't you like let's spawn 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.800
 here Belozerov I mean, that's such 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.479
 how funny it is not to talk and so on 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.729
 Whether spawn trying to kill them with 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.680
 this stick with 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.050
 and voila che and some time they 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.839
 really dying she is not much but 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.479
 nevertheless great sticks and so 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:48.339
 the next regiment launches us yes it 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.129
 exactly what else you thought it 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:53.889
 fireball fireball that ignites 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.020
 enemies explode a little bit and in general 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.449
 quite cool but what next 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.900
 wand is called death wand and 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.059
 I understand she removes 1 damage. 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.490
 with one blow she kills anyone 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:08.860
 anytime and anywhere ie you 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.029
 just run and target and see five 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.389
 your goal is dying 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:15.490
 very cool wand really common 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.620
