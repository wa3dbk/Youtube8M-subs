 Welcome to set up in this short 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 video very quickly we will teach you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.300
 how to share the internet of our 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.120
 cellular with other devices either 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 another pc on our laptop or other 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.529
 mobile phones tablets or any 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 mobile device that has 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.830
 settings do not have access to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 internet via wifi Scola 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.500
 through that configuration what 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.050
 we do is convert our phone 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.510
 wifi on a router a router that goes to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 have a name and password 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.309
 then we must activate the wifi theme 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.430
 activate the option to share internet 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.350
 and besides that, configure the name and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 the password that we are going to give to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.250
 our friends then the first thing that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.239
 we must do is the following 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 subscribe to our channel so that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.510
 Stay tuned to all our new 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 videos and we can leave questions 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 comments suggestions and visit 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 our website tax plans 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 puntocom where is the rest videos that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 we have climbed and the new ones that we are going to go 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.410
 going up then first challenge we are 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.110
 here by configuration 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 very important to keep in mind that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.960
 what we are going to share is our plan 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.000
 of data we are not going to share wifi it would be 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 illogical if not then the other people then 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.990
 would connect to the wifi that is available 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.229
 then the wifi of the start is active or 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.810
 because the wifi is supposed to and we're going to 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.579
 share our mobile data 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.480
 then deactivating the same fighting 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.400
 we are here because of the option that I made the most 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.740
 in the option that I did most we entered 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 team the option that calls it terry or 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 WIFI zone 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.079
 and ready and then here we say area of 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:42.380
 wireless access we click to 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.090
 activate it immediately activates 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.790
 we must configure it since we must 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.820
 give it a name 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.890
 and a password we speak click here 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 in this case this is called android app 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.350
 to put in addition to android for 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.570

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:14.550
 password that has to be at least 8 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.170
 low we regulate keep and ready here he 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.630
 It tells me how many devices there are 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 connected in the moment I already believe here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.850
 a notification that tells me that I'm 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830

 let's see what networks look for 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.390
 to put it I'll look for available as 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.900

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.440
 it's called android 300 simply 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.020
 we click here in this network 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.620
 dale click on the network give the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.920
 password that we create 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.489
 when showing password that was to that d 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.300

 we give him ready 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.540
 and we wait 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.840
