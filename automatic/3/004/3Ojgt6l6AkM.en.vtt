00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
which is really nice I wouldn't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.950 
which is really nice I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.090> running<00:01:09.540> I'd<00:01:09.689> recommend

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
recommend them for running I'd recommend

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
recommend them for running I'd recommend
them<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.260> cross<00:01:10.650> training<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:13.580> trail<00:01:14.580> running

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
them for cross training or trail running

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
them for cross training or trail running
would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.390> better<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
would be much better I do a lot of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.249 
would be much better I do a lot of
concrete<00:01:16.950> running<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.970> half<00:01:18.570> marathons<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
concrete running I do half marathons and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
concrete running I do half marathons and
marathons<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> stuff<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.720> if<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.869> going

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
marathons and stuff so if you're going

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.039 
marathons and stuff so if you're going
to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.320> get<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> bikila<00:01:23.150> ib<00:01:24.150> kila<00:01:24.420> LS<00:01:24.720> or

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to do that get the bikila ib kila LS or

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
to do that get the bikila ib kila LS or
one<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> those<00:01:25.680> shoes<00:01:26.040> I'd<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:27.000> better

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
one of those shoes I'd be much better

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.179 
one of those shoes I'd be much better
for<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.710> these<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.040> much

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
for that and see these are much

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.710 
for that and see these are much
different<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> different<00:01:30.390> tread

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
different they have a different tread

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.230 
different they have a different tread
pattern<00:01:31.049> they're<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> truck

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
pattern they're kind of like the truck

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810 
pattern they're kind of like the truck
sports<00:01:34.280> because<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
sports because they have a little bit of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.990 
sports because they have a little bit of
a<00:01:36.030> grip<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> camera

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a grip right here so I get the camera

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.780 
a grip right here so I get the camera
focus<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.860> they

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
focus on it all right right there they

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.940 
focus on it all right right there they
got<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.150> tread<00:01:42.600> pattern<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
got more tread pattern on the back and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.460 
got more tread pattern on the back and
they're<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.490> better<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:45.030> dirt<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:46.290> don't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
they're much better on dirt you don't

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
they're much better on dirt you don't
slide<00:01:46.770> around<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.159> dirt<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.700> much<00:01:47.880> more

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

as you do any other shoes but uh it has

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.570 
as you do any other shoes but uh it has
a<00:02:06.570> newer<00:02:06.920> structure<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.039> thur<00:02:08.160> thumps

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
a newer structure on thur thumps

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.089 
a newer structure on thur thumps
material<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> top<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.800> you've<00:02:10.920> got<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
material on the top and if you've got a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.120 
material on the top and if you've got a
real<00:02:11.340> high<00:02:11.520> arch<00:02:12.260> which<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.410> do

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
real high arch which I do

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.910 
real high arch which I do
this<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.660> much<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.380> flexible

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
this right here is much more flexible

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
this right here is much more flexible
than<00:02:16.980> other<00:02:17.310> shoes<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.940> fits<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.330> month

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
than other shoes so it fits in month

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.740 
than other shoes so it fits in month
within<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.670> beguiling<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.240> your<00:02:21.360> arch<00:02:21.540> will

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
within the beguiling so your arch will

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.250 
within the beguiling so your arch will
fit<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.110> better<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:24.020> they're<00:02:25.020> really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
fit in there better and they're really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.650 
fit in there better and they're really
good<00:02:25.410> shoes<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> mean<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.370> do<00:02:26.660> want

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
good shoes I mean if you do want

something like a mix between the Vic ela

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.620 
something like a mix between the Vic ela
and<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.120> check<00:02:30.300> sport<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:31.650> get<00:02:31.770> these<00:02:31.950> um
