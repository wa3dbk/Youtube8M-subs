 very large dynasty although good is 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.179
 important that all the people know 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.750
 the origins that you have I would like 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:33.390
 know a virtue that you have as good 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 I am a fighter of the people 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.310
 as a person I think that 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.990
 that always delayed and waits for 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.290
 vessel with sun 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.369
 another question that also makes me 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.729
 interesting of your character detected that 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.729
 I have 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.840
 but good that would be very good but as 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.610
 fighter I do not know I can not tell you 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 I think the public is the one who decides what 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.130
 you know if any defect I have until 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.890
 Now I have not perceived it with many 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.890
 hours and as a person this I think yes no 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.240
 good but I think it's something normal is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.720
 something normal 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.780
 I know that many people and I steal or you 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.530
 character in your character you have some 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 some ritual or something like that you do 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.069
 before getting into the ring looks good 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.520
 Although my character 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.550
 nervous 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.700
 and it has a lot to do with aluminum 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.700
 today 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.069
 the only thing I do before going up 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.290
 ring entrust me to God and ask him to 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.299
 that my work my health my person 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.069
 always be also imagine with life 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.069
 but bye bye 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.849
 an advice that you could give to 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.829
 women whom he aspires to be 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.560
 fighters good to those who wait already 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.840
 those that I do not tell you that always 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.569
 look for and try to achieve your dreams 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.980
 because you can always in those moments 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.560
 the woman we already have a very place 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.870
 important within the struggle within 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.970
 all jobs we already have women 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.909
 in society I think everything 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.010
 the woman is important if she is seeing 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.299
 that every day more and more and more we are the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.120
 family support 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.799
 then I do tell them to fight so 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.590
 What else do they always look for? 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.450

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.740
 I have not heard more than the members who 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.470

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.860
 that I was running upstairs in the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.130

 trying the mold being heard the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:20.079

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.900
