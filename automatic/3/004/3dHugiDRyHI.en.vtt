00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
not to just swing here I guess I can get

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.999 
not to just swing here I guess I can get
a<00:01:14.100> head<00:01:14.250> start<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.580> tapping<00:01:15.000> things<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.860> if<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
a head start on tapping things down if I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
a head start on tapping things down if I
don't<00:01:19.640> fly<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:21.149> stack

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 

if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> drop's<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> flyer<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
if you drop's this flyer here then I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.850 
if you drop's this flyer here then I
lose<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> turn<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.710> end

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
lose a turn I would have in the end

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.940 
lose a turn I would have in the end
dealt<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.250> damage<00:01:33.440> if<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> flyer

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
dealt more damage if it's not a flyer

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
dealt more damage if it's not a flyer
then<00:01:37.340> doesn't<00:01:38.340> matter<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:41.690> removal<00:01:42.690> would

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
then doesn't matter much removal would

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.920 
then doesn't matter much removal would
kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.410> stink

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.860 

hmm<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.880> maybe<00:01:55.240> he's<00:01:55.420> thinking<00:01:55.600> about

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
hmm I think maybe he's thinking about

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.420 
hmm I think maybe he's thinking about
dropping<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.230> creature<00:01:56.440> into<00:01:56.710> our<00:01:56.950> anatomist

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
dropping a creature into our anatomist

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.790 
dropping a creature into our anatomist
or<00:01:58.120> whether<00:01:58.690> he<00:01:58.840> should<00:01:58.900> wait<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.200> an<00:01:59.620> answer

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
or whether he should wait for an answer

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.450 
or whether he should wait for an answer
to<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> anatomist<00:02:00.660> tangling<00:02:01.660> okay<00:02:02.340> takes<00:02:03.340> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
to the anatomist tangling okay takes a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.790 
to the anatomist tangling okay takes a
while<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.730> whittle<00:02:04.030> down<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.660> think<00:02:04.800> his

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
while to whittle down so I think his

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:16.140 
while to whittle down so I think his
plan<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.720> try<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:12.060> grind<00:02:13.060> us<00:02:15.150> here

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
plan is to is to try and grind us here

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
plan is to is to try and grind us here
here<00:02:16.420> we've<00:02:16.570> an<00:02:16.930> interesting<00:02:17.440> question<00:02:17.890> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
here we've an interesting question on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.850 
here we've an interesting question on
whether<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:19.900> we're<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> drop<00:02:20.800> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
whether or not we're going to drop a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.180 
whether or not we're going to drop a
border<00:02:21.280> pot<00:02:21.459> here<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.530> able<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.800> deal<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
border pot here to be able to deal to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.229 
border pot here to be able to deal to
damage<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.820> them<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.350> think<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.489> think

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
damage to them I think so but I think

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.760 
damage to them I think so but I think
actually<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.540> real<00:02:28.690> question<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.470> drop

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
actually the real question is do we drop

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
actually the real question is do we drop
mortar<00:02:30.130> pod<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.550> go<00:02:31.209> talk<00:02:31.450> no<00:02:31.600> because<00:02:31.810> then

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
mortar pod and go talk no because then

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 
mortar pod and go talk no because then
we<00:02:31.989> can<00:02:32.110> tap<00:02:32.350> down<00:02:32.590> his<00:02:32.770> thing<00:02:33.100> okay<00:02:33.400> I'm<00:02:33.610> just

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
we can tap down his thing okay I'm just

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.850 
we can tap down his thing okay I'm just
dropping<00:02:33.970> water<00:02:34.239> pot<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:40.650> definitely<00:02:41.650> wanna

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
dropping water pot I definitely wanna

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.320 
dropping water pot I definitely wanna
drop<00:02:41.980> motor<00:02:42.220> part<00:02:42.370> because<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.030> definitely

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
drop motor part because I I definitely

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.490 
drop motor part because I I definitely
ought<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> play<00:02:43.660> with<00:02:43.780> pickle<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.080> talk<00:02:44.260> next

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
ought to play with pickle and talk next

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.210 
ought to play with pickle and talk next
turn<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.670> also<00:02:45.820> lets<00:02:46.270> me<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:47.220> painted

reach road although going to his face

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.590 
reach road although going to his face
would<00:02:49.810> be<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.290> fine<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:50.620> well<00:02:50.739> that

on<00:03:43.639> our<00:03:43.730> flyer<00:03:43.969> I<00:03:44.000> don't<00:03:44.299> think<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.599> will

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.800 

I<00:04:00.830> think<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.030> think<00:04:02.270> what<00:04:02.360> we<00:04:02.450> want<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.660> do<00:04:02.780> here

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
I think I think what we want to do here

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:11.650 
I think I think what we want to do here
is<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:06.250> glint<00:04:07.250> hawk<00:04:10.120> make<00:04:11.120> sure<00:04:11.300> I<00:04:11.330> go<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
is a glint hawk make sure I go to the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.020 
is a glint hawk make sure I go to the
face<00:04:11.900> here

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.000 

and<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.209> lets<00:04:20.540> me<00:04:20.630> have<00:04:21.109> an<00:04:21.260> animist<00:04:21.650> open

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.730 

because<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.669> way<00:04:27.820> he<00:04:28.270> if<00:04:28.480> he<00:04:28.600> he<00:04:29.320> taps<00:04:29.530> down

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
because that way he if he he taps down

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.400 
because that way he if he he taps down
or<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:29.949> animist<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.900> get<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.110> put<00:04:32.230> another

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
or an animist here we get to put another

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.140 
or an animist here we get to put another
minus<00:04:32.740> one<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:32.949> then<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.550> only<00:04:33.669> one<00:04:33.940> power

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
minus one and then it's only one power

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.210 
minus one and then it's only one power
tangle<00:04:34.570> angler<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.110> that's<00:04:35.680> not<00:04:35.949> gonna<00:04:36.070> do

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.689 
tangle angler so that's not gonna do
that<00:04:36.550> much<00:04:37.000> good<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.680> he<00:04:38.800> looks<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.550> he's

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
that much good so he looks like he's

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.439 
that much good so he looks like he's
saving<00:04:40.000> his<00:04:40.120> humble<00:04:40.600> magnet<00:04:40.870> for<00:04:41.110> another<00:04:41.290> day
