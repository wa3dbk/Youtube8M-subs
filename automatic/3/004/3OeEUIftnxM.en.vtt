Woodford<00:01:45.830> design<00:01:46.250> we've<00:01:46.880> been<00:01:47.000> making<00:01:47.150> cables

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
Woodford design we've been making cables

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.330 
Woodford design we've been making cables
for<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.840> number<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.140> years<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.590> we<00:01:49.010> wanted<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
for a number of years now we wanted to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.220 
for a number of years now we wanted to
take<00:01:49.580> our<00:01:49.760> cables<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.360> next<00:01:50.630> level<00:01:50.930> and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
take our cables to the next level and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.720 
take our cables to the next level and
produce<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.620> really<00:01:51.920> high<00:01:52.100> quality<00:01:52.160> and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
produce a really high quality and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.630 
produce a really high quality and
high-class<00:01:53.120> cable<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:54.320> not<00:01:54.500> only<00:01:54.650> was<00:01:54.980> fully

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
high-class cable that not only was fully

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.120 
high-class cable that not only was fully
MFI<00:01:56.090> certified<00:01:56.690> by<00:01:56.870> Apple<00:01:57.230> but<00:01:57.680> also<00:01:57.860> had<00:01:58.100> a

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
MFI certified by Apple but also had a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.430 
MFI certified by Apple but also had a
lifetime<00:01:58.580> guarantee<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.330> was<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.290> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
lifetime guarantee and was of the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.070 
lifetime guarantee and was of the
highest<00:02:00.740> quality<00:02:01.370> that<00:02:01.400> we<00:02:01.730> could<00:02:01.880> make<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
highest quality that we could make and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.020 
highest quality that we could make and
what<00:02:03.260> we've<00:02:03.410> done<00:02:03.620> is<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.220> started<00:02:04.670> off<00:02:04.820> with

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
what we've done is we started off with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.960 
what we've done is we started off with
an<00:02:05.180> apple<00:02:05.510> certified<00:02:06.200> cable<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.610> means

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
an apple certified cable so that means

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.580 
an apple certified cable so that means
it<00:02:08.179> will<00:02:08.270> carry<00:02:08.570> our<00:02:08.720> working<00:02:09.200> even<00:02:09.440> when

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
it will carry our working even when

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.040 
it will carry our working even when
Apple<00:02:10.040> do<00:02:10.160> iOS<00:02:10.610> update<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:11.690> we've<00:02:11.840> made

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
Apple do iOS update and then we've made

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.699 
Apple do iOS update and then we've made
the<00:02:12.200> plugs<00:02:12.470> super<00:02:13.310> strong<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.990> cable<00:02:15.500> or

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the plugs super strong so the cable or

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.680 
the plugs super strong so the cable or
the<00:02:15.980> chips<00:02:16.220> aside<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> connector<00:02:17.240> they're

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the chips aside the connector they're

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.720 
the chips aside the connector they're
all<00:02:17.840> molded<00:02:18.260> together<00:02:18.560> first<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
all molded together first and then the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.570 
all molded together first and then the
aluminum<00:02:19.880> outside<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.810> placed<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> then

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
aluminum outside is placed on and then

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.370 
aluminum outside is placed on and then
what<00:02:22.730> we've<00:02:22.880> done<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.240> we've<00:02:23.420> also<00:02:23.660> added<00:02:23.959> some

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
what we've done is we've also added some

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.160 
what we've done is we've also added some
really<00:02:24.560> good<00:02:24.890> laser<00:02:25.580> graphics<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> cable

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
really good laser graphics so the cable

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.949 
really good laser graphics so the cable
looks<00:02:27.350> great<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.250> got<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.430> woven<00:02:29.000> sheath<00:02:29.720> on

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
looks great it's got a woven sheath on

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.690 
looks great it's got a woven sheath on
the<00:02:30.080> outside<00:02:30.500> which<00:02:30.950> means<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.520> won't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the outside which means that it won't

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.970 
the outside which means that it won't
get<00:02:31.820> tangled<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.300> easily<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> also<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.650> also<00:02:33.950> a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
get tangled up easily and also is also a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.010 
get tangled up easily and also is also a
lot<00:02:34.160> tougher<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.450> we've<00:02:35.600> added<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
lot tougher and then we've added a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.260 
lot tougher and then we've added a
really<00:02:36.170> super<00:02:36.680> simple<00:02:37.010> Cape<00:02:37.250> tiny<00:02:37.640> there's<00:02:38.209> a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
really super simple Cape tiny there's a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.030 
really super simple Cape tiny there's a
little<00:02:38.510> magnetic<00:02:38.840> device<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.769> stops

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
little magnetic device that just stops

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
little magnetic device that just stops
that<00:02:40.220> annoying<00:02:40.550> habit<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.570> cables<00:02:42.019> falling

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
that annoying habit of cables falling

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.990 
that annoying habit of cables falling
down<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.709> back<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.160> sideboard<00:02:43.640> or<00:02:43.820> your

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
we've also got some really good stretch

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.740 
we've also got some really good stretch
goals<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.159> initially<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.090> quick-draw<00:02:50.299> just

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
goals so initially the quick-draw just

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.539 
goals so initially the quick-draw just
come<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:50.989> silver<00:02:51.379> but<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.099> hit<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.310> first

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
come in silver but if we hit the first

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.460 
come in silver but if we hit the first
goal<00:02:52.790> there<00:02:53.030> will<00:02:53.150> also<00:02:53.480> produce<00:02:53.629> in<00:02:54.049> gold<00:02:54.080> in

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
goal there will also produce in gold in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.440 
goal there will also produce in gold in
space<00:02:54.709> grey<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.790> matches<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.239> back

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
space grey so that it matches the back

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.839 
space grey so that it matches the back
of<00:02:56.629> your<00:02:56.750> iPhone<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.140> iPad<00:02:57.620> pro<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.519> move<00:02:58.730> on

to<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.030> next<00:02:59.269> goal<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.870> where<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.140> gets

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to the next goal this is where it gets

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.960 
to the next goal this is where it gets
really<00:03:00.530> interesting<00:03:00.730> we're<00:03:01.730> going<00:03:01.879> to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
really interesting we're going to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.819 
really interesting we're going to
incorporate<00:03:02.569> an<00:03:02.750> indicator<00:03:03.200> lamp<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.709> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
charged or not so the animal will read

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.699 
charged or not so the animal will read
when<00:03:11.390> it's<00:03:11.420> charging<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:12.379> it'll<00:03:12.500> turn

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
when it's charging and then it'll turn

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.649 
when it's charging and then it'll turn
to<00:03:12.860> green<00:03:13.159> when<00:03:13.730> your<00:03:13.879> iPhone<00:03:14.269> is<00:03:14.450> fully

to green when your iPhone is fully

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.350 
to green when your iPhone is fully
charged<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.340> last<00:03:16.489> few<00:03:16.700> years<00:03:16.849> report<00:03:17.299> a
