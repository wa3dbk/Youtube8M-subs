a question in the comments section below

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040 
a question in the comments section below
and<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.460> answer<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.359> question<00:00:18.900> today

and I answer it first question today

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.070 
and I answer it first question today
comes<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.680> us<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:19.830> NASA<00:00:20.420> 99<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.689> there<00:00:21.960> any

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
comes to us from NASA 99 is there any

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
comes to us from NASA 99 is there any
chance<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.740> battlefield<00:00:23.100> 5<00:00:23.550> will<00:00:23.760> come

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
chance that a battlefield 5 will come

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.130 
chance that a battlefield 5 will come
out<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> new<00:00:24.510> graphics<00:00:24.990> engine

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
out with the new graphics engine

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
out with the new graphics engine
possibly<00:00:25.529> frostbite<00:00:26.430> greetings<00:00:27.210> from

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
possibly frostbite greetings from

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.230 
possibly frostbite greetings from
Argentina<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.130> thought<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.670> honestly

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Argentina so my thought on this honestly

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
Argentina so my thought on this honestly
is<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.080> they're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:31.769> with

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
is that I think they're going to go with

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
is that I think they're going to go with
a<00:00:31.980> new<00:00:32.219> engine<00:00:32.520> battlefield<00:00:33.239> 5<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.660> being

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
a new engine battlefield 5 is being

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
a new engine battlefield 5 is being
rumored<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.440> coming<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.210> 2018<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.510> fact

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
rumored to be coming out in 2018 in fact

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
rumored to be coming out in 2018 in fact
it's<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.260> pre-production<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.730> if

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it's in pre-production right now so if

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's in pre-production right now so if
you<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.660> battlefield<00:00:39.930> 5<00:00:40.260> video<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.370> arm

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you see my battlefield 5 video the arm

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
you see my battlefield 5 video the arm
again<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.140> know<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.950> game<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
again one you will know that the game is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
again one you will know that the game is
in<00:00:44.610> pre-production<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.289> quite

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
in pre-production so if we don't quite

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350 
in pre-production so if we don't quite
know<00:00:46.620> engine<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.910> lon<00:00:48.149> are

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
know engine it's going to be lon are

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
know engine it's going to be lon are
they<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.710> frostbite<00:00:50.280> for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
they going to make the frostbite for

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
they going to make the frostbite for
engine<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.649> just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
engine are they going to you know just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
engine are they going to you know just
completely<00:00:53.370> ditch<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:54.449> over<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
completely ditch it and start over the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
completely ditch it and start over the
reason<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.590> might<00:00:55.829> start<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.699> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
reason they might start over is because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
reason they might start over is because
of<00:00:57.239> battlefield<00:00:58.199> 4<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> people

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of battlefield 4 now a lot of people

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
of battlefield 4 now a lot of people
have<00:00:59.850> been<00:00:59.879> blaming<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.690> netcode<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
have been blaming the netcode on you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
have been blaming the netcode on you
know<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> rubber<00:01:02.370> banding<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:02.969> everything

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
know the rubber banding and everything

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
know the rubber banding and everything
but<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.960> theory<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.860> online

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
but the other theory going around online

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
but the other theory going around online
and<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> general<00:01:07.229> community<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and just in the general community is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.730 
and just in the general community is
that<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.689> engine<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.170> itself

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that it could be the engine that itself

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
that it could be the engine that itself
causing<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> problems<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
causing the problems and that is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
causing the problems and that is
actually<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.590> viable<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.479> actually

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
actually very viable that was actually

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
actually very viable that was actually
one<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.110> theories<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
one of my theories that you know the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
one of my theories that you know the
graphics<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.390> being<00:01:18.750> pushed<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.290> hard<00:01:19.320> on

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
graphics are being pushed so hard on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
graphics are being pushed so hard on
this<00:01:20.009> outdated<00:01:20.490> engine<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:22.080> plays<00:01:22.350> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this outdated engine that now plays are

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
this outdated engine that now plays are
starting<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> repercussions<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
starting to see the repercussions of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780 
starting to see the repercussions of
that<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.890> interesting<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.640> see

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that so it will be interesting to see

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
that so it will be interesting to see
what<00:01:27.090> engine<00:01:27.630> runs<00:01:27.930> battlefield<00:01:28.590> 5<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
what engine runs battlefield 5 and the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
what engine runs battlefield 5 and the
next<00:01:29.790> question<00:01:29.970> comes<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.600> us<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:30.810> Lawrence
