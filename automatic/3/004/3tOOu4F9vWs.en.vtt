00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.420
 The design of a rental home is often 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.039
 to take or leave 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.599
 the house is not yours and you can 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.460
 so no more of your will 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.570
 but you can with the little they 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 home to your own taste really 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
 Now take this carpet was like except 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.840
 contemporary 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.120
 but it is also glued in between 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.070
 removing is not an option here but me 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.230
 lay a laminate on top 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.760
 because it is a low pile carpet and one 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.470
 ideal underwear for 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.910
 Floating goes where long that we it 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.280
 long-legged then fall of course 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.559
 does not succeed in which division will be too much 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.309
 are in the panels and the connection 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.309
 would like to write 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 You can safely abbreviate with one 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 jigsaw or a hand saw that is required 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.170
 not so precise because the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.409
 hide the sawn-off side with a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.409
 Plymouth 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.690
 voila the first row that is lighter and now 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.210
 the rest just to the will way 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.820
 continue working with the tooth in the group 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 from the previous row and good tip is still on 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
 saving in advance is measuring such 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.220
 that you don't start with a full board 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.020
 and then should end with one 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.020
 narrow strip is someone that pulls to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.680
 that is part of the first row to 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.620
 the beginning to the next row does not 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.590
 I actually have no loss that way 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.700
 and I got a what one must have connection 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.600
 and that is still the best 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.440
 result you can use the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 stroke 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
 or click your board to board together 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.630
 in rows 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.420
 or click a full row first 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.070
 with the short sides together around one 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.140
 fully ripe planks 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.140
 you are best to help with the previous question 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 How you do this when placing laminate 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.970
 is to remove different panels from the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.300
 different suits together 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.899
 use that way from any 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.899
 color differences 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.190
 this space becomes a desk to and from 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.510
 high gloss laminate flooring for one 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 special look will provide 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.190
 because it is laminate on a wash carpet 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.190
 lightly we have to shorten the door frames 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.159
 the long after it is there but without 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.689
 points are of course not finished 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.329
 so all spacers can 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.950
 be removed so that the prints 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.900
 the expansion joints 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.060
 nicely against we take the skirting 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.099
 but the transition profile in the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.099
 we anchor the door opening with plugs
