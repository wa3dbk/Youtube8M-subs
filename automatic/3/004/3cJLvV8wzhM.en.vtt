00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
left lead we're going to go sideways

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080 
left lead we're going to go sideways
completely<00:00:57.950> sideways<00:00:58.160> not<00:00:58.610> forward<00:00:59.000> and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
completely sideways not forward and

to<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.990> right<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:05.059> planner<00:01:05.390> right<00:01:06.170> now<00:01:06.650> the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
to the right the planner right now the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.290 
to the right the planner right now the
first<00:01:06.980> time<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.220> might<00:01:07.310> not<00:01:07.460> happen<00:01:07.640> yeah<00:01:08.000> and

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
first time it might not happen yeah and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.510 
first time it might not happen yeah and
whatever<00:01:08.990> happens<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:09.590> allow<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:09.980> to<00:01:10.100> go<00:01:10.310> for

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
whatever happens just allow it to go for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.460 
whatever happens just allow it to go for
a<00:01:10.550> little<00:01:10.640> bit<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.090> then<00:01:11.240> slowly<00:01:11.990> bring<00:01:12.320> it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
a little bit and then slowly bring it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.780 
a little bit and then slowly bring it
down<00:01:12.530> we<00:01:12.980> don't<00:01:13.130> want<00:01:13.370> her<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.610> feel

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
down we don't want her to feel

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.090 
down we don't want her to feel
consequences<00:01:14.690> or<00:01:14.900> feel<00:01:15.140> wrong<00:01:15.410> because<00:01:15.890> it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
consequences or feel wrong because it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.590 
consequences or feel wrong because it
didn't<00:01:16.310> work<00:01:16.460> because<00:01:17.000> at<00:01:17.120> first<00:01:17.270> she's<00:01:17.450> going

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
didn't work because at first she's going

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.000 
didn't work because at first she's going
to<00:01:17.660> go<00:01:17.750> huh<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.200> don't<00:01:18.350> really<00:01:18.620> know<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:18.890> this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
to go huh I don't really know what this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.950 
to go huh I don't really know what this
is<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:19.940> pretty<00:01:20.180> certain<00:01:20.600> she'll<00:01:20.780> see<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
is but pretty certain she'll see the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.070 
is but pretty certain she'll see the
pattern<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.910> it's<00:01:23.270> gonna<00:01:23.450> that's<00:01:23.660> going<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.960> be

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
pattern so it's gonna that's going to be

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.110 
pattern so it's gonna that's going to be
her<00:01:24.200> preparation<00:01:24.800> now<00:01:25.580> what<00:01:25.820> you're<00:01:25.970> also

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
her preparation now what you're also

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.480 
her preparation now what you're also
going<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.420> notice<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.080> how<00:01:27.530> sticky<00:01:28.340> that

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
going to notice is how sticky that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.240 
going to notice is how sticky that
sideways<00:01:29.480> is<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:29.900> way<00:01:30.080> or<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.920> way<00:01:30.980> and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
sideways is this way or that way and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.530 
sideways is this way or that way and
it's<00:01:31.670> going<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> really<00:01:32.060> improve<00:01:32.240> your

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
it's going to really improve your

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
it's going to really improve your
sideways<00:01:33.080> okay<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.400> next<00:01:34.610> thing<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:34.909> does<00:01:35.090> is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
sideways okay the next thing it does is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.510 
sideways okay the next thing it does is
when<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.690> go<00:01:35.810> sideways<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.650> compresses<00:01:37.310> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
when you go sideways it compresses the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.880 
when you go sideways it compresses the
horse's<00:01:37.820> body<00:01:38.020> they<00:01:39.020> get<00:01:39.200> more<00:01:39.440> suspension

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
horse's body they get more suspension

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.740 
horse's body they get more suspension
they<00:01:40.220> come<00:01:40.430> up<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.700> their<00:01:40.880> back<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.300> hind<00:01:41.510> leg

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
they come up in their back the hind leg

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.450 
they come up in their back the hind leg
to<00:01:41.960> get<00:01:42.230> more<00:01:42.440> under<00:01:42.770> them<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.130> now<00:01:43.280> they

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
to get more under them so now they

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.910 
to get more under them so now they
physically<00:01:43.970> prepare<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.540> as<00:01:44.659> well<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.080> then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
physically prepare for as well and then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.610 
physically prepare for as well and then
