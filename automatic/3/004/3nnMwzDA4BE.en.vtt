the<00:02:48.909> green<00:02:49.090> six<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.599> one<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> table

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.410 

he<00:02:54.829> needed<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.219> bit<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.579> right-hand<00:02:55.849> spin

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
he needed a bit of that right-hand spin

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.759 
he needed a bit of that right-hand spin
didn't<00:02:56.749> he<00:02:57.249> just<00:02:58.249> to<00:02:58.370> speed<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.849> qubit<00:02:59.269> up

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
didn't he just to speed that qubit up

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.690 
didn't he just to speed that qubit up
but<00:03:00.769> his<00:03:00.889> left<00:03:01.299> told<00:03:02.299> us<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:03.129> difficult<00:03:04.129> shot

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
but his left told us the difficult shot

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.539 
but his left told us the difficult shot
back<00:03:04.999> up<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.389> table<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.049> if<00:03:07.040> he<00:03:07.129> does<00:03:07.340> then

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
back up the table and if he does then

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.429 
back up the table and if he does then
play<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.939> shot<00:03:08.150> back<00:03:08.269> at<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.599> table<00:03:08.810> very

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
play the shot back at the table very

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.899 
play the shot back at the table very
little<00:03:09.799> chance<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.159> playing<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.489> snooker

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
little chance of playing the snooker

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.339 
little chance of playing the snooker
then<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.209> 1/9<00:03:11.569> combination<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.319> a

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
then the 1/9 combination is a

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.270 
then the 1/9 combination is a
possibility<00:03:14.349> and<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.620> think<00:03:15.829> that's<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
possibility and I think that's the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.759 
possibility and I think that's the
reason<00:03:16.719> that<00:03:17.719> he<00:03:17.870> hasn't<00:03:18.019> got<00:03:18.349> down<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
reason that he hasn't got down and

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.559 
reason that he hasn't got down and
played<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.099> shot<00:03:19.340> right<00:03:19.549> away<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:20.269> putting

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.770 
played the shot right away be putting
all<00:03:20.719> his<00:03:20.840> eggs<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.230> one<00:03:21.379> basket<00:03:21.439> so<00:03:22.659> perhaps<00:03:23.659> he

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
all his eggs in one basket so perhaps he

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.119 
all his eggs in one basket so perhaps he
has<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.049> dump<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.439> one<00:03:24.620> ball<00:03:24.859> on<00:03:24.889> the
