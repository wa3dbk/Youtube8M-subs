00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
not seeing them in anything before but

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.009 
not seeing them in anything before but
judging<00:03:01.430> by<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.670> trailer<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.360> their<00:03:02.750> sort<00:03:02.959> of

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
judging by the trailer and their sort of

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.289 
judging by the trailer and their sort of
sinister<00:03:03.380> creepy<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:04.610> kind<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.000> cute

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
sinister creepy but kind of cute

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.420 
sinister creepy but kind of cute
performance<00:03:05.629> it's<00:03:06.079> gonna<00:03:06.170> be<00:03:06.349> one<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.220> watch

just be another movie to add to their
collection<00:03:26.420> but<00:03:27.200> I'm<00:03:27.590> excited<00:03:28.069> about<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.639> it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
collection but I'm excited about it it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.890 
collection but I'm excited about it it
looks<00:03:28.880> kind<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.510> creepy<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:31.359> I'm<00:03:32.359> personally

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
looks kind of creepy and I'm personally

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.120 
looks kind of creepy and I'm personally
scared<00:03:33.109> by<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.530> trailer

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:56.490 

I<00:03:53.640> think<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.090> trailer<00:03:55.660> they<00:03:56.230> probably

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
I think in the trailer they probably

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.100 
I think in the trailer they probably
gave<00:03:56.740> a<00:03:56.800> little<00:03:57.280> bit<00:03:57.460> too<00:03:57.760> much<00:03:58.000> away<00:03:58.270> I<00:03:58.690> think

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
gave a little bit too much away I think

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.080 
gave a little bit too much away I think
they<00:03:59.290> probably<00:03:59.560> could<00:03:59.860> have<00:03:59.950> held<00:04:00.580> back<00:04:00.850> on

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
they probably could have held back on

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.420 
they probably could have held back on
giving<00:04:01.390> away<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.750> actual<00:04:01.900> figure<00:04:02.710> so<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.220> kind

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
giving away the actual figure so it kind

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.030 
giving away the actual figure so it kind
of<00:04:03.490> looks<00:04:03.640> like<00:04:03.790> an<00:04:04.060> almost<00:04:04.390> CGI'd<00:04:05.200> creepy<00:04:05.890> old

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
of looks like an almost CGI'd creepy old

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.360 
of looks like an almost CGI'd creepy old
lady<00:04:06.360> who<00:04:07.360> does<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.630> strange<00:04:08.230> crab<00:04:08.650> walk<00:04:08.890> I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
lady who does a strange crab walk I

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.710 
lady who does a strange crab walk I
think<00:04:09.700> if<00:04:09.910> they<00:04:10.030> had<00:04:10.120> left<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.420> out<00:04:10.600> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
think if they had left that out the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.020 
think if they had left that out the
trailer<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.350> think<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.740> would<00:04:11.830> have<00:04:11.920> given<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.790> a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
trailer I think it would have given it a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.270 
trailer I think it would have given it a
little<00:04:13.600> more<00:04:13.840> edge<00:04:14.140> but<00:04:14.800> there<00:04:14.890> are<00:04:14.980> some<00:04:15.100> nice

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
little more edge but there are some nice

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.620 
little more edge but there are some nice
little<00:04:15.490> shots<00:04:15.820> no<00:04:16.000> they're<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.299> hint<00:04:16.510> of

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
little shots no they're just hint of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.940 
little shots no they're just hint of
little<00:04:16.870> things<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.200> come<00:04:17.380> there's<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.620> moment

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
little things to come there's a moment

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.410 
little things to come there's a moment
where<00:04:18.070> one<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.459> girls<00:04:18.730> opens<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.239> door

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
where one of the girls opens the door

movies<00:05:41.440> that<00:05:41.890> come<00:05:42.070> out<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.610> probably<00:05:42.880> don't

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
movies that come out and probably don't

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.970

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
deliver on that and I think seeing it in

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.400 
deliver on that and I think seeing it in
the<00:05:45.130> big<00:05:45.340> screen<00:05:45.730> with<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:47.050> surround

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
the big screen with the the surround

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.230 
the big screen with the the surround
sound<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:48.220> possibly<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.580> few<00:05:48.790> sort<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.090> people

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
sound and possibly a few sort of people

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.430 
sound and possibly a few sort of people
scattered<00:05:49.690> around<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.900> theater<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.410> think

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
scattered around the theater I think

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.440 
scattered around the theater I think
it'll<00:05:50.710> give<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:51.010> nice<00:05:51.100> creepy<00:05:51.670> vibe<00:05:51.910> so<00:05:52.390> if

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
it'll give it a nice creepy vibe so if

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.610 
it'll give it a nice creepy vibe so if
you<00:05:52.570> want<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.780> trailer<00:05:53.080> make<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:53.320> want<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.500> go

the<00:05:53.740> cinema<00:05:53.890> pay<00:05:54.550> towards<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:54.970> film<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.390> think

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
the cinema pay towards the film I think

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.190 
the cinema pay towards the film I think
so<00:05:56.550> before<00:05:57.550> doing<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.910> show<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.420> hadn't<00:05:59.020> even

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
so before doing the show I hadn't even

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.990 
so before doing the show I hadn't even
heard<00:05:59.590> of<00:05:59.830> it<00:06:00.010> but<00:06:00.280> after<00:06:00.580> looking<00:06:00.700> at<00:06:00.880> the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
heard of it but after looking at the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.960 
heard of it but after looking at the
trailer<00:06:01.420> I'm<00:06:01.930> definitely<00:06:02.470> intrigued<00:06:02.920> if<00:06:03.340> it

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
trailer I'm definitely intrigued if it

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.850 
trailer I'm definitely intrigued if it
didn't<00:06:04.210> have<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.510> del<00:06:04.840> Toro<00:06:05.170> moniker

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
didn't have the del Toro moniker

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.440 
didn't have the del Toro moniker
attached<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.490> it<00:06:06.610> do<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.790> reckon<00:06:07.060> you'd<00:06:07.180> still

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
attached to it do you reckon you'd still

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.780 
attached to it do you reckon you'd still
go<00:06:07.630> and<00:06:07.750> sit<00:06:07.930> judging<00:06:08.290> by<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.470> trailer<00:06:08.770> yeah<00:06:09.760> I
