00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.880 

the<00:00:05.840> four<00:00:06.050> strokes<00:00:06.410> that<00:00:06.620> we're<00:00:06.740> going<00:00:06.830> to

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
the four strokes that we're going to

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.660 
the four strokes that we're going to
learn<00:00:07.069> today<00:00:07.550> is<00:00:08.139> going<00:00:09.139> to<00:00:09.260> be<00:00:09.610> integral<00:00:10.610> to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
learn today is going to be integral to

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.629 
learn today is going to be integral to
us<00:00:11.240> executing<00:00:12.139> some<00:00:12.740> of<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.980> rudiments<00:00:13.280> that

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
us executing some of the rudiments that

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.400 
us executing some of the rudiments that
we're<00:00:13.760> going<00:00:13.879> to<00:00:13.940> go<00:00:14.090> over<00:00:14.389> a<00:00:14.420> little<00:00:14.719> down<00:00:15.230> the

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
we're going to go over a little down the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.100 
we're going to go over a little down the
road<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:16.550> first<00:00:16.820> stroke<00:00:17.240> is<00:00:17.449> actually<00:00:17.990> the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
road the first stroke is actually the

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.689 
road the first stroke is actually the
easiest<00:00:18.470> stroke<00:00:18.800> of<00:00:18.949> them<00:00:19.100> all<00:00:19.279> because<00:00:19.580> we're

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
easiest stroke of them all because we're

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.400 
easiest stroke of them all because we're
going<00:00:19.789> to<00:00:19.850> let<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.119> stick<00:00:20.359> do<00:00:20.510> all<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.930> work<00:00:21.110> I

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
going to let the stick do all the work I

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.310 
going to let the stick do all the work I
like<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:22.370> okay<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:22.760> it's<00:00:23.540> called<00:00:23.870> the<00:00:24.050> full

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
like that okay so it's called the full

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.920 
like that okay so it's called the full
stroke<00:00:24.650> or<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:24.920> rebound<00:00:25.430> stroke<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:25.970> we're

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
stroke or the rebound stroke and we're

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.450 
stroke or the rebound stroke and we're
going<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.140> start<00:00:27.500> back<00:00:27.710> here<00:00:28.130> we're<00:00:28.310> going<00:00:28.400> to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
going to start back here we're going to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.270 
going to start back here we're going to
wind<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:29.210> baby<00:00:29.480> up<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:29.930> we're<00:00:30.710> going<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:30.890> let

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
wind this baby up and we're going to let

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.860 
wind this baby up and we're going to let
the<00:00:31.460> stick<00:00:31.760> kind<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.270> like<00:00:32.390> dribbling<00:00:32.629> a

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
the stick kind of like dribbling a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.180 
the stick kind of like dribbling a
basketball<00:00:33.020> if<00:00:33.410> you've<00:00:33.559> ever<00:00:33.710> dribbled<00:00:34.160> the

basketball if you've ever dribbled the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.740 
basketball if you've ever dribbled the
basketball<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:34.820> know<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.059> bow<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.570> ball

basketball you know the bow the ball

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.410 
basketball you know the bow the ball
bounces<00:00:36.289> right<00:00:36.320> back<00:00:36.500> up<00:00:37.120> we're<00:00:38.120> going<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.300> let

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
bounces right back up we're going to let

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.090 
bounces right back up we're going to let
the<00:00:38.540> stick<00:00:38.780> bounce<00:00:39.020> right<00:00:39.350> back<00:00:39.410> up<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.920> the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
the stick bounce right back up to the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.490 
the stick bounce right back up to the
starting<00:00:40.579> position<00:00:40.810> so<00:00:41.810> we're<00:00:42.050> going<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.200> snap

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
starting position so we're going to snap

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.300 
starting position so we're going to snap
the<00:00:42.680> stick<00:00:42.920> down<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.430> it'll<00:00:43.579> sound<00:00:43.700> like<00:00:43.850> this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310

and loose this is primarily a wrist
wrist<00:01:37.390> stroke<00:01:37.750> as<00:01:37.900> you<00:01:38.020> can<00:01:38.200> see<00:01:38.440> I'm<00:01:38.560> just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
wrist stroke as you can see I'm just

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.540 
wrist stroke as you can see I'm just
using<00:01:38.830> my<00:01:39.160> wrist

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
using my wrist

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.010 
using my wrist
the<00:01:39.910> next<00:01:40.180> exercise<00:01:40.420> that's<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:40.900> your

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
the next exercise that's in your

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.050 
the next exercise that's in your
workbook<00:01:41.140> there<00:01:41.560> we're<00:01:42.430> going<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.610> use<00:01:42.850> both

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
workbook there we're going to use both

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.000 
workbook there we're going to use both
hands<00:01:43.600> we're<00:01:44.200> going<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.380> let<00:01:44.590> them<00:01:44.740> work

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
hands we're going to let them work

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.560 
hands we're going to let them work
together<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.460> little<00:01:45.760> bit<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:46.150> rather<00:01:46.360> than

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
together a little bit just rather than

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.280 
together a little bit just rather than
eight<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.930> hand

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
eight on a hand

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.810 
eight on a hand
so<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.560> exercise<00:01:47.920> goes<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.490> I'll<00:01:48.700> give

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
so the exercise goes like this I'll give

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:15.150 
so the exercise goes like this I'll give
you<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.060> click<00:01:49.270> here<00:01:49.570> one<00:01:50.110> two<00:01:50.800> three<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.620> this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you the click here one two three so this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.190 
you the click here one two three so this
brings<00:02:15.850> us<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.090> our<00:02:16.239> next<00:02:16.570> stroke<00:02:16.930> which<00:02:17.170> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
brings us to our next stroke which is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
brings us to our next stroke which is
the<00:02:17.739> half<00:02:18.040> stroke<00:02:18.459> or<00:02:18.670> tap<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.040> going

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the half stroke or tap this is not going

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.920 
the half stroke or tap this is not going
to<00:02:21.310> require<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.940> stick<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.300> go<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.540> quite<00:02:22.780> as

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
to require the stick to go up quite as

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.930 
to require the stick to go up quite as
high<00:02:22.959> although<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.190> still<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.489> rebound

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
high although it is still a rebound

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.060 
high although it is still a rebound
stroke<00:02:25.330> we're<00:02:25.810> getting<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> stick<00:02:26.680> off<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
stroke we're getting the stick off the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.190 
stroke we're getting the stick off the
head<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.430> only<00:02:27.730> comes<00:02:28.060> off<00:02:28.209> about<00:02:28.660> off<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
head it only comes off about off the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.350 
head it only comes off about off the
head<00:02:29.380> about<00:02:29.560> three<00:02:30.160> four<00:02:30.610> inches<00:02:30.760> okay<00:02:31.299> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
head about three four inches okay so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
head about three four inches okay so
we're<00:02:31.630> going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> start<00:02:32.080> here<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:38.320> we're

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
we're going to start here and we're

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.410 
we're going to start here and we're
going<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.280> rely<00:02:39.670> heavily<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.180> our

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
going to really rely heavily on our

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.400 
going to really rely heavily on our
fingers<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.519> good<00:02:45.850> exercise

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
fingers for this so a good exercise

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860 
fingers for this so a good exercise
would<00:02:47.410> be<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:48.040> call<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.120> eight<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> finger

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
would be I call it eight on a finger

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.319 
would be I call it eight on a finger
don't<00:02:50.769> look<00:02:50.920> at<00:02:51.070> me<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.310> isolate<00:02:51.940> our<00:02:52.120> our

don't look at me like isolate our our

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.000 
don't look at me like isolate our our
fingers<00:02:53.489> by<00:02:55.170> squeezing<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.380> fulcrum<00:02:56.769> here

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010

finger one two three four five six seven
eight<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.400> feel<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.549> I'm<00:03:15.700> warding<00:03:16.090> off

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
eight I feel like I'm warding off

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.240 
eight I feel like I'm warding off
vampires<00:03:16.480> here<00:03:17.110> or<00:03:17.230> something

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
vampires here or something

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.620 
vampires here or something
and<00:03:18.549> then<00:03:18.640> we're<00:03:18.730> going<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.030> back<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.390> our

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
and then we're going to go back to our

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.420 
and then we're going to go back to our
ring<00:03:20.110> finger<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.560> I'll<00:03:20.709> play<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.070> whole<00:03:21.100> thing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
ring finger so I'll play the whole thing

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.800 
ring finger so I'll play the whole thing
as<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> loop<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.329> see<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.690> I'm<00:03:22.780> doing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
as a loop so you can see what I'm doing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.940 
as a loop so you can see what I'm doing
here

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.880 

I<00:03:28.440> can't<00:03:29.440> cut<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.739> best<00:03:34.349> okay<00:03:35.349> so<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:35.830> really

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
I can't cut the best okay so it's really

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.100 
I can't cut the best okay so it's really
effective<00:03:36.760> because<00:03:36.970> when<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.510> use<00:03:37.540> all<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
effective because when we use all the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.900 
effective because when we use all the
fingers<00:03:38.470> we're<00:03:38.620> going<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.860> be<00:03:38.980> blazing<00:03:39.610> speed

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
fingers we're going to be blazing speed

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.270 
fingers we're going to be blazing speed
and<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.440> even<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.800> know<00:03:44.890> what<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.130> can

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
and you can even you know what you can

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.040 
and you can even you know what you can
use<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.580> same<00:03:45.790> exercise<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.780> gave<00:03:47.019> you

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
use the same exercise that I gave you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.870 
use the same exercise that I gave you
for<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.560> full<00:03:47.739> strokes<00:03:48.069> with<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.370> taps<00:03:48.700> you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
for the full strokes with the taps you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:04:02.370 
for the full strokes with the taps you
can<00:03:49.000> do<00:03:59.459> now<00:04:00.459> how<00:04:00.760> do<00:04:00.819> we<00:04:01.239> get<00:04:01.480> from<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:02.049> full

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
can do now how do we get from a full

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.870 
can do now how do we get from a full
stroke<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> tap<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:04.239> ask<00:04:04.510> good<00:04:05.230> question

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
stroke to a tap you ask good question

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.370 
stroke to a tap you ask good question
this<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:06.940> called<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.329> controlled<00:04:07.750> stroke<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
this is called the controlled stroke and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.920 
this is called the controlled stroke and
we're<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.160> start<00:04:09.489> back<00:04:09.819> here<00:04:09.849> but<00:04:10.780> we're

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
we're going to start back here but we're

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.990 
we're going to start back here but we're
going<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.110> end<00:04:11.349> up<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.130> position<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.670> play

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
going to end up in the position to play

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.569 
going to end up in the position to play
a<00:04:13.090> tap<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:14.019> very<00:04:14.290> effective<00:04:14.650> for<00:04:14.799> accents

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
a tap this is very effective for accents

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.729 
a tap this is very effective for accents
and<00:04:15.730> we<00:04:16.450> need<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.870> spend<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> lot<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.350> time<00:04:17.590> on

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
and we need to spend a lot of time on

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.870 
and we need to spend a lot of time on
this<00:04:17.829> because<00:04:18.010> we're<00:04:18.250> going<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.430> use<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.820> a

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
this because we're going to use this a

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.789 
this because we're going to use this a
lot<00:04:19.090> with<00:04:19.239> accents<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.079> especially<00:04:20.440> around

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
lot with accents and especially around

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.460 
lot with accents and especially around
the<00:04:20.859> drum<00:04:21.070> set<00:04:21.360> so<00:04:22.360> we're<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.200> start

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the drum set so we're going to start

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.600 
the drum set so we're going to start
back<00:04:23.680> here<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.330> end<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.710> here<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:26.979> boom<00:04:27.400> just

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
back here and end up here so boom just

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.610 
back here and end up here so boom just
like<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.750> throw<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.110> down<00:04:29.139> there

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
like that just throw it down there

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
okay now there's no need for tension

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.460 
okay now there's no need for tension
you're<00:04:34.270> just<00:04:34.510> gonna<00:04:34.600> you're<00:04:35.080> just<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.440> to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
fingers to catch the stick where you

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.540 
fingers to catch the stick where you
want<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.370> catch<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.729> okay<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.240> like<00:04:41.169> that<00:04:41.320> I

want to catch it okay just like that I
am<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.690> good<00:04:43.840> exercise<00:04:43.960> would<00:04:44.590> be<00:04:44.650> eighth

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
am and a good exercise would be eighth

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.640 
am and a good exercise would be eighth
note<00:04:45.669> triplets<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.389> if<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:47.050> your<00:04:47.440> eyes<00:04:47.620> are

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
note triplets and if you your eyes are

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.150 
note triplets and if you your eyes are
crossing<00:04:48.190> don't<00:04:48.700> worry<00:04:48.940> it's<00:04:49.210> going<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.660> be

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
crossing don't worry it's going to be

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.379 
crossing don't worry it's going to be
every<00:04:51.160> quarter<00:04:51.580> note<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.240> be<00:04:52.360> a

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
every quarter note is going to be a

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.000 
every quarter note is going to be a
controlled<00:04:52.870> stroke<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.590> we're<00:04:53.830> going<00:04:53.950> to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
controlled stroke and we're going to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:07.940 
controlled stroke and we're going to
alternate<00:04:54.520> hands<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.600> here<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:55.990> goes<00:04:56.020> one<00:04:56.380> two

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.230 

and<00:05:08.950> that's<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.280> good<00:05:09.460> one<00:05:09.610> because<00:05:09.730> it<00:05:10.060> gets

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
and that's a good one because it gets

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000 
and that's a good one because it gets
our<00:05:10.360> controlled<00:05:10.810> strokes<00:05:11.200> working<00:05:11.680> with<00:05:11.830> our

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
our controlled strokes working with our

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.780 
our controlled strokes working with our
taps<00:05:13.290> yeah<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.560> let's<00:05:15.460> try<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:15.670> a<00:05:15.760> little

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
taps yeah so let's try it a little

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:24.930 
taps yeah so let's try it a little
faster<00:05:22.590> ok<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:23.800> when<00:05:23.890> we<00:05:23.980> get<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.130> jazz<00:05:24.490> you're

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
faster ok and when we get to jazz you're

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.400 
faster ok and when we get to jazz you're
gonna<00:05:25.060> be<00:05:25.210> playing<00:05:25.420> that<00:05:25.600> all<00:05:25.750> all<00:05:25.990> day<00:05:26.230> long

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
gonna be playing that all all day long

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.620 
gonna be playing that all all day long

all night long huh

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.430 
all night long huh
ok<00:05:29.080> did<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.740> say<00:05:29.980> that<00:05:30.190> yes<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.670> did<00:05:30.910> ok<00:05:31.440> editing

ok did I say that yes I did ok editing

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.850 
ok did I say that yes I did ok editing
magic<00:05:32.770> alright<00:05:33.760> next<00:05:34.500> stroke<00:05:35.500> we're<00:05:35.680> going<00:05:35.800> to

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
magic alright next stroke we're going to

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.520 
magic alright next stroke we're going to
talk<00:05:36.010> about<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.490> going<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.210> other<00:05:37.240> way<00:05:37.660> which

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
talk about is going the other way which

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.610 
talk about is going the other way which
is<00:05:38.560> getting<00:05:39.040> from<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.310> tap<00:05:39.610> up<00:05:40.020> back<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.290> a<00:05:41.320> full

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
is getting from a tap up back to a full

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.060 
is getting from a tap up back to a full
stroke<00:05:41.890> so<00:05:42.630> we<00:05:43.630> only<00:05:43.810> have<00:05:44.140> enough<00:05:44.530> rebound

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
stroke so we only have enough rebound

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
stroke so we only have enough rebound
from<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.640> tap<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:47.320> get<00:05:47.470> back<00:05:47.740> up<00:05:47.980> here<00:05:48.090> basically

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
from a tap to get back up here basically

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.560 
from a tap to get back up here basically
so<00:05:49.690> we<00:05:50.170> need<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.590> kind<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.950> assist<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.640> hand<00:05:52.030> to

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
so we need to kind of assist the hand to

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.910 
so we need to kind of assist the hand to
get<00:05:52.750> up<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.920> a<00:05:53.950> full<00:05:54.880> stroke<00:05:55.210> here<00:05:55.420> so<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.770> is

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
get up to a full stroke here so this is

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.210 
get up to a full stroke here so this is
called<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.220> upstroke<00:05:58.710> see<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.890> kind<00:06:00.130> of

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
called the upstroke see that kind of

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.340 
called the upstroke see that kind of
slow<00:06:00.490> motion<00:06:00.850> for<00:06:01.000> you<00:06:01.060> that<00:06:01.330> what<00:06:01.750> happens<00:06:02.140> is

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
slow motion for you that what happens is

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.650 
slow motion for you that what happens is
ya<00:06:02.980> upstroke<00:06:03.490> or<00:06:03.640> molar<00:06:03.820> stroke<00:06:04.180> is<00:06:04.360> actually

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
ya upstroke or molar stroke is actually

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.230 
ya upstroke or molar stroke is actually
called<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.680> molar<00:06:05.890> stroke<00:06:06.160> we're<00:06:07.060> going<00:06:07.180> to

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
called the molar stroke we're going to

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.660 
called the molar stroke we're going to
lead<00:06:07.450> with<00:06:07.480> the<00:06:07.810> wrist<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.380> pull<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.370> stick

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
lead with the wrist and pull the stick

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.540 
lead with the wrist and pull the stick
up<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.140> it's<00:06:11.140> going<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.440> be<00:06:11.710> if<00:06:11.980> you've<00:06:12.370> ever

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
up and it's going to be if you've ever

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.680 
up and it's going to be if you've ever
played<00:06:12.760> with<00:06:12.850> a<00:06:13.000> yo-yo<00:06:13.300> I<00:06:13.780> don't<00:06:14.260> know<00:06:14.320> oh<00:06:15.690> it's

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
played with a yo-yo I don't know oh it's

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.380 
played with a yo-yo I don't know oh it's
going<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:16.990> be<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.170> wave<00:06:17.610> action<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.820> we're<00:06:19.240> just

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
going to be a wave action and we're just

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.960 
going to be a wave action and we're just
going<00:06:19.570> to<00:06:19.630> or<00:06:19.900> a<00:06:20.470> whip<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.070> we're<00:06:21.790> going<00:06:21.910> to

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
going to or a whip and we're going to

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.240 
going to or a whip and we're going to
use<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.720> momentum<00:06:22.900> of<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.470> stick<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:24.100> get

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
use the momentum of the stick to get

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.910 
use the momentum of the stick to get
additional<00:06:24.640> balances<00:06:25.210> after<00:06:25.690> we<00:06:26.560> go<00:06:26.680> through

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
additional balances after we go through

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.590 
additional balances after we go through
this<00:06:27.070> but<00:06:27.280> I'm<00:06:27.520> kind<00:06:28.060> of<00:06:28.090> getting<00:06:28.240> ahead<00:06:28.540> of

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
this but I'm kind of getting ahead of

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.910 
this but I'm kind of getting ahead of
myself<00:06:28.780> here<00:06:29.140> but<00:06:29.260> we're<00:06:29.440> just<00:06:29.470> going<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.710> try

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
myself here but we're just going to try

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.860 
myself here but we're just going to try
the<00:06:29.980> Moller<00:06:30.280> stroke<00:06:30.610> again<00:06:30.730> or<00:06:30.970> upstroke<00:06:31.450> you

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
the Moller stroke again or upstroke you

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.550 
the Moller stroke again or upstroke you
start<00:06:32.140> with<00:06:32.290> the<00:06:32.410> tap<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:33.700> risk<00:06:33.940> comes<00:06:34.210> up

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
start with the tap the risk comes up

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.280 
start with the tap the risk comes up
drag<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.770> stick<00:06:36.010> up<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.630> you<00:06:37.630> throw<00:06:37.960> it<00:06:38.020> down

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
drag the stick up and you throw it down

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.940 
drag the stick up and you throw it down
like<00:06:38.590> that<00:06:39.120> so<00:06:40.120> it's<00:06:40.290> yeah<00:06:41.290> it<00:06:41.410> starts<00:06:41.770> at<00:06:41.860> the

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
like that so it's yeah it starts at the

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.600 
like that so it's yeah it starts at the
elbow<00:06:42.450> and<00:06:43.450> you<00:06:43.810> kind<00:06:44.050> of<00:06:44.140> kick<00:06:44.380> your<00:06:44.610> kick
