00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so if you ever damage or claw pillow you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
so if you ever damage or claw pillow you
get<00:01:10.439> stood<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.130> rib<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
get stood on in the rib then you can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
get stood on in the rib then you can
replace<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.079> single<00:01:13.649> part<00:01:14.240> possibly<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
replace that single part possibly the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
replace that single part possibly the
best<00:01:15.840> part<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> mask<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> silicon

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
best part of the mask is the silicon

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.749 
best part of the mask is the silicon
skirt<00:01:18.530> comes<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.649> either<00:01:19.770> clear<00:01:20.219> or<00:01:20.250> dark

silicon<00:01:21.329> most<00:01:21.869> people<00:01:22.140> tend<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
silicon most people tend to go for the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.279 
silicon most people tend to go for the
clear<00:01:22.950> version<00:01:23.189> has<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> double<00:01:24.600> feathered

clear version has a double feathered
silicon<00:01:26.189> inner<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.810> means<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> seal

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
silicon inner that means you get a seal

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.880 
silicon inner that means you get a seal
on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.310> outer<00:01:29.520> edge<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.899> this<00:01:31.049> inner<00:01:31.590> edge

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
on the outer edge and on this inner edge

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
on the outer edge and on this inner edge
as<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> means<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> chance<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
as well and that means the chance of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
as well and that means the chance of
getting<00:01:34.469> water<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.100> mask<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.579> much<00:01:36.149> reduced

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
getting water in the mask a much reduced

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
getting water in the mask a much reduced
it's<00:01:37.289> a<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.799> soft<00:01:38.189> silicone<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> means

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's a very soft silicone that means

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's a very soft silicone that means
that<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.109> you<00:01:40.200> smile<00:01:40.560> underwater<00:01:41.219> or<00:01:41.850> you've

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that if you smile underwater or you've

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
that if you smile underwater or you've
got<00:01:42.270> wrinkles<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.990> maybe<00:01:43.289> you<00:01:43.409> haven't<00:01:43.680> shaved

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
got wrinkles or maybe you haven't shaved

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
got wrinkles or maybe you haven't shaved
then<00:01:44.789> all<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:44.969> those<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:46.140> silicon

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
then all of those things this silicon

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.240 
then all of those things this silicon
will<00:01:46.770> tend<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> compensate<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:49.009> when<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> get

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
will tend to compensate for when you get

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
will tend to compensate for when you get
your<00:01:50.460> Platina<00:01:51.090> mask<00:01:51.359> home<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.719> you've

your Platina mask home and you've

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.950 
your Platina mask home and you've
checked<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> fit<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.070> fine<00:01:53.310> with

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
checked the fit and that's all fine with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
checked the fit and that's all fine with
this<00:01:54.960> particular<00:01:55.259> mask<00:01:55.679> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.460> rub<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this particular mask you can just rub a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
this particular mask you can just rub a
little<00:01:56.850> bit<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> toothpaste<00:01:57.359> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.109> inside
