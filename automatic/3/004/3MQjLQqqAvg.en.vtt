00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
which would be februari 25th 2015

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
which would be februari 25th 2015
shortest<00:01:06.960> likely<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:08.240> 341<00:01:09.240> days<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.810> is

October<00:01:10.470> 15<00:01:11.450> 2014<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.260> would

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
October 15 2014 so basically I would

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
October 15 2014 so basically I would
imagine<00:01:13.619> within<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.189> range<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
imagine within that range is when the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
imagine within that range is when the
game<00:01:15.150> again<00:01:15.360> release<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.500> guess<00:01:16.830> maybe

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
game again release I would guess maybe

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
game again release I would guess maybe
the<00:01:18.270> fourth<00:01:18.869> quarter<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:20.090> 2014<00:01:21.200> there's<00:01:22.200> an

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
