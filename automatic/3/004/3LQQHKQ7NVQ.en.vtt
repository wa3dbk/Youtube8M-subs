00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have curdled which is what the bed on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.230 
have curdled which is what the bed on
buttermilk<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.630> essentially<00:01:28.530> curdled<00:01:28.979> milk

five minutes have passed and we have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
five minutes have passed and we have
buttermilk<00:01:35.490> much<00:01:36.150> easier<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.630> running<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
