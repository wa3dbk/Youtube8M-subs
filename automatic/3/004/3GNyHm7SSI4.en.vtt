00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.020
 hello in this new video tutorial 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.530
 we will see how to make a usb memory 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.500
 a key to start windows 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.410
 once finished the steps that we are going to 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.180
 perform the system should restart itself is 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.400
 that's why I'm showing you 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.370
 through a virtual environment and 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.240
 spiritual pc 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.100
 First, let's start 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.530
 My PC 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.140
 and here is my memory do you see that the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.390
 system has given you the letter 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.579
 then to be able to make this video 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.590
 tutorial my usb memory should have 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 assigned the letter a but if you give yourself 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 account the diskette already assigned to it 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.199
 what we will do is disable the floppy disk 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.450
 to be able to give it to the memory you see the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.520
 letter 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.090
 we minimize let's start my pc click 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.090
 right properties 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.190
 in this window as well as where it says 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.190
 hardware device manager 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 and where it says diskette drive april 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.100
 we click and we give development 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.940
 we say yes and the unit is left 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 disabled 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.120
 with this you realize the diskette no longer 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.610
 appears and we can give it to usb memory 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.530
 with the letter e now the letter a 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.100
 what we will do now is change the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.330
 letter to the unit we minimize those of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.330
 start my pc right click admin 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.329
 here we go to the disk manager 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.070
 and where is this usb memory with the letter d 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.630
 we give right click change the law of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.090
 broken trance access to the unit 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.600
 we click change 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.640
 and here we choose the letter 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.180
 let's accept we say yes 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 Y 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 the usb memory will now have the lyrics 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.970
 once you have finished all these 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.350
 steps we are going to make of our memory 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.060
 usb a key to start windows 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.310
 let's start run 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.690
 here in this window we write if it is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.569
 gay accept in this window ensure the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 windows accounts database 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.480
 we click on update 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.659
 and this other window that says key to 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.390
 start we are in this option store 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.799
 the start key on a disk requires 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.470
 that a disc is inserted during the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.629
 start of the system this disk will be 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.990
 our usb memory so that it gives us 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.700
 to the system we click 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.700
 and from here everything will be to accept 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.099
 now we remove our usb memory 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.780
 so that when restarting the system this one 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.159
 ask us to enter it again 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.159
 to make way for the system 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.510
 then we restart our machine 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.510
 virtual 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.420
 Here we appear this window that record 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.920
 main start windows xp and we 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.050
 says this equipment requires a disk 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.910
 during the start insert the disk and 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.340
 click on accept if you do not have it and 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.260
 you click on accept this message appears 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.610
 I do not know against the file stated the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.370
 start key file is not 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.400
 found on the disk of the unit e 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.900
 insert the correct disk accept 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.900
 then we enter our 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.060
 we click on accept 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.260
 and so we can enter the system now 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.110
 what we do is put our 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.080
 start password as we do 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.730
 normally on our team and here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.730
 we will enter winters 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.410
 This is all if you do not want it anymore 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.060
 continue to use 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.120
 let's start 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.230
 to run in this same window 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.320
 we have if we accept or update 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.050
 and here this second option to the maximum the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.600
 start key fully stores a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.190
 key as part of the operating system and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.390
 no interaction is required during the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.480
 vision system we click on accept 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.969
 to accept 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.969
 7 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.519
 and so your usb memory is no longer a 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.739
 good system start key this 

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.610
 it was all in this video tutorial 

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:05.249
 hoping it has been great 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.249
 help and see you in the next goodbye
