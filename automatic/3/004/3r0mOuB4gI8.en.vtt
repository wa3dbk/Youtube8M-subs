I<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:27.459> find<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.730> phone<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> very<00:03:28.720> full<00:03:29.050> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
I just find that phone is very full and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.320 
I just find that phone is very full and
then<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.629> if<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.920> space<00:03:33.459> but<00:03:34.000> you're

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
then so if you like a space but you're

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.660 
then so if you like a space but you're
looking<00:03:34.480> for<00:03:34.750> something<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.459> usual

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
looking for something not in the usual
