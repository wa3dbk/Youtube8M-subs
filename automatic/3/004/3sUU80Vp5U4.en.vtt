00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Do you care about water quality? 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.850
 mineral that you consume 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.189
 according to experts, it must have the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 ideal alkalinity index ie the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 ability to neutralize the maximum of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.120
 strong a chemical made some tests 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 in gallon mineral water and the result 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 It is not within determined by 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.689
 ministry of health 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.330
 when buying a gallon of mineral water as 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.640
 this one the consumer must be attentive 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 this label that comes with the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 specifications of the chemical composition of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.719
 Water 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.850
 in this the ph at 25 degrees celsius is 4.48 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.280
 according to the ministry of health the ideal ph 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 water for human consumption should be 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 between 6 and 9.5 if the ideal for me for me 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 For me to manage is a water of ph 7 means to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 choice that I would make between the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.170
 pick up four and a half the wizard of ph in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.020
 around 8 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 my body requires more water 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.910
 alkali possible and no water 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.549
 reagent which can be found in 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 shops for fish products any 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 person can test the quality of the water 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.200
 people put is five drops of this regent 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.540
 in the water 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.049
 already in each of the waters and we act 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.530
 with her for a while so people 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.869
 can mix this regent well with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.409
 coloration will tell us if this water 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.960
 is within the ideal range or is 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 outside the final part the chemist still 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 warning about the chlorine content present 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 in tap water and the risks to the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.009
 when this water is consumed without 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.570
 pass through a filter or purifier. 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.280
 chlorine content in water will determine 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 by coloring according to the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.210
 take it and gives you the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 amount of chlorine that we can have 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.950
 in the water that's what I have for you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.470
 she has tap water from the region and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 and as you can see it has an index 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.189
 very high chlorine 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.770
 the tint should be yellow 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.600
 green or has too much chlorine in the water 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
 in contrast we have water 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.420
 also treated 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 only that no chlorine was removed from that hour. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.670
 water so that we can see 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.220
 really what 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.780
 this water would be an ideal water for 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.610
 We can be eating then we 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.360
 we have two waters ac2 two samples of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.860
 tap water one with chlorine and 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.459
 another who also had the same treatment 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.950
 but with the removal of chlorine ideal for 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.140
 people consume because koro has to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.930
 being in the water to disinfect the water is 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.690
 a very powerful disinfectant for 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 eliminate bacteria and germs but can not 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 be ingested at the time of consumption 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.560
 Chlorine can not present your body
