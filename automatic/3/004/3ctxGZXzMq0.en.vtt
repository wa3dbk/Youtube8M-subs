00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
foot pedal people were asking about you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.829 
foot pedal people were asking about you
know<00:00:05.549> when<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.730> use<00:00:05.879> them<00:00:06.029> for<00:00:06.060> practice<00:00:06.629> okay<00:00:06.810> I

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
know when I use them for practice okay I

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.259 
know when I use them for practice okay I
have<00:00:07.140> missed<00:00:07.410> height<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:08.220> they'll<00:00:08.519> go<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.090> it

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
have missed height as they'll go and it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.930 
have missed height as they'll go and it
really<00:00:09.300> works<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.340> Achilles<00:00:11.340> tendon<00:00:11.370> into

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
really works the Achilles tendon into

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.839 
really works the Achilles tendon into
calf<00:00:12.120> muscles<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.840> like<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.710> said<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.009> try

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
calf muscles so like I said I just try

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.820 
calf muscles so like I said I just try
this<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.509> couple<00:00:16.199> minutes<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.680> I'm

this for a couple minutes here and I'm
RT<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.490> running<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.970> breath<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:19.220> it's<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
RT like running out of breath so it's a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.070 
RT like running out of breath so it's a
good<00:00:20.430> workout<00:00:20.730> pedal<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> usually<00:00:21.449> normally

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
good workout pedal it I usually normally

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.220 
good workout pedal it I usually normally
use<00:00:22.859> them<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.230> foam<00:00:25.789> inside<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.779> when

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
use them with the foam inside and when

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.300 
use them with the foam inside and when
you<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
you do it like that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.370 
you do it like that
this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.269> volume<00:00:32.780> my<00:00:33.780> volume<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this is your volume my volume on the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.670 
this is your volume my volume on the
floor<00:00:38.840> like<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> said<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> practice<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
floor like I said when you practice on

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
floor like I said when you practice on
the<00:00:40.739> floor<00:00:40.980> when<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> drop<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.420> drop

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the floor when you drop your you drop

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.180 
the floor when you drop your you drop
your<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.559> drop<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
your you know you just drop like that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
your you know you just drop like that
you<00:00:44.489> were<00:00:44.610> only<00:00:44.760> working<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.840> upstroke

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you were only working on the upstroke

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
you were only working on the upstroke
because<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> pick<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.370> leg<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
because when you pick up your leg and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.400 
because when you pick up your leg and
let<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> fall<00:00:48.390> you're<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.930> doing<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> where

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
let it fall you're not doing it where

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
let it fall you're not doing it where
gravity<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> foot<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
gravity is so when you do the foot you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
gravity is so when you do the foot you
push<00:00:51.870> down<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.039> feel<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> tension<00:00:53.579> on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
push down you can feel the tension on

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
push down you can feel the tension on
this<00:00:54.030> muscle<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> comes<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:55.980> up

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
this muscle and when it comes back up

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.510 
this muscle and when it comes back up
you<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.640> feel<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.750> tension<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> see

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you really feel the tension so you see

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.860 
you really feel the tension so you see
how<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> muscle<00:01:00.059> moves<00:01:02.329> that's<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.690> it's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
how the muscle moves that's because it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
how the muscle moves that's because it's
pushing<00:01:04.080> my<00:01:04.379> foot<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:04.920> normally<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
pushing my foot up now normally when I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.410 
pushing my foot up now normally when I
practice<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.350> run<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> foots<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.040> full

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
practice I run with the foots is full

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.200 
practice I run with the foots is full
open<00:01:09.530> at<00:01:10.530> 90<00:01:10.920> degrees

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
open at 90 degrees

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
open at 90 degrees
yeah<00:01:12.900> take<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> screws<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> bottom

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
yeah take the screws out on the bottom

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.380 
yeah take the screws out on the bottom
I'm<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.430> gonna<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.000> now

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I'm not gonna do that right now

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
I'm not gonna do that right now
I've<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.750> other<00:01:15.869> videos<00:01:16.259> demonstrating<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I've got other videos demonstrating that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.789 
I've got other videos demonstrating that
and<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> numbers<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.229> asking<00:01:19.530> me<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and so the numbers were asking me can

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.320 
and so the numbers were asking me can
you<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.310> double<00:01:20.549> stroke<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you do like a double stroke on it of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:36.219 
you do like a double stroke on it of
course<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> heel<00:01:22.619> toe

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.609 

actually<00:01:37.229> hear<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.070> need<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> take<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
actually hear it you need to take the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:03:06.770 
actually hear it you need to take the
card<00:01:40.619> out

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.870 

so<00:03:07.780> that's<00:03:08.470> part<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> reason<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.580> use<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
so that's part of the reason I use the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.210 
so that's part of the reason I use the
foot<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.330> says<00:03:10.480> portable<00:03:11.050> it's<00:03:11.800> quiet

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
foot like it says portable it's quiet

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.540 
foot like it says portable it's quiet
