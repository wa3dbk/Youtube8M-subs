00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 which game has the most bulky 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.500
 complex interface where first appeared 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.179
 normal facial animation and on which 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 The engine has been set and the largest number 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.790
 of games 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:29.340
 answers to these and many other questions you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:31.710
 find the paciao interface game 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 video games a facet useful with his 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 using the rock knows about the state of health 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 the amount of cartridge available in the arsenal 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 adaptations and so on modern 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 gaming products from 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
 interface are increasingly trying to give up 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.640
 perhaps creatives among 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 developers believe that he is callous 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 people's eyes well maybe something else me 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's not really that much and itâ€™s equal to how 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 probably, and you, after all, we want to know 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 where is the most cumbersome and complex interface 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 which we will need to disassemble 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 a decent amount of time someone 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 may immediately thought but besides arpeggios but 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.290
 unfortunately it will be a wrong move 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.299
 thinking only the interface of such games 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 gamer can customize so 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.140
 how she wants and what is the difficulty in mastering 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 practically absent but not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.979
 ability to customize the look 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 various indicators and indicators 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.430
 present in the brutal global 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 strategies died and europa universalis you 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 just look at this variety 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
 all sorts of information yes it will 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 even worse than the microsoft flight 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.610
 simulator 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.680
 straight eyes run up us war 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.439
 This interface will leave a lot 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.439
 time is not a week of course but decent 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.920
 facial animation in games was previously 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.659
 purely aesthetic element quite 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.220
 it was possible to do without it and with 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.360
 get divine pleasure 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 from passing the storyline 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320
 and not only the lines but time passes 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.149
 standards change and if earlier we 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 quite enough slightly moving lower 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.289
 the jaws of the mafia characters then now it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 it would be unacceptable to want good animation 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.000
 faces will start screaming players such things well 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 and now I will answer the question yes 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 more specifically since it is present 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 clarifying normal facial animation i 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.670
 it was already remembered first gun site on 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 point of the game is the game actively zhor 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.209
 wrote about beautiful facial animation 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.920
 this project and even I myself remember 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.870
 wild delight of moving eyebrows on 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.519
 characters but as for me from the end they are not 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.380
 fits the answer like a question about 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.540
 normal animation melts technically 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.950
 acceptable modern point of view well 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 then please love and favor 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 hr lisod this game was 1 which 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.530
 used modern technology 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.660
 motion-capture for shooting faces 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 the project itself of course passed by 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:45.420
 most gamers but critics by 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:46.829
 dignity appreciated the game itself 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 of course I set the interesting 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.739
 at last 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.239
 There are a lot of video games in our world and everything 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.709
 they are created on different engines 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.540
 some of the developers use 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.459
 bought and someone creates their 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.140
 own which later can 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.329
 buy other developers if he them 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.769
 will be attracted naturally for the last 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.389
 time in the gaming industry has formed 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.980
 own special love for individual engines 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.630
 from what on some of them started 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.160
 a huge amount 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.810
 projects but it would not be interesting 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.359
 talk about one of them 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.010
 so I decided to do the top 3 and remember 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.200
 what's the location of the villa taking into account 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.000
 official released games and so on 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 third place I put three engines at once 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.150
 since the number of games 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 developed on them varies 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 slightly source engine 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.780
 lead because jane and andre-louie jame 2 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.459
 first submission does not need 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.709
 we all somehow came across 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.840
 projects mist surprised a total of on 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.139
 this studio product was created 52 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.200
 games 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.150
 Next is the sprue andgein if the name 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.980
 you did not say anything is not a problem here 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.099
 better start by introducing the games themselves 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.190
 her cunt and now only soon thief and 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.690
 of course there were two yes all these games 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.640
 created on light so and jane 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.270
 joint studio products monolith and 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.360
 microsoft 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.280
 here it is not released 51 of the game well, and the last 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.980
 the engine of this place anril and jane 2 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.350
 together 60 three games created on it 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.320
 representation he does not need therefore 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.450
 go ahead second place it takes 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.670
 unity who is not evil wish river 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.620
 everyone heard about the unit especially given 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.180
 engine is popular among developers go 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.460
 and now it is not even surprising 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.560
 the fact that with 80 percent probability 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.450
 indie game used was his they 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.519
 own product or wife 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.970
 motor all on it released one hundred and six 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.610
 of games 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.180
 Well, the first place is unreal engine 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.060
 3 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.710
 You are surprised I personally do not have it appeared 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.000
 just one year after unity and became 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.820
 very popular among developers 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.530
 creating games triple and class and if 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.360
 look at the whole industry then 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.420
 of competitors he had only unity 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.420
 all on this motors was made 175 games 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.490
 subscribe to the channel put your fingers 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.020
 up and write your questions on 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.419
 game topics in the comments to this 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
 release the most interesting necessarily 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.290
 will get into the next game yet on this 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.870
 All at the microphone was Sergey Belousov 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.870
 Thank you for your attention until we meet again.
