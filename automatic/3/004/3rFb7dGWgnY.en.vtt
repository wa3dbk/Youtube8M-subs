00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
Hasbro's very Arras 145 wide ball I am

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100 
Hasbro's very Arras 145 wide ball I am
completely<00:02:56.670> shocked<00:02:57.090> by<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.870> Bey

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
completely shocked by this so this Bey

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.199 
completely shocked by this so this Bey
might<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.530> some<00:02:58.680> unknown<00:02:58.860> attack<00:02:59.400> potential

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
might have some unknown attack potential

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.059 
might have some unknown attack potential
I<00:03:00.239> guess<00:03:01.110> people<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.650> do<00:03:01.739> some<00:03:01.920> further

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
I guess people have to do some further

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.710 
I guess people have to do some further
testing<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.090> from<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.599> I've<00:03:03.690> seen

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
testing on it but from what I've seen

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
testing on it but from what I've seen
here<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.230> actually<00:03:04.680> does<00:03:04.829> pretty<00:03:05.040> good<00:03:05.130> when

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
here it actually does pretty good when

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.210 
here it actually does pretty good when
faced<00:03:05.760> off<00:03:05.940> against<00:03:06.150> takara<00:03:06.569> tomy<00:03:06.630> barriers

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
faced off against takara tomy barriers

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.680 
faced off against takara tomy barriers
