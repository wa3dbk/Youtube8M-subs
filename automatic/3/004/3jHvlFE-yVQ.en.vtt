00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.579
 hello everyone I'm again I come to 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.950
 make a card magic trick that 

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:10.570
 makes 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.959
 corn is missing is another that is made with a 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.959
 poker deck 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.270
 and well I'm not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.370
 Juan Tamariz would tell a spectator 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.740
 short 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.260
 in this case as there is no one is short 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.930
 I would cut 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.240
 and I'd say okay so it's cut 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.110
 this letter for you and this one for you 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.920
 they would look at them 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 each one of you 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 and I would leave it again 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 and if I'm going to leave 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.329
 then the day 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.850
 I can know something about you 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.990
 letters 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 and as is logical 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.100
 the person and not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.800
 and he said yes there may be something 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 I know that your letters are in the part 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.930
 top of the deck so I want that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 cuts to hide them the person 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320
 I would cut 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.530
 and he would say and now I can save about 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.530
 our letters 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.869
 the thing would say no longer I would say yes yes 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.299
 I know our letters are in the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.860
 center of the deck so I want that 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.110
 again cut again but not 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 exactly in the middle for later 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.970
 to move them up or to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.970
 down traksel would welcome short league 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.700
 I would say and right now there will be something 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.700
 more about our letters 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.420
 and the person would say no 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.859
 I would say so there will be something that you 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.240
 rule out these faults within the 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.470
 deck of cards 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.679
 so I want you to do two heaps 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.099
 placing a letter alternately 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.099
 we say true then 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.360
 would give the deck to a spectator and the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.900
 viewer would start doing the engines 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.900
 with the letters 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.069
 once you have finished I would tell them 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 already 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.409
 I do not know anything about our letters the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.890
 same video site 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.630
 each engine 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 good roads lack to know anything about 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.690
 them because I only with a magical pass 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.070
 I am able to make all the letters 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.280
 of each motor are the same color 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.280
 - Hello 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.080
 and of the holy vows I have less color 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.000
 one of which 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.470
 are your charges 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.940
 and here he has reached barracks to which 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.400
 public is to start the world again 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.470
 applaud 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.620

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.770
