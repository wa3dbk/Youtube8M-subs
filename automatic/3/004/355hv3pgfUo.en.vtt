00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
settings instead of the drift mode so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
settings instead of the drift mode so
once<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.660> kicked<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> drift<00:00:46.440> mode

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
once I kicked in the drift mode

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
once I kicked in the drift mode

some control over the car when you're

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539 
some control over the car when you're
using<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.290> controller<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> game<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
using a controller because this game is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
using a controller because this game is
meant<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.060> wheel<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.530> want<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> wheel<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
meant for a wheel and I I want a wheel I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.770 
meant for a wheel and I I want a wheel I
don't<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.970> yet<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.689> getting

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
don't have one yet but I will be getting

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.490 
don't have one yet but I will be getting
one<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.290> point<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.490> far<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.500> as

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
one at some point now as far as like as

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
one at some point now as far as like as
far<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.070> game<00:01:14.340> feels<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> how<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
far as how this game feels and how the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
far as how this game feels and how the
drifting<00:01:15.659> feels<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.189> nice<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.640> feels

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
drifting feels it's really nice it feels

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.990 
drifting feels it's really nice it feels
really<00:01:18.060> good<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:19.020> exactly<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.040> Forza

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
really good it's not exactly like Forza

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
really good it's not exactly like Forza
obviously<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.780> different

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
obviously it's going to be different

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
obviously it's going to be different
because<00:01:22.380> they're<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.070> game<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
because they're not the same game but

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
because they're not the same game but
it's<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.869> similar<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.860> set<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> up

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's some it's similar you can set it up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's some it's similar you can set it up
to<00:01:26.580> feel<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.330> Forza<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.409> want<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to feel like Forza if you really want to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.880 
to feel like Forza if you really want to
but<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.270> mine<00:01:30.570> set<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.229> mine<00:01:31.530> set<00:01:31.770> up

drifting but like I said I'm still still
really<00:01:47.670> starting<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.659> drifting<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.320> assetto

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
really starting out drifting in assetto

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.120 
really starting out drifting in assetto
corsa<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:50.189> still<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:51.290> beginner<00:01:52.290> ish<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
corsa I'm still very beginner ish at it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
corsa I'm still very beginner ish at it
I<00:01:53.340> guess<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.210> say<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.829> basically<00:01:55.829> what

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I guess you could say and basically what

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
I guess you could say and basically what
I<00:01:55.979> did<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.729> recorded<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I did here was I recorded I just kind of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
I did here was I recorded I just kind of
went<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> drift<00:01:58.890> session<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> record<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
went into a drift session and record and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
went into a drift session and record and
turned<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> fraps<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> tried<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> keep<00:02:02.040> going

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
turned on fraps and tried to keep going

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.840 
turned on fraps and tried to keep going
for<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.479> long<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> possibly<00:02:04.350> could<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
for as long as I possibly could and I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.760 
for as long as I possibly could and I
worked<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.210> some<00:02:06.390> pretty<00:02:06.540> good<00:02:06.750> combos<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
worked up some pretty good combos and I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.279 
worked up some pretty good combos and I
also<00:02:07.920> lost<00:02:08.340> some<00:02:08.729> combos<00:02:09.179> because<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> some

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
also lost some combos because of some

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100 
also lost some combos because of some
because<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.330> some<00:02:12.930> things

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
because well because of some some things

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
because well because of some some things
that<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.319> thought<00:02:13.590> were

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that I thought were

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
that I thought were
kind<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> stupid<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.700> went<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.210> mean<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
kind of stupid because I went I mean the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.480 
kind of stupid because I went I mean the
only<00:02:16.170> thing<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.590> don't<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:17.160> about<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
only thing that I don't like about the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.460 
only thing that I don't like about the
drift<00:02:17.700> scoring<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.390> game<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.840> where<00:02:19.230> if

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
drift scoring in this game is where if

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.490 
drift scoring in this game is where if
you<00:02:19.650> slow<00:02:20.100> down<00:02:20.430> too<00:02:21.330> much<00:02:21.570> it'll<00:02:22.050> take<00:02:22.380> your

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you slow down too much it'll take your

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.590 
you slow down too much it'll take your
points<00:02:22.830> away<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.400> slow<00:02:23.790> down<00:02:24.060> under

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
points away like if you slow down under

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.900 
points away like if you slow down under
a<00:02:24.630> certain<00:02:24.870> speed<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.980> boom<00:02:26.400> your<00:02:26.640> points

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a certain speed then boom your points

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.490 
a certain speed then boom your points
are<00:02:27.030> gone<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.570> think<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.020> little<00:02:28.230> bit

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
are gone and I think that's a little bit

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.200 
are gone and I think that's a little bit
I<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.280> don't<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.760> maybe

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
I don't know I don't like that maybe

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.640 
I don't know I don't like that maybe
they<00:02:30.390> should<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:31.410> should

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
they should I think that they should

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.450 
they should I think that they should
either<00:02:32.130> lower<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:33.440> lower<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.650> minimum<00:02:34.800> speed

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
either lower the lower the minimum speed

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.450 
either lower the lower the minimum speed
or<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:36.720> should<00:02:37.080> they<00:02:37.380> should<00:02:37.590> either<00:02:38.130> lower

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
or they should they should either lower

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.540 
or they should they should either lower
the<00:02:38.640> minimum<00:02:38.760> speed<00:02:39.270> or<00:02:39.680> they<00:02:40.680> should<00:02:40.860> remove

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the minimum speed or they should remove

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.700 
the minimum speed or they should remove
that<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.970> together<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:43.320> mean<00:02:43.620> I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
that all together and I mean I

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.170 
that all together and I mean I
understand<00:02:44.220> why<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.670> would<00:02:44.790> take<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> away

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
understand why they would take it away

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.230 
understand why they would take it away
or<00:02:45.630> take<00:02:45.870> points<00:02:46.230> away<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.710> going<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:48.150> know

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
or take points away for going you know

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810 
or take points away for going you know
too<00:02:48.300> far<00:02:48.570> past<00:02:48.890> drift<00:02:49.890> angle<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.460> completely

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
too far past drift angle I completely

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.430 
too far past drift angle I completely
understand<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.690> that's<00:02:52.080> underst

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
understand that because that's underst

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.270 
understand that because that's underst
you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:52.890> completely

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
you know that's completely

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.150 
you know that's completely
understandable<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.000> drifting<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.350> think

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
understandable in drifting but I think

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.100 
understandable in drifting but I think
that<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.430> should<00:02:56.459> they<00:02:57.180> should<00:02:57.209> they

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that they should they should they

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.560 
that they should they should they
shouldn't<00:02:58.440> punish<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.090> for<00:03:00.090> slowing<00:03:00.360> down

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
shouldn't punish you for slowing down

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.910 
shouldn't punish you for slowing down
too<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> stopped<00:03:01.650> or

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
too much like if you stopped or

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.449 
too much like if you stopped or
something

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
something

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.820 
something
they<00:03:03.090> take<00:03:03.540> your<00:03:03.660> points<00:03:03.990> away<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.770> don't

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
they take your points away and I don't

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.470 
they take your points away and I don't
know<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.640> they<00:03:05.910> should<00:03:05.940> take<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.300> out

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
know I think they should take that out

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
know I think they should take that out
but<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.230> depends<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.340> rules<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
but it depends you know the rules that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.180 
but it depends you know the rules that
the<00:03:09.030> drifting<00:03:09.450> score<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.470> drift<00:03:10.740> scoring

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
the drifting score the drift scoring

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.760 
the drifting score the drift scoring
system<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.700> game<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.930> mean<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.440> it's

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
system in this game is I mean it's it's

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.040 
system in this game is I mean it's it's
close<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.550> real<00:03:14.820> life<00:03:15.060> system<00:03:15.780> obviously

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
close to a real life system obviously

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.780 
close to a real life system obviously
it's<00:03:16.380> missing<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:17.070> things<00:03:17.100> because<00:03:17.520> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it's missing some things because you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.759 
it's missing some things because you
don't<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:18.030> real-life<00:03:18.239> judges<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.320> mean

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
don't have real-life judges but I mean

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.040 
don't have real-life judges but I mean
for<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.010> point<00:03:20.400> system<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.840> pretty

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
for a point system it's it's pretty

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.600 
for a point system it's it's pretty
decent<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.620> my<00:03:22.739> opinion<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.190> actually<00:03:23.459> works

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
decent in my opinion it actually works

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.910 
decent in my opinion it actually works
pretty<00:03:23.790> well<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.300> there<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.380> one<00:03:25.680> big<00:03:25.709> thing

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
pretty well and there is one big thing

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.590 
pretty well and there is one big thing
that<00:03:26.130> Forza<00:03:26.670> could<00:03:26.850> learn<00:03:27.000> from<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.390> game

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that Forza could learn from this game

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.890 
that Forza could learn from this game

this<00:03:50.880> game<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.239> kind<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.630> in-between<00:03:51.750> those

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this game is kind of in-between those

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.840 
this game is kind of in-between those
two<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.709> kind<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.100> between<00:03:53.190> fours<00:03:53.700> of

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
two it's kind of in between fours of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.030 
two it's kind of in between fours of
smoke<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.180> Gran<00:03:54.390> Turismo<00:03:54.570> smoke<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.890> think

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
smoke and Gran Turismo smoke and I think

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.650 
smoke and Gran Turismo smoke and I think
the<00:03:56.130> smoke<00:03:56.340> looks<00:03:56.580> decent<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.209> game<00:03:57.450> it's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
the smoke looks decent in this game it's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.570 
the smoke looks decent in this game it's
obviously<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.709> obviously<00:03:59.070> not<00:03:59.310> going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.519> be

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
obviously it's obviously not going to be

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.350 
obviously it's obviously not going to be

before experiencing any slowdown I

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.560 
before experiencing any slowdown I
haven't<00:04:23.460> tested<00:04:23.610> them<00:04:23.940> yet<00:04:24.120> they're<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570

settings as they are right now are
really<00:04:26.880> high<00:04:27.060> there

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
really high there

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
really high there
they're<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.400> most<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.640> settings

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
graphics wise are in the very high

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.480 
graphics wise are in the very high
category<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.870> haven't<00:04:34.320> tested<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.950> on<00:04:35.160> Macs

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
category but I haven't tested it on Macs

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.000 
category but I haven't tested it on Macs
so<00:04:35.910> I'll<00:04:36.510> test<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.140> Macs<00:04:37.410> at<00:04:37.590> some<00:04:37.800> point

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
so I'll test it on Macs at some point

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.800 
so I'll test it on Macs at some point
and<00:04:38.130> see<00:04:38.280> how<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.490> actually<00:04:38.520> works<00:04:39.030> out<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.570> and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
and see how it actually works out so and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.320 
and see how it actually works out so and
like<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.380> said<00:04:40.530> if<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.830> works<00:04:41.100> out<00:04:41.340> really<00:04:41.970> well

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
like I said if it works out really well

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.570 
like I said if it works out really well
then<00:04:43.050> maybe<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.500> will<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:44.040> know<00:04:44.160> maybe<00:04:44.370> I'll

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
then maybe I will you know maybe I'll

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.280 
then maybe I will you know maybe I'll
just<00:04:44.730> keep<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.060> on<00:04:45.180> Macs<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.660> just<00:04:46.140> keep
