00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.460
 skyrim is well and truly in this top 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.469
 30 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.859
 to tell the truth, I am rather happy because 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.480
 it's a game that I enjoy a lot 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.740
 after more than 100 hours of play this one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.769
 hides me still full of mystery and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
 it is something very nice this 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.620
 that I liked most in this game is the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 simple walk in the 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.310
 cities between kate it in a bar 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 take a little skouma listen to a bar 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 to sing for me you tell me waits 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.129
 is still better in this game 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 that a glass of alcohol and a cantor of 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.800
 rubbish 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.320
 yes of course but the subject is so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.610
 vast that I would lose myself because 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.140
 should I start with the atmosphere 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.070
 fantastic sound that is child 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 the moment I speak to you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.790
 or by the environments that are 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 the most varied I've ever seen by 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.860
 being able to buy a house or 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 to adopt a child 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.110
 or maybe by the number of weapons of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 shouts and spells just this Dantesque 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.620
 so yes skyrim deserves his place more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 that no other game has revolutionized the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.950
 rpg in many ways and I would say 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.280
 that the open world has developed with 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.280
 his help 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.400
 because this one had for a long time 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.960
 biggest map in a video game and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.310
 celebrate that some players have to 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 right now still not finished the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.030
 game so this one is filled with 4 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.229
 secondary and I would only see one point 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.700
 that they can put off some 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.930
 it 's level system and the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.850
 progress that is slowly 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.229
 start but next if you're a player 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.360
 roleplay or who knows how to savor the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.899
 details of a game says heather scrolls 5 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.799
 skyrim and the perfect game for you 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.330
 personally I also recommend to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.470
 those who have a pc to go see on the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.210
 shock steamworks because the game is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.680
 customizable using fashion or 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.430
 you discover the soul of a creator of 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 fashion why not 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.280
 on this world it's dark and me 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.660
 respectfully salute and you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.810
 wait in the edge province of 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.810
 sky 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 hello all I'll tell you what 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.370
 my support on skyrim and I will do 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
 all that without moving the lips a single 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.660
 times in the game huh because otherwise in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 that moment it would have made something of 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.310
 kind 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.270
 ok I'm stopping I remember I got 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.760
 skyrim 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.110
 by buying it on the internet by the way 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.020
 remember it particularly because 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.600
 I waited two weeks to get it 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.340
 and I tried them after playing 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.800
 oblivion which must be for most 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.410
 people the best aldo scroll and at 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.270
 early I played an hour or two I got 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.240
 I said yeah I'll play later I 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.400
 not very amusing and at the end of a 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.180
 week I replayed then skyrim and 2 of the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.340
 my favorite game 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.640
 and what attached me in this game is 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.020
 immersion and the life that da 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.670
 for immersion skyrim has his 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.920
 own universe and customization 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 of quite a thorough character that makes 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.190
 that we enter directly into the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.140
 character we create also has his own 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.390
 own leveling system that wants 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.780
 add his little when the one on 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.270
 the immersion 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.220
 thanks to this leveling system we pass 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.430
 at the beginning of the game a stadium that looks 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430
 to that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.230
 tuesday august 18 i love zimmer is not 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:14.739
 because of the bit to this when we play 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.510
 long skyrim here I killed all 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.810
 fans dies in discretion mode one can 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.370
 to say they did not see anything coming and so 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.290
 when you increase a skill thoroughly 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.940
 we tend to end up in 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.920
 situations totally anything 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.200
 like increase the discretion thoroughly by 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.410
 example we tend to find ourselves 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.609
 in situations we would like the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.349
 game disappear in another 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.909
 dimension 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.739
 hello ok I would like you to go out 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.590
 with your head too and that you can 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.650
 see here hemera j if I press the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.909
 jump button I'm talking who will react or 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.909
 will see if this guy 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.890
 to add a point to the immersion the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.780
 NPCs react about what is happening 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.909
 goes into edge of heaven and choices that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.360
 you do for example if you help a 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.799
 once you are indebted and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.450
 will tell you something friendly by 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.530
 against if you have something that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.069
 could not have a psg 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 he will bring when he sees 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.829
 then this game has a life time 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.570
 colossale skyrim has countless 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.639
 quests all different than any that 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.440
 others and whoever will try to 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.820
 complete finish will have to start at 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.080
 work hard 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.000
 especially since bordeaux heaven is a 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.889
 fairly large terrain with two people 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.100
 scattered everywhere and that is 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.440
 also completely solo to finish I 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.330
 would say that casual gamers 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.550
 must at least leave once and 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.740
 the echoes 6 10 as a gamer 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.090
 confirm you do not have terrible 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.470
 you can talk about keirin the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.449
 president of the smad fantasize at this game 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.979
 after registration sequence set 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.110
 crazy scene that will be reminiscent 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.130
 michael bay australia escape from 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.720
 google to land on the ground 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.310
 new edge of sun sky radiates 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.300
 the grass beats with the wind and you 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.020
 see not far from the mountains 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.639
 imposing 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.590
 then you understand what that 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.669
 happens is pure freedom and this is 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.229
 that on leaving this drug that the 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.310
 game really starts and the frame 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.930
 main will allow you to discover 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.070
 the important points of the country puts you 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.840
 of the feat and this when you the 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.060

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.229
 these caves simin these brothels qua non and 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.030
 if they delay more the concept lidar head 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.490
 introduced united darty which for me very 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.139
 important because accentuates considerably 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.880
 immersion a founding element of to 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.500
 be a nose cause and that can not be 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.060
 connected in any of you feel 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.410
 concerting view to improve the game of

 base they are players

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.820
 solid around this game he knew 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.500
 which only aims to make us live 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.760

 baal and serve you know you if you 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.820

 unique go do not know what what 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.400
 cui cui paul tells us that the game 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:13.509
 big hollow to the stunned you 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.699
 find that the game will be better with 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.909
 of course of course assignments is by 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.430
 right here 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.379
 go to the locals as with this 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.849
 there is something for everyone 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.210
 young people it's just a slogan it was 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.819
 cool 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.409
 here is the cursed dig also according to 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.819
 me a chasm between the pc version and 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.259
 game consoles to note of course that the 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.789
 console game remains excellent but without 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.759
 this extra touch of freedom 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.319
 if so well received I had 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.270
 some time so that art in the 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.830
 video game could be summed up instead 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.089
 that these in our heart then 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.499
 yes this definition with a little 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.150
 simplistic it would be necessary to ask more 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:44.319
 seriously to meet those big 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.879
 questions what is art in the 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.830
 video game but I find the answer very 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.210
 little to the dic is so ultimately what 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.110
 come is for me a work of art case 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.060
 will always stay in my heart 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.180
 and of course I hope in yours but 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.550
 sarah do not forget my old story 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.139
 karim is the video game we can do 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.159
 what we want in an open world that 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.990
 is completely free 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:04.149
 you can become a bad guy 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.219
 character be a nice boy or even 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:07.419
 both and all we do at a 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.099
 repercussion in the world 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.050
 the guards are even aware of this 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.939
 is going on in edge of heaven and who 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.039
 says open world says keith and quests 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.839
 there is but the backhoe or anything 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.180
 that you want above there is a 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:21.039
 Gargantuan number of kate in this game 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.899
 even you do not do anything a quest 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.099
 come to you and when we have more than 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.560
 quests to do is panic 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.999
 we look in all the game at the 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.800
 looking for kate not to support 

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:32.919
 on the button go back to the menu desktop 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.449
 and the game is terribly immersive the 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.459
 creation and personalization of 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.439
 character makes that one enters this 

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:41.050
 universe but in the first second of 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:43.060
 Skyrim game is also enormously addictive 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.770
 yes play an hour and you're gone 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.599
 for the game but hundreds of hours 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.620
 like candy crooked and that's what I 

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:49.620
 really liked in skyrim
