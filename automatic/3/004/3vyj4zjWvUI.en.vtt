00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
we get to that our trivia question the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.459 
we get to that our trivia question the
most<00:00:12.059> recent<00:00:12.179> full<00:00:12.570> moon<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> harvest

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
most recent full moon was the harvest

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.690 
most recent full moon was the harvest
moon<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.099> closest<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
moon because it was the closest to the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.420 
moon because it was the closest to the
autumnal<00:00:14.940> equinox<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:16.680> trivia<00:00:16.980> question<00:00:17.310> is

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
autumnal equinox the trivia question is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.980 
autumnal equinox the trivia question is
how<00:00:17.580> many<00:00:17.640> full<00:00:17.970> moons<00:00:18.210> will<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
how many full moons will we have in the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.340 
how many full moons will we have in the
year<00:00:19.350> 2011<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.760> Arts<00:00:21.750> will<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.960> given<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
year 2011 the Arts will be given at the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.730 
year 2011 the Arts will be given at the
end<00:00:23.150> but<00:00:24.150> we've<00:00:24.300> had<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.779> many<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.199> players<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
end but we've had so many see players in

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859 
end but we've had so many see players in
the<00:00:25.800> last<00:00:25.920> 24<00:00:26.430> hours<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:27.180> finding<00:00:27.810> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the last 24 hours I'm finding it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
the last 24 hours I'm finding it
difficult<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> keep<00:00:28.410> count<00:00:28.740> however<00:00:29.609> we've

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
difficult to keep count however we've

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
difficult to keep count however we've
not<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> single<00:00:30.330> mville<00:00:30.779> errors<00:00:31.050> yet<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
not had a single mville errors yet so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.020 
not had a single mville errors yet so
while<00:00:32.219> we're<00:00:32.340> having<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.730> minor

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
while we're having all this minor

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410 
while we're having all this minor
flaring<00:00:33.480> activity<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> no<00:00:34.829> major<00:00:35.040> flares<00:00:35.550> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
flaring activity and no major flares so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.639 
flaring activity and no major flares so
let's<00:00:36.540> take<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> look<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> active<00:00:37.260> regions

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
let's take a look at the active regions

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
let's take a look at the active regions
and<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.219> find<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.579> why<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.719> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and see if we can find out why we have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.510 
and see if we can find out why we have
time<00:00:40.140> officially<00:00:40.590> numbered<00:00:40.890> active<00:00:41.219> regions

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
time officially numbered active regions

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.729 
time officially numbered active regions
on<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> disk<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> moment<00:00:42.570> plus<00:00:43.140> 3<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.530> yet

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
on the disk at the moment plus 3 as yet

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.920 
on the disk at the moment plus 3 as yet
unknown<00:00:44.129> word<00:00:44.280> regions<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.600> let's<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
unknown word regions so let's take a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
unknown word regions so let's take a
look<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.170> each<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.410> individually<00:00:46.860> starting

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
look at each one individually starting

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
look at each one individually starting
with<00:00:47.670> region<00:00:47.940> 1287<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> southwest<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
with region 1287 in the southwest as you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
with region 1287 in the southwest as you
can<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.850> from<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.090> pictures<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.840> very

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
can see from these pictures is very

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
can see from these pictures is very
close<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> limit<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.520> difficult

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
close to the limit it's very difficult

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
close to the limit it's very difficult
to<00:00:53.940> tell<00:00:54.149> whether<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.360> region<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.809> about

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to tell whether this region is about

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.680 
to tell whether this region is about
growing<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.920> decaying<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.420> we're<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
growing or decaying but we're going to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000 
growing or decaying but we're going to
be<00:00:57.780> losing<00:00:57.960> his<00:00:58.170> day<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> point

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
be losing his day so I think the point

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
be losing his day so I think the point
is<00:00:59.190> moot<00:00:59.480> next<00:01:00.480> we'll<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:00.899> at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is moot next we'll take a look at

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.149 
is moot next we'll take a look at
regions<00:01:01.379> 1289<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.399> 1293<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> northwest

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
regions 1289 and 1293 in the northwest

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
regions 1289 and 1293 in the northwest
region<00:01:05.159> 1289<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.970> by<00:01:06.119> far<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> largest<00:01:06.689> group

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
region 1289 is by far the largest group

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.850 
region 1289 is by far the largest group
around<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:08.580> produced<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.420> flares

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
around that has produced no see flares

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.140 
around that has produced no see flares
it<00:01:10.860> looks<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.130> though<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.430> grown<00:01:11.700> somewhat

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it looks as though it's grown somewhat

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
it looks as though it's grown somewhat
overnight<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> major

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
overnight you can see that the major

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.710 
overnight you can see that the major
spotters<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.610> continued<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> elongate<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
spotters have continued to elongate and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.550 
spotters have continued to elongate and
the<00:01:16.560> satellite<00:01:17.159> spots<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.880> prominent

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
the satellite spots are more prominent

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.039 
the satellite spots are more prominent
similarly<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.650> region<00:01:19.890> 1293<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.759> grown<00:01:21.049> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
similarly in region 1293 has grown the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
similarly in region 1293 has grown the
leader<00:01:22.560> spot<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.159> larger<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> has<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
leader spot is much larger and has got a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020 
leader spot is much larger and has got a
bigger<00:01:24.450> penumbra<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.159> trailer<00:01:26.700> spot<00:01:26.909> has

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
bigger penumbra and the trailer spot has

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.120 
bigger penumbra and the trailer spot has
developed<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:27.780> further<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> new<00:01:28.920> region

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
developed as well further a new region

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
developed as well further a new region
which<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.610> yet<00:01:29.790> unknown<00:01:29.970> bird<00:01:30.360> has

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
which is as yet unknown bird has

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
which is as yet unknown bird has
appeared<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.710> West<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.820> growth<00:01:33.030> has

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
appeared out to its West this growth has

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
appeared out to its West this growth has
been<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.570> rapid<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> region<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.890> worth

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
been very rapid so this region is worth

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
been very rapid so this region is worth
keeping<00:01:35.430> an<00:01:35.490> eye<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.750> next<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.840> move<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
keeping an eye on next we move to the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.319 
keeping an eye on next we move to the
southwest<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> look<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.189> regions<00:01:38.520> 1290<00:01:39.210> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
southwest and look at regions 1290 in

the Newton numbered region 1297 clearly
region<00:01:43.200> 1290<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.250> decayed<00:01:44.820> significantly

region 1290 has decayed significantly

produced for C flares whereas region

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.719 
produced for C flares whereas region
1297<00:01:51.780> has<00:01:52.049> grown<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.560> rapidly<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.430> quite

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
1297 has grown very rapidly and is quite

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
an impressive region and they claim that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.640 
an impressive region and they claim that
his<00:01:56.520> only<00:01:56.700> produced<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.750> flares

his only produced to see flares

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.830 
his only produced to see flares
I<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.610> been<00:01:59.670> some

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
I think there's been some

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.760 
I think there's been some
misidentification<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> flares<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
misidentification of flares here but I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
misidentification of flares here but I
have<00:02:01.980> no<00:02:02.160> way<00:02:02.370> of<00:02:02.520> checking<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.150> guess<00:02:03.390> it'll

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
have no way of checking so I guess it'll

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.470 
have no way of checking so I guess it'll
just<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.050> stand<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.620> way<00:02:04.940> region<00:02:05.940> 12<00:02:05.970> 92

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
just have to stand that way region 12 92

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.690 
just have to stand that way region 12 92
is<00:02:07.110> nearing<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.830> Center<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> northern

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
changed a great deal overnight however

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.840 
changed a great deal overnight however
there<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> new<00:02:13.530> region<00:02:13.830> propping<00:02:14.610> up<00:02:14.700> ahead

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
there is a new region propping up ahead

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.640 
there is a new region propping up ahead
of<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.200> collection<00:02:16.380> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
of it but there's just a collection of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.680

very<00:02:16.830> small<00:02:17.100> pores<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.300> magnetic<00:02:18.660> field

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
very small pores and the magnetic field

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.450 
very small pores and the magnetic field
looks<00:02:19.020> quite<00:02:19.290> disorganized<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> don't

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
looks quite disorganized so I don't

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.800 
looks quite disorganized so I don't
expect<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:21.000> region<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> amount<00:02:21.750> to

expect this from region to amount to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410 
expect this from region to amount to
much<00:02:22.020> next<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> look<00:02:23.370> at<00:02:23.460> region<00:02:23.760> 1294

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
much next we take a look at region 1294

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.290 
much next we take a look at region 1294
in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> south<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.520> relatively<00:02:26.970> modest

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
in the south this is a relatively modest

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.760 
in the south this is a relatively modest
sized<00:02:27.510> region<00:02:27.990> but<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.230> looks<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.530> though<00:02:28.560> it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
sized region but it looks as though it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.860 
sized region but it looks as though it's
decaying<00:02:29.070> currently<00:02:29.670> despite<00:02:30.300> what<00:02:30.510> noah

flares in the last 24 hours next we'll

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.850 
flares in the last 24 hours next we'll
take<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.250> look<00:02:38.459> at<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> complex<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.300> 1295<00:02:40.050> 1296

take a look at the complex of 1295 1296

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
been one fair possibly two flares

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.830 
been one fair possibly two flares
associated<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.560> three<00:02:49.890> regions

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.090 
associated with these three regions
anyway<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:51.930> surprised<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.440> these<00:02:52.500> regions

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
anyway I'm surprised that these regions

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.220 
anyway I'm surprised that these regions
not<00:02:53.250> produced<00:02:53.580> more<00:02:53.730> flares<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.600> first

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
not produced more flares because first

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.390 
not produced more flares because first
of<00:02:55.320> all<00:02:55.440> they're<00:02:55.590> quite<00:02:55.800> strong<00:02:56.160> they're

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
of all they're quite strong they're

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400 
of all they're quite strong they're
changing<00:02:56.790> quite<00:02:57.120> rapidly<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.380> a

changing quite rapidly and they have a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.620 
changing quite rapidly and they have a
chance<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.830> interact<00:02:59.070> with<00:02:59.310> one<00:02:59.550> another

chance to interact with one another
we've<00:03:00.630> already<00:03:00.780> mentioned<00:03:01.110> two<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.680> as

we've already mentioned two of you as
yet<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> number<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.670> regions<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.720> third<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.170> is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
yet a number of regions the third one is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
yet a number of regions the third one is
down<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.890> southeast<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:06.690> a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
down in the southeast and is a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.740 
down in the southeast and is a
conglomeration<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.680> small<00:03:07.980> spots<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:09.630> worth

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
conglomeration of small spots it's worth

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
conglomeration of small spots it's worth
keeping<00:03:09.959> an<00:03:10.170> eye<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.890> moment<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
keeping an eye on but at the moment I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.380 
keeping an eye on but at the moment I
don't<00:03:11.489> think<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> produce<00:03:12.030> very

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
don't think it's going to produce very

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.509 
don't think it's going to produce very
much<00:03:12.570> in<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> way<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.989> flares<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:14.130> overall

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
much in the way of flares so overall

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.630 
much in the way of flares so overall
solar<00:03:15.090> activity<00:03:15.269> has<00:03:15.720> been<00:03:15.870> rated<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.260> low

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
solar activity has been rated as low

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.979 
solar activity has been rated as low
despite<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:17.850> being<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.269> many<00:03:18.390> regions<00:03:18.870> on

despite there being so many regions on
the<00:03:19.019> Sun<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.220> mainly<00:03:20.430> because<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
the Sun this is mainly because the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.940 
the Sun this is mainly because the

where they were before I'd like to think

where they were before I'd like to think
it<00:04:05.200> was<00:04:05.320> my<00:04:05.650> complaints<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.250> they<00:04:06.370> made<00:04:06.520> a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
it was my complaints that they made a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.240 
it was my complaints that they made a
difference<00:04:06.970> but<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.150> don't<00:04:07.420> know<00:04:07.600> that

difference but I don't know that

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.780 
coronagraph data from Soho we can see
that<00:05:22.510> there<00:05:22.720> is<00:05:22.750> indeed<00:05:23.290> a<00:05:23.680> small<00:05:24.310> clone<00:05:24.580> mass

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790

ejection off the northeast limb probably

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.950 
ejection off the northeast limb probably
associated<00:05:26.980> with<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.640> fellow<00:05:27.910> interruption

however<00:05:29.770> there's<00:05:29.919> also<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.250> halo<00:05:30.610> event<00:05:30.940> it

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
however there's also a halo event it

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.240 
however there's also a halo event it
seems<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.690> be<00:05:31.750> heading<00:05:32.080> either<00:05:32.410> Street<00:05:32.800> hat<00:05:32.979> or

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
seems to be heading either Street hat or

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.129 
seems to be heading either Street hat or
straight<00:05:33.460> away<00:05:33.669> from<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.940> earth<00:05:34.000> so<00:05:34.990> we'll

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
straight away from the earth so we'll

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.050 
straight away from the earth so we'll
need<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.350> take<00:05:35.470> a<00:05:35.530> look<00:05:35.710> at<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.100> stereo<00:05:36.789> data

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
need to take a look at the stereo data

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.629 
need to take a look at the stereo data
to<00:05:37.300> see<00:05:37.479> which<00:05:37.509> way<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:37.870> was<00:05:38.139> going<00:05:38.580> for<00:05:39.580> this

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
to see which way it was going for this

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.059 
to see which way it was going for this
will<00:05:39.849> use<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.240> stereo<00:05:40.599> a<00:05:40.660> data<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.470> in<00:05:41.919> these

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
will use the stereo a data and in these

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.680 
will use the stereo a data and in these
circumstances<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.819> earth<00:05:43.060> is<00:05:43.270> on<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.479> left

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
circumstances the earth is on the left

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.870 
circumstances the earth is on the left
in<00:05:43.900> these<00:05:44.020> images<00:05:44.259> and<00:05:44.800> you<00:05:45.310> can<00:05:45.430> see<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.699> the

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
in these images and you can see that the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.670 
in these images and you can see that the
second<00:05:46.210> coronal<00:05:46.690> mass<00:05:46.810> ejection<00:05:46.840> here<00:05:47.470> is

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
second coronal mass ejection here is

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.279 
second coronal mass ejection here is
headed<00:05:48.039> basically<00:05:48.880> at<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.210> earth<00:05:49.360> it's<00:05:50.199> a

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
headed basically at the earth it's a

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.779 
headed basically at the earth it's a
relatively<00:05:50.620> slow<00:05:50.949> one<00:05:51.160> at<00:05:51.280> going<00:05:51.520> at<00:05:51.639> about

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
relatively slow one at going at about

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.420 
relatively slow one at going at about
400<00:05:52.270> kilometers<00:05:52.360> per<00:05:52.780> second<00:05:53.229> but<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.250> looks

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
400 kilometers per second but it looks

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.730 
400 kilometers per second but it looks
as<00:05:54.520> though<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.759> will<00:05:54.910> be<00:05:54.970> geo<00:05:55.270> effective<00:05:55.870> it

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
as though it will be geo effective it

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.379 
as though it will be geo effective it
will<00:05:56.830> take<00:05:57.009> two<00:05:57.220> or<00:05:57.250> three<00:05:57.370> days<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:57.880> get<00:05:58.000> here

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
will take two or three days to get here

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.150 
will take two or three days to get here
depending<00:05:59.289> on<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.440> stage<00:05:59.650> of<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.830> solar<00:06:00.039> wind

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
depending on the stage of the solar wind

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.830 
depending on the stage of the solar wind
so<00:06:00.550> we'll<00:06:00.699> take<00:06:00.849> a<00:06:00.910> look<00:06:01.090> at<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.300> ACE<00:06:01.419> data<00:06:01.690> and

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
so we'll take a look at the ACE data and

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.810 
so we'll take a look at the ACE data and
see<00:06:01.960> what's<00:06:02.139> going<00:06:02.320> on<00:06:02.500> there<00:06:02.830> temperature

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820

hour<00:06:46.120> forecast<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.990> that<00:06:47.230> CNM<00:06:48.040> fairs<00:06:48.310> are

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
hour forecast is that CNM fairs are

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.140 
hour forecast is that CNM fairs are
likely<00:06:49.230> ex-players<00:06:50.230> are<00:06:50.380> possible<00:06:51.030> so<00:06:52.030> that's

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
likely ex-players are possible so that's

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.659 
what number will remain high cme's
remain<00:06:55.300> likely<00:06:56.040> so<00:06:57.040> the<00:06:57.160> wind<00:06:57.310> speed<00:06:57.400> will

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
remain likely so the wind speed will

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.720 
remain likely so the wind speed will
drop<00:06:58.060> lower<00:06:58.360> and<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:59.610> chances<00:07:00.610> of<00:07:00.640> a
