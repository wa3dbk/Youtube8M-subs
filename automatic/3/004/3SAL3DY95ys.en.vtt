it<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> swings<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.610> angle

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it so it swings to the other angle

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
it so it swings to the other angle
other<00:01:34.110> aspect<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> buttons<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.700> buttons

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
other aspect is the buttons the buttons

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
other aspect is the buttons the buttons
on<00:01:36.090> top<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> plastic<00:01:36.689> crate<00:01:37.170> allow<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
on top of the plastic crate allow you to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
on top of the plastic crate allow you to
remove<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> top<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> peas<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.570> clean<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
remove the top of peas and to clean the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
remove the top of peas and to clean the
bottom<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> cage<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> plastic<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
bottom of the cage it is plastic so it

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
bottom of the cage it is plastic so it
is<00:01:42.060> easy<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> clean<00:01:43.310> that's<00:01:44.310> why<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> air

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is easy to clean that's why as the air

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
is easy to clean that's why as the air
vents<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:45.689> big<00:01:46.049> enough<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.380> allow

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
vents go they are big enough to allow

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.400 
cage I think the two big reasons why
people<00:02:22.700> decide<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.300> go<00:02:23.600> with<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> wire<00:02:24.050> cage

people decide to go with the wire cage

you can wipe it down and clean it pretty

quickly and insert it back into the cave
with<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:33.080> or<00:02:33.140> no<00:02:33.170> problem<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.250> our

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
with little or no problem that our

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.010 
with little or no problem that our

aspect that people usually go with the

aspect that people usually go with the
wire<00:02:36.170> cage<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.620> fact<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.280> see

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
wire cage is the fact that they can see

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.240 
wire cage is the fact that they can see
the<00:02:38.030> dog<00:02:38.240> at<00:02:38.480> any<00:02:38.630> angle<00:02:38.900> within<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> room<00:02:39.650> but<00:02:40.190> I

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the dog at any angle within a room but I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.890 
the dog at any angle within a room but I
think<00:02:40.520> when<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.700> comes<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.090> risk<00:02:41.420> versus

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
think when it comes to risk versus

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.040 
think when it comes to risk versus
reward<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.590> think<00:02:42.860> you'll<00:02:43.010> find<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:44.180> wire

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
reward I think you'll find that the wire

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.320 
reward I think you'll find that the wire
cage<00:02:45.350> accent<00:02:45.740> has<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> lot<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.250> downsides<00:02:46.760> we'll

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
cage accent has a lot of downsides we'll

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.150 
cage accent has a lot of downsides we'll
start<00:02:47.540> off<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.930> door<00:02:48.200> though<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.950> door

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
start off with the door though the door

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.400 
start off with the door though the door
is<00:02:49.280> usually<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.610> fixed<00:02:49.910> fixed<00:02:50.840> swinging<00:02:51.200> doors

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
is usually a fixed fixed swinging doors

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.560 
is usually a fixed fixed swinging doors
so<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:51.740> only<00:02:51.950> swing<00:02:52.190> from<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.400> angle<00:02:52.910> but

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
so you can only swing from one angle but

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.380 
so you can only swing from one angle but
another<00:02:54.440> bad<00:02:54.710> feature<00:02:55.010> though<00:02:55.310> when<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.210> comes

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
another bad feature though when it comes

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.910 
another bad feature though when it comes
to<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> wire<00:02:56.720> cable<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.260> fact<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.650> have

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
to the wire cable in fact you have

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
fancier because I know the the cardboard

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.170 
fancier because I know the the cardboard
box<00:04:56.140> is<00:04:56.290> not<00:04:56.440> necessarily<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.980> deal<00:04:57.580> for<00:04:57.910> as<00:04:58.030> far

box is not necessarily a deal for as far

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.760 
box is not necessarily a deal for as far
as<00:04:58.300> looks<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.140> could<00:04:59.470> get<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> little

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
as looks so you could get a little

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.470 
as looks so you could get a little
fancier<00:05:00.280> by<00:05:00.400> accident<00:05:00.790> making<00:05:01.030> something<00:05:01.270> out

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
fancier by accident making something out

of<00:05:01.510> wood<00:05:01.720> if<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:02.650> made<00:05:02.770> out<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:02.980> wood<00:05:03.130> is

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
of wood if it's made out of wood is

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.560 
of wood if it's made out of wood is
probably<00:05:03.490> gonna<00:05:03.610> be<00:05:03.700> sturdier<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.360> you<00:05:04.450> can

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
probably gonna be sturdier so you can

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.720 
probably gonna be sturdier so you can
actually<00:05:04.800> put<00:05:05.800> something<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.220> on<00:05:06.340> top<00:05:06.580> the
