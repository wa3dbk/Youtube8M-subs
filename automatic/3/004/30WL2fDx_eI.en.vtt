00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello everyone, welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.690
 romandiola today we make watercress 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 Romagna 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.730
 we did it simple then that 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.990
 mozzarella tomato base 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 the dough is the same as the piadina vi 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.789
 I put precisely the link below 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.920
 to refer you to the recipe of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.720
 piadina because it will be used precisely 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 the same dough we make here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 very short overview of the ingredients 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 then tomato oil white pepper 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 mozzarella because we will do precisely the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.420
 simple watercress then that's enough for you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.340
 cut out a piece of dough 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.190
 work it with your hands and then 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.190
 spread it with a rolling pin 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.410
 ok once you've spent well 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 the dough can be cut into two parts 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.420
 and then then fill it as 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
 you want so at your leisure in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.110
 In this case we did just the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.490
 simple recipe then with tomato and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 mozzarella cheese 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.910
 usually with a piadina it is used 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.070
 one piadina to make them watercress and 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.280
 so here we fold it in half, however 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.830
 we split it into two because we wanted to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.619
 to make the hooks smaller than 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.660
 this is usually done to taste more 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.940
 taste no because you can still do the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.369
 stuffing as you wish you can too 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.229
 put the nutella in there is the piadina 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.440
 with the nutella filling then one 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.690
 goodness and here we have now put precisely 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.110
 the mozzarella the tomato a drop 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 of oil and add a pinch of pepper 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.350
 white is at your leisure you can 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.020
 also put a pinch of oregano 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.910
 but we really like the oregano then of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.170
 usually we add it here 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.739
 passage that we are adding 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.739
 oregano 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.400
 then we close these mini watercresses 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:40.610
 we crush well at the end and with the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.159
 we press well in such a way 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.750
 that they don't open because otherwise it's easy 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:51.250
 that the tomato comes out ee therefore in short 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.930
 to make cooking easier 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.410
 tap with the fork on one side 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.410
 and on the other 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.340
 ok here we are again on ours 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.140
 plate and supporting ours 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.000
 watercress the plate obviously must 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.350
 be hot because cooking must 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.150
 be fast enough here and on which 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.900
 we put our two watercresses in 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.900
 cook 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.150
 the filling at your leisure can 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.160
 put what you want so you can 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.220
 put also mozzarella tomato and 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.349
 Mashed boiled potatoes you can put on 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.870
 nutella whatever they are 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.510
 very good the recipe is very simple 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.030
 as you have seen besides making piadina 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.160
 we usually also make watercresses 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.190
 we make them so little to have the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.019
 possibility to taste more busts 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.820
 otherwise the big watercress there 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.290
 I guarantee that once you eat that 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.270
 you are full of fills a lot here behold 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.919
 here the final result you see here the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.750
 big watercress that would be its own 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.270
 the half-moon one and the others 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.650
 little crescentini good appetite vi 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 greeting to the next of Italy
