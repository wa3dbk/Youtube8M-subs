00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 Y 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:21.769
 in fact I think that because of this I can not go 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.119
 the point is on the right 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.039
 of the 20 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:46.239
 up 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.239
 like the water 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:59.210
 for do 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.210
 carries out 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.210
 tur 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.360
 you have to do god 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 to these races where the station by 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.900
 the landfill 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.890
 despite this 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:25.610
 to such a point uncle is an unknown 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.610
 you have to clear it and added what was sent 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.520
 must be done now 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.080
 what does 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.160
 good 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 that played the guardrail but good to me not 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.560
 will see me is enough to know the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.930
 rubin I for a style is worth here for 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 the looping makes a loop and maxwell is worth 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.470
 ok I do not see it 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.470
 I came out uncle came out 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.990
 trying to arrive without doing it but that 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 under the pig that does not arrive 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.680
 s 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.750
 It's worth it, I have to change it 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.900
 if you put the animation and do not know where 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 is 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.560
 to the minimum 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.380
 one 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:20.980
 come back serious are not two guys 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.980
 but you have 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.950
 the first can pass all 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:39.510
 I do not think uncle I have my man that 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.510
 He says 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.570
 tampa or the past 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.390
 but I 'm on the second 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.890
 perfection 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.230
 which has been the carotid 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.080
 I did not catch it god 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.340

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 to you equal 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.390
 and more 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.780
 worth the point we are 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.870
