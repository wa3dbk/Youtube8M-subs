00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.700 

now<00:00:44.510> those<00:00:44.720> are<00:00:44.750> slightly<00:00:45.140> different<00:00:45.350> once

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
now those are slightly different once

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.710 
now those are slightly different once
they<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.910> slightly<00:00:47.090> different<00:00:47.210> kind<00:00:47.690> of

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
they have slightly different kind of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.110 
they have slightly different kind of
outputs<00:00:48.110> you<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:49.370> based<00:00:49.640> different

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
outputs you so is it based different

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.780 
outputs you so is it based different
tubes<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.809> whole<00:00:51.290> full<00:00:51.470> spikes<00:00:51.770> level<00:00:52.129> 6<00:00:52.460> eb

six of them okay but other than that

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.799 
six of them okay but other than that
they're<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.280> same<00:00:55.460> as<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.000> see<00:00:56.210> I'm<00:00:56.360> one<00:00:56.540> the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
with a pair of Perlman TM ones it's a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.770 
with a pair of Perlman TM ones it's a
pretty<00:01:09.800> bright<00:01:10.250> aggressive<00:01:10.940> piano<00:01:11.210> very<00:01:11.479> rock

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
pretty bright aggressive piano very rock

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.719 
pretty bright aggressive piano very rock
and<00:01:11.810> roll<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:12.830> since<00:01:13.009> we're<00:01:13.430> going<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.610> be

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729

recording<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.210> little<00:01:14.450> more<00:01:14.570> jazz<00:01:14.840> style<00:01:15.200> I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
recording a little more jazz style I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.800 
recording a little more jazz style I
wanted<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.070> make<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.220> mic<00:01:16.520> choice<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.210> even<00:01:17.780> a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
wanted to make a mic choice and even a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.510 
wanted to make a mic choice and even a
little<00:01:17.899> bit<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.229> pre<00:01:18.590> amp<00:01:18.710> aneeq<00:01:19.070> choice<00:01:19.310> to

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
little bit of pre amp aneeq choice to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.490 
little bit of pre amp aneeq choice to
help<00:01:19.700> soften<00:01:20.539> it<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.869> warm<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.170> up<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.350> little

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
help soften it and warm it up a little

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.840 
help soften it and warm it up a little
bit<00:01:21.680> since<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.160> going<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.369> be<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.759> a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
bit since this is going to be just a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.499 
bit since this is going to be just a
solo<00:01:23.060> piano<00:01:23.390> track<00:01:23.770> I've<00:01:24.770> used<00:01:25.039> the

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
solo piano track I've used the

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.700 
solo piano track I've used the
Pacifica's<00:01:26.509> with<00:01:26.660> a<00:01:26.720> pad<00:01:26.899> switch<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.350> again<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
Pacifica's with a pad switch in again to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.380 
Pacifica's with a pad switch in again to
enhance<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.250> little<00:01:28.490> bit<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.670> low<00:01:28.940> end<00:01:29.180> and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
enhance a little bit of that low end and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.010 
enhance a little bit of that low end and
then<00:01:29.990> I've<00:01:30.140> run<00:01:30.380> into<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.950> pair<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.479> EMP

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
then I've run into a pair of the EMP

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.100 
then I've run into a pair of the EMP
eq's<00:01:33.550> not<00:01:34.550> really<00:01:34.789> for<00:01:34.940> corrective<00:01:35.420> eq<00:01:35.780> but

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
eq's not really for corrective eq but

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.330 
eq's not really for corrective eq but
just<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.500> add<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> little<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
just to add a little of the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.859 
just to add a little of the
characteristic<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.149> that<00:01:38.300> eq<00:01:38.600> I've<00:01:38.690> done<00:01:38.840> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
characteristic of that eq I've done a

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.389 
characteristic of that eq I've done a
little<00:01:39.050> boost<00:01:39.259> around<00:01:39.590> 60<00:01:39.979> Hertz<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.310> a

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
little boost around 60 Hertz and a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.990 
little boost around 60 Hertz and a
little<00:01:40.700> boost<00:01:40.990> around<00:01:42.160> 10k<00:01:43.160> not<00:01:43.550> much<00:01:43.820> but

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
little boost around 10k not much but

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.100 
little boost around 10k not much but
just<00:01:44.060> enough<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.600> add<00:01:44.750> some<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.080> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
just enough to add some of that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.010 
just enough to add some of that
character<00:01:45.470> because<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:47.330> eq<00:01:47.750> will<00:01:47.869> make

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
character because that that eq will make

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.060 
character because that that eq will make
things<00:01:48.140> sound<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.439> little<00:01:48.619> bigger<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.009> little

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
things sound a little bigger a little

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.300 
things sound a little bigger a little
warmer<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.790> also<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.780> little<00:01:51.100> more<00:01:52.100> aggressive

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
warmer and also a little more aggressive

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.820 
warmer and also a little more aggressive
at<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.700> top<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:53.360> those<00:01:53.600> high<00:01:54.290> notes<00:01:54.350> will<00:01:54.680> cut

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
at the top so those high notes will cut

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.789 
at the top so those high notes will cut
through<00:01:54.979> as<00:01:55.220> well<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:56.320> that's<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.470> straight

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
through as well and that's it straight

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:47.670 
through as well and that's it straight
into<00:01:57.920> Pro<00:01:58.070> Tools<00:01:58.100> after<00:01:58.520> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:03:38.670 

you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.739 

you
