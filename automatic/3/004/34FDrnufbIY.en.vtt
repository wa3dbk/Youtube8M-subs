00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.490
 ready to sherbrooke when i got 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.739
 woke that there quietly my 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.649
 parents tell me that this text 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:27.599
 it was pretty bad what I had 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:29.669
 I wanted to avoid a klai hole had a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.309
 car that relays rolling stick on me 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.219
 then to hit me 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.429
 then after that is to hit me by in 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.750
 back but I went this morning and has 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.510
 hit in his windshield 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.499
 it's like flying over the car 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.499
 falls back from the car 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.239
 because he's watching me in a coma 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.700
 artificial and first three days I 'll 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.150
 was doing intensive then he was like 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.070
 post 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.199
 some of the damage they had been 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.460
 caused to the brain then the one she 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.620
 like operated on the brain does it 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.690
 preferred that I be aware for 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.490
 closed from 6 to face that is - country but the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.240
 first first week I remember 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.190
 of nothing then when I woke up 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.740
 I was hemiplegic left could 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.619
 more moving then saw that doctors that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.170
 pass some of simonet stamos and 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.670
 I was able to eat properly 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.370
 I you look at 20 o'clock I can 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.730
 not drink water 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.130
 but because but firstly at 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.390
 early I was no longer able to walk 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 small stock we learn to walk we are 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.070
 small we are not aware of source 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.280
 it goes alone we get up on sea but 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.790
 there at 23h and learn to walk our 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.040
 gains the offer was conscious and that's 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.650
 you who decides what you start or 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.720
 what are you going to do 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.430
 I understood our life as more time 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.110
 where loeb is frustrating because you 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.260
 knew that at the beginning yes I was walking with 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.090
 the fake about how to poor countries 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.790
 this bull sometimes it's hard on the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.880
 tastes now then it's the same 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.750
 thing here with just the memory was 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.490
 also affected to remember no it takes 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.690
 new stuff there when I get to 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.540
 a new place all people this 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.240
 hello hello hello yes ok it's good 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.920
 I was silent the name jean reminded me with 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.130
 middle but after I'm going to revisit the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.820
 nobody I remember speed of 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.959
 information processing like that 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.730
 I need a little more 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.100
 concentration the career too brutal 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.800
 or too many people who talk to me at the same 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.150
 time to be able to handle like the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.060
 even the same way as down and then I 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.110
 am tired a bit more if he was 20 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.110
 I could go to bed late 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.370
 it can see easy 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.930
 for sure I know that everything is 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.990
 quirky I would like to have a house 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.170
 instead of being autonomous to do everything 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.670
 first raid ever and I did not delay you 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.430
 because of that and thank you paul I 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.530
 take things from day to day 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.740
 I'm adapting to things that 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.740
 arrive
