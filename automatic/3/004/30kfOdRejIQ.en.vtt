like you just kind of accept the common

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
like you just kind of accept the common
when<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> happens<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:18.659> set<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
as long as you don't drop it it's just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
as long as you don't drop it it's just
like<00:01:20.700> half<00:01:20.939> your<00:01:20.970> health<00:01:21.180> bar<00:01:21.360> gone<00:01:21.570> yeah
