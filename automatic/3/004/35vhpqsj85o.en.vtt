00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
here we got the phases and the turn
order<00:02:19.320> phases<00:02:19.800> are<00:02:19.830> exactly<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> same<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
order phases are exactly the same so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.730 
order phases are exactly the same so
let's<00:02:21.750> bring<00:02:21.930> me<00:02:22.200> okay<00:02:22.770> now<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:24.740> don't

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
oh wait we do get a code card i think

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
oh wait we do get a code card i think
i'm<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:52.709> sure<00:02:52.890> anyways<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.430> King<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:53.880> us

not allowed to use a code card which is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.729 
not allowed to use a code card which is
a<00:03:20.880> shame<00:03:21.170> anyways<00:03:22.170> that's<00:03:22.320> for<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> other

very<00:07:14.980> very<00:07:15.070> nice<00:07:16.080> also<00:07:17.080> these<00:07:17.200> cards<00:07:17.530> are<00:07:17.620> a

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
very very nice also these cards are a

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.130 
very very nice also these cards are a
lot<00:07:17.920> thinner<00:07:18.370> than<00:07:18.700> the<00:07:19.240> original<00:07:19.570> cards<00:07:19.930> I

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
lot thinner than the original cards I

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.840 
lot thinner than the original cards I
suggest<00:07:20.740> to<00:07:20.830> be<00:07:20.950> kind<00:07:21.160> of<00:07:21.250> careful<00:07:21.400> with<00:07:21.700> these

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
suggest to be kind of careful with these

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.460 
suggest to be kind of careful with these
because<00:07:22.800> they<00:07:23.800> could<00:07:23.950> bend<00:07:24.130> quite<00:07:24.400> easily<00:07:24.580> so

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
because they could bend quite easily so

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.290 
because they could bend quite easily so
be<00:07:26.470> sure<00:07:26.500> to<00:07:26.650> get<00:07:26.860> some<00:07:26.920> sleeves<00:07:27.400> and<00:07:27.790> protect

be sure to get some sleeves and protect
your<00:07:28.420> cards<00:07:28.780> because<00:07:28.930> the<00:07:29.290> you<00:07:30.160> don't<00:07:30.280> want<00:07:30.400> to
