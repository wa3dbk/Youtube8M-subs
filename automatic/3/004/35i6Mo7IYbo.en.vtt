I've left her in a room where I'm not

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.060 
I've left her in a room where I'm not
basically<00:01:18.750> I'll<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> dog<00:01:19.680> gate

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
basically I'll put up like the dog gate

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.039 
basically I'll put up like the dog gate
because<00:01:20.250> we've<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:20.720> painters<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
because we've had painters and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
because we've had painters and
electricians<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> flooring<00:01:23.369> guys<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
electricians and flooring guys in and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
electricians and flooring guys in and
out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> house<00:01:24.360> which<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> best

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
out of the house which is not the best

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.960 
out of the house which is not the best
thing<00:01:26.130> either<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.759> probably

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
thing either because it's probably

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.670 
thing either because it's probably
confusing<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> hell<00:01:27.689> out<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> her<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
confusing the hell out of her which is

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
confusing the hell out of her which is
only<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> year<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.390> can't<00:01:30.780> blame

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
only a year so you know I can't blame

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
only a year so you know I can't blame
her<00:01:32.009> too<00:01:32.220> much<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.540> she's<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
her too much but it's like she's got a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.280 
her too much but it's like she's got a
little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.270> separation<00:01:36.270> anxiety<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
little bit of separation anxiety when I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit of separation anxiety when I
put<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> gate<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> I'm<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> same

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
put up the gate and I'm not in the same

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
put up the gate and I'm not in the same
room<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.240> she<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.710> other<00:01:40.860> than<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
room that she is but other than that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.600 
room that she is but other than that
she's<00:01:41.400> been<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:42.049> she's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.610> enjoying

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
she's been pretty good she's a enjoying

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.080 
she's been pretty good she's a enjoying
the<00:01:45.170> betrayal<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.829> she<00:01:47.670> wasn't<00:01:47.880> able

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the betrayal right now she wasn't able

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.020 
the betrayal right now she wasn't able
to<00:01:48.619> do<00:01:49.619> too<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.670> two<00:01:51.000> weeks

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to do too much the first two weeks

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.240 
to do too much the first two weeks
because<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.880> rule<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
because here they have a rule that you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
because here they have a rule that you
can't<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.020> animal<00:01:58.020> from<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> shelter

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
can't take a animal from the shelter

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.139 
can't take a animal from the shelter
unless<00:01:59.159> they've<00:01:59.430> been<00:01:59.640> spayed<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.000> neutered

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
unless they've been spayed or neutered

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.450 
unless they've been spayed or neutered
which<00:02:00.630> makes<00:02:01.079> sense<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> she<00:02:02.610> had<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
which makes sense so she had to get that

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.880 
which makes sense so she had to get that
done<00:02:05.460> before<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.719> could<00:02:07.170> take<00:02:07.320> her<00:02:07.469> home<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
done before I could take her home and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.339 
done before I could take her home and
obviously<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.239> 10<00:02:09.539> days<00:02:09.569> she<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.140> kind

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
obviously for like 10 days she was kind

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.130 
obviously for like 10 days she was kind
of<00:02:10.410> slow<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.709> still<00:02:11.700> groggy<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.270> now

when she's okay apparently her name is
Danny<00:02:55.040> by<00:02:56.040> walking<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
Danny by walking to the one on the

ground and she walked to Luna so double

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
ground and she walked to Luna so double
coincidence<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:01.110> guess<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.590> also<00:03:02.250> liked<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
coincidence I guess I also liked the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.030 
coincidence I guess I also liked the
name<00:03:03.110> Rosa<00:03:04.110> barks<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:06.269> imagine<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
name Rosa barks but I could imagine the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.290 
name Rosa barks but I could imagine the
response<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.459> reaction<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.030> would<00:03:09.120> get

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
response and a reaction you would get

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.040 
response and a reaction you would get
when<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.630> took<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:10.340> canine<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.610> vet<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
when you took your canine to the vet and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.070 
when you took your canine to the vet and
told<00:03:13.050> them<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:14.150> her<00:03:15.150> name<00:03:15.300> was<00:03:15.360> Rosa<00:03:15.720> Parks

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
told them that her name was Rosa Parks

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.900 
told them that her name was Rosa Parks
