00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.300
 even the g20 week at afp rose in 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.700
 I think people would use more or less 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.160
 see the date three weeks ago we have 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.770
 between 25 seconds ana to gain time 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.140
 the last and the temperature of the track 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.120
 I was very nervous but we will have 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 now a little closer 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.920
 games either train them true 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.259
 we need in the urn objectives and fulfilled 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 the four national carts in 4 between 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.570
 the different and I think it should not 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.380
 be enabled and we should not 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.380
 mistakes
