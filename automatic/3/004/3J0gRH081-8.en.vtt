00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.850 

well<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.629> know<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:37.780> think<00:00:37.960> when<00:00:38.289> we<00:00:38.379> first

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
well you know I think when we first

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.860 
well you know I think when we first
started<00:00:39.309> down<00:00:39.489> this<00:00:39.730> path<00:00:39.789> we<00:00:40.329> were<00:00:40.480> looking

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
started down this path we were looking

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.979 
started down this path we were looking
at<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:42.280> looking<00:00:42.489> at<00:00:42.730> engagement<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.930> of

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
at really looking at engagement one of

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.990 
at really looking at engagement one of
the<00:00:44.079> things<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.379> we<00:00:44.620> saw<00:00:44.890> was<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.760> know<00:00:45.879> we

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
the things that we saw was you know we

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.540 
the things that we saw was you know we
have<00:00:46.149> a<00:00:46.180> large<00:00:46.510> large<00:00:47.320> proportion<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.190> kids

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
have a large large proportion of kids

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.900 
have a large large proportion of kids
who<00:00:49.000> struggle<00:00:49.510> with<00:00:49.780> reading<00:00:50.640> yet<00:00:51.640> when<00:00:51.879> you

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
who struggle with reading yet when you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.139 
who struggle with reading yet when you
look<00:00:52.000> at<00:00:52.329> their<00:00:52.710> IQs<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:53.739> cognitive<00:00:54.489> ability

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
look at their IQs and cognitive ability

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.000 
look at their IQs and cognitive ability
we<00:00:55.690> should<00:00:55.899> only<00:00:55.989> have<00:00:56.260> one<00:00:56.470> or<00:00:56.589> two<00:00:56.769> that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
we should only have one or two that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.380 
we should only have one or two that
struggle<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.390> why<00:00:59.170> are<00:00:59.229> they<00:00:59.409> disengaged

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
struggle and so why are they disengaged

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.119 
struggle and so why are they disengaged
why<00:01:01.390> are<00:01:01.510> they<00:01:01.750> hating<00:01:02.110> coming<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.559> school<00:01:02.860> and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
why are they hating coming to school and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.369 
why are they hating coming to school and
so<00:01:03.610> that's<00:01:04.000> really<00:01:04.509> where<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:04.780> started<00:01:05.199> down

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
so that's really where we started down

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.889 
so that's really where we started down
the<00:01:05.530> technology<00:01:06.190> path<00:01:06.460> was<00:01:06.790> just<00:01:07.090> engagement

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
the technology path was just engagement

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.320 
the technology path was just engagement
kids<00:01:08.350> have<00:01:08.679> these<00:01:08.950> technology<00:01:09.580> tools<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:10.060> home

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
kids have these technology tools at home

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.270 
kids have these technology tools at home
they<00:01:11.050> have<00:01:11.200> them<00:01:11.350> in<00:01:11.380> her<00:01:11.590> pocket<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.130> the

to school and we were asking them to

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.380 
to school and we were asking them to
power<00:01:16.420> down<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:17.020> kind<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.470> disengage<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.399> so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
power down and kind of disengage and so

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.290 
power down and kind of disengage and so
that<00:01:19.600> really<00:01:19.960> kind<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.500> sparked<00:01:20.920> us<00:01:21.130> know<00:01:22.090> what

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
that really kind of sparked us know what

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.870 
that really kind of sparked us know what
can<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:22.539> do<00:01:22.690> with<00:01:22.780> these<00:01:22.960> devices<00:01:23.550> how<00:01:24.550> can<00:01:24.789> we

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
can we do with these devices how can we

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.540 
can we do with these devices how can we
utilize<00:01:25.060> them<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.570> class<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:27.070> kind<00:01:27.490> of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
utilize them in class and kind of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.970 
utilize them in class and kind of
relooking<00:01:28.090> at<00:01:28.119> technology<00:01:28.899> that<00:01:29.110> way

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.330 

I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.760> it's<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.150> portability<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.920> iPad

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
I think it's the portability of the iPad

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.560 
I think it's the portability of the iPad
that's<00:01:38.580> important<00:01:40.040> one<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.730> advantages

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's important one of the advantages

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
that's important one of the advantages
of<00:01:43.050> being<00:01:43.260> able<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.590> walk<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> room<00:01:44.130> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
of being able to walk around the room is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.930 
of being able to walk around the room is
monitoring<00:01:45.330> engagement<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.980> classroom

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
monitoring engagement and just classroom

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.150 
monitoring engagement and just classroom
management<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.870> can't<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.440> in<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.740> place<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
management you can't be in one place and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.770 
management you can't be in one place and

want<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.800> step<00:02:11.010> up<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.820> then<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.600> can<00:02:13.170> get

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to step up so then you can get

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.050 
want to step up so then you can get
students<00:02:13.980> who<00:02:14.040> typically<00:02:14.370> would<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.640> Wiggly

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
students who typically would be Wiggly

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
students who typically would be Wiggly
and<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.360> engaged<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:16.680> more<00:02:16.890> engaged<00:02:17.190> with

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and not engaged way more engaged with

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
and not engaged way more engaged with
those<00:02:17.550> tools<00:02:17.790> yeah<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.410> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
those tools yeah so we you know it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.410 
those tools yeah so we you know it's
funny<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.430> were<00:02:20.550> doing<00:02:20.580> flip<00:02:21.150> before

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
funny I think we were doing flip before

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.260 
funny I think we were doing flip before
flip<00:02:22.320> became<00:02:22.740> popular<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.610> know<00:02:23.760> teacher

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
flip became popular you know teacher

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.680 
flip became popular you know teacher
started<00:02:25.520> pre-recording<00:02:26.520> because<00:02:27.360> there's<00:02:27.540> no

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
started pre-recording because there's no

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.240 
started pre-recording because there's no
content<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.350> any<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.680> these<00:02:28.770> industry

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
content in any of these industry

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.010 
content in any of these industry
standard<00:02:29.670> program<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> teacher<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:32.040> got

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
standard program so the teacher we got

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.200 
standard program so the teacher we got
we<00:02:34.020> got<00:02:34.050> screen<00:02:34.620> capture<00:02:34.980> software<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
we got screen capture software and the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
we got screen capture software and the
teachers<00:02:36.570> came<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> projects<00:02:37.950> they

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
teachers came up with the projects they

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980 
teachers came up with the projects they
wanted<00:02:38.340> their<00:02:38.460> kids<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:39.870> they

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
wanted their kids to do and then they

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.980 
wanted their kids to do and then they
film<00:02:40.350> themselves<00:02:40.650> actually<00:02:41.810> creating<00:02:42.810> those

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
film themselves actually creating those

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.949 
film themselves actually creating those
projects<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.800> broke<00:02:44.010> them<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.310> into<00:02:44.520> steps

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
projects and broke them up into steps

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.330 
projects and broke them up into steps
except<00:02:45.959> we're<00:02:46.140> doing<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.530> different<00:02:46.920> we've

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
except we're doing it different we've

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
except we're doing it different we've
tried<00:02:47.700> some<00:02:48.000> flip<00:02:48.270> model<00:02:48.480> where<00:02:48.990> we<00:02:49.020> create

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
tried some flip model where we create

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.380 
tried some flip model where we create
the<00:02:49.980> videos<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:50.610> expect<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> kids<00:02:51.300> to

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the videos and we expect the kids to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
the videos and we expect the kids to
watch<00:02:51.660> them<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:51.989> home<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.340> we're<00:02:53.550> not

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
watch them at home but because we're not

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.250 
watch them at home but because we're not
in<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.970> true<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.570> one<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.810> we're<00:02:55.080> not

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
in a true one to one and we're not

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.520 
in a true one to one and we're not
providing<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.040> device<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:57.690> weren't<00:02:57.930> seeing<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
providing the device we weren't seeing a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
providing the device we weren't seeing a
huge<00:02:58.680> participation<00:02:59.520> in<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.209> where

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
huge participation in that so where

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.260 
huge participation in that so where
we've<00:03:00.750> kind<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.110> modified<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.980> flip<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.550> we're

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
we've kind of modified the flip is we're

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.479 
we've kind of modified the flip is we're
doing<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.600> all<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.750> class<00:03:04.170> they're<00:03:05.070> watching

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
doing it all in class they're watching

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.460 
doing it all in class they're watching
the<00:03:05.610> video<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:05.910> doing<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> project<00:03:07.020> or<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the video and doing the project or the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.680 
the video and doing the project or the
working<00:03:07.950> class<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.640> then<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> teacher<00:03:09.120> truly

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
working class and then the teacher truly

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.010 
working class and then the teacher truly
is<00:03:09.810> free<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.560> more<00:03:11.430> facilitate<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.480> still

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
is free to more facilitate so I still

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.810 
is free to more facilitate so I still
think<00:03:13.290> that's<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.590> version<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:14.130> flip<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.640> just

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
think that's a version of flip is just

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.380 
think that's a version of flip is just
kind<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.090> our<00:03:15.470> modification<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.650> it

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.020 

because<00:03:23.020> we<00:03:23.230> can<00:03:23.590> do<00:03:24.460> cross<00:03:24.790> curricular

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
because we can do cross curricular

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.420 
because we can do cross curricular
activities<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.050> have<00:03:26.080> tons<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> technology

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
activities we have tons of technology

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.770 
activities we have tons of technology
that<00:03:27.459> allows<00:03:27.790> us<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.270> small<00:03:28.600> group

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
that allows us to do small group

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.210 
that allows us to do small group
instruction<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.590> whole<00:03:29.860> group<00:03:30.069> instruction

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
instruction and whole group instruction

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.850 
instruction and whole group instruction
where<00:03:30.790> they're<00:03:30.940> able<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.440> work<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.590> their<00:03:32.709> own

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
where they're able to work on their own

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.890 
where they're able to work on their own
they<00:03:33.040> can<00:03:33.220> publish<00:03:33.550> their<00:03:33.730> own<00:03:33.850> work<00:03:34.120> they<00:03:34.600> can

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
they can publish their own work they can

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.050 
they can publish their own work they can
upload<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.830> Moodle<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:36.310> other<00:03:36.459> students<00:03:36.910> can

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
upload to Moodle so other students can

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.540 
upload to Moodle so other students can
see<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.510> home<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.130> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
see it at home and it's just the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.120 
see it at home and it's just the
technologies<00:03:40.120> awesome<00:03:40.540> i<00:03:40.750> will<00:03:41.320> use<00:03:41.530> tab<00:03:41.830> cam

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
technologies awesome i will use tab cam

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.699 
technologies awesome i will use tab cam
i'll<00:03:42.820> set<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.120> up<00:03:43.270> on<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.510> desk<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.050> I'll<00:03:44.470> do

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
i'll set it up on the desk and I'll do

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.470 
i'll set it up on the desk and I'll do
what<00:03:45.160> I'm<00:03:45.280> teaching<00:03:45.550> put<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> lesson<00:03:46.450> there

what I'm teaching put the lesson there

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.330 
what I'm teaching put the lesson there
if<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.959> worksheet<00:03:47.380> I'll<00:03:47.830> let<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.130> kids

if it's a worksheet I'll let the kids

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.070 
if it's a worksheet I'll let the kids
write<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.330> sometimes<00:03:49.600> they'll<00:03:49.900> take

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
write it on it sometimes they'll take

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.750 
write it on it sometimes they'll take
the<00:03:50.230> tab<00:03:50.440> p.m.<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.980> where<00:03:51.400> they're<00:03:51.640> working
