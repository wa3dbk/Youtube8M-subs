00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi girls in this victims do it 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.160
 with you so I will show both the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.810
 tutorial of the makeup I wear that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 also the useful and I am in my opinion 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.990
 both very vate this period 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.940
 because they are very colorful and very 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 spring and nothing I hope very much 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.870
 in this video you like it then vi 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.870
 I leave the tutorial and hello outfit 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.179
 let's start with the trick for one more thing 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.009
 than a foundation with a flat brush 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.259
 and I pat him and the areas where 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.939
 more imperfections then the cheeks and 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.309
 after which I spread it in the rest 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.930
 of the face to cover the glasses 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.309
 I use this concealer and the hostel 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.960
 those fingers because I find it a lot 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.550
 more covering is also easier to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.170
 spend with your fingers then first 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.640
 leaving those fingers and then smoking with 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.110
 a brush to fix the makeup 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.030
 I use this product which is a lot 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.649
 particular practically a way of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.449
 halfway between a timer and a powder and a 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.920
 powdered primer which serves as a 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.780
 mortify makeup and hulk a 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.399
 hide the pores and practically underneath 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.980
 there is the small brush then picked up 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.530
 the cpa below is the nib and they are 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 on all my warning about the eyes opened 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.710
 with primer to make the makeup last 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.050
 longer and even reflections 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.119
 inside after that I take this 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.200
 brownish and the obligation in the fold with 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.200
 a gradient brush 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.049
 with a brown pencil draws a line 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.049
 under the lower lashes 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.200
 and then smudge it with a pencil brush the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.700
 second color understood this that is 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 always a mormon but with a tip in it 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.780
 more than plum and I apply it over the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.590
 pencil and previously applied and then 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.590
 even in the fold 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.799
 in the inner African corner today 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.359
 on the very clear water that I think gives 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.450
 that extra touch of color without 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.429
 make excessive makeup for 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.439
 intensify it I apply this pencil 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.119
 in the corner the inside and then above always 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.810
 us for the same little pen 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.810
 eyeshadow from before 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 I apply her blue laimer and I find that blue 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.690
 gets married very well to Brown 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.200
 because it manages to make them even more 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.200
 intense 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.370
 at this point it passes to the eyebrows e 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.019
 begins by filling them with a pencil and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.519
 then the pencil around the other 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.500
 side and that is practically a brush 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.310
 to comb them then first fill them and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.310
 then comb them 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.580
 as usual I bend my eyelashes e 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.410
 others with mascara with modine in the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.540
 things like on the cheekbones this attic 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.080
 blog is very bright and perfect second 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.000
 me for this spring season e 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.750
 finally I finish the trick with this beautiful 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.520
 fuchsia lipstick on and now we pass 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080
 to the outfit I wear this is the blue site 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.670
 what reference to the blue that used on 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.080
 eyes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.730
 as you can see a visit without 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.410
 sleeves that tightens invites then 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.180
 adherent in the upper part of the body 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.010
 and then it falls to wheel to this one 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 necklace when the blue water beads 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.760
 which also recall the color that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 I used on the eyes is that of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 these silver sandals 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.930

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.460
