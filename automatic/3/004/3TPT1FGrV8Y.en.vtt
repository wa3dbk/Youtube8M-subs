00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.110

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.810
 of the best and most popular game of the genre 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.810
 of massive multiplayer online or better 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.390
 known as m / mo however it seems 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.490
 that is no longer the case in recent months 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.159
 game has been losing amounts 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.459

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.459

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.620

 important releases of this class 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.950
 of games that little by little will be a 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.990
 tough competition for world of warcraft 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.150
 and although they can now deny that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.430
 find in a crisis that is very 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.100

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.609
 to the winners and well the question 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.099
 last Tuesday's gamer was this 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.739
 ask what is the most epic scene that 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.450
 have you seen in a video game and you guys 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.450
 they responded on twitter 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.390
 the machines have always been 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.580
 characterized by at some point in the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.430
 traditional story to the human being and in 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.200
 jairo there was no exception however 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 we have seen this stereotype repeated in 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.269
 several occasions in many videogames 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.849
 the clearest example can be portal 2 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.530
 where the kind and gentle robot will 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.209
 becomes the villain and also I 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.370
 they answered here below in the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.810
 comments there is no doubt that one of the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.389
 scenes that marked life for 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.510
 some players was the scene where the 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.570
 link releases the sword in the temple of 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.030
 time in the ok nov time is simply 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.030

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.370
 blue temple 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.600

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.580

 keep changing be open to all 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.350
 the possibilities of content because if 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.810
 you close in one genre 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.180
 they will never be able to see things 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.830
