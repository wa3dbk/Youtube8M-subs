treatment cream or whatever eventually
at<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.520> beginning<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.659> lost<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.020> way

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
at the beginning because I lost my way

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
at the beginning because I lost my way
it<00:01:43.259> really<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.710> fast<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it really really fast so at the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.530 
it really really fast so at the
beginning<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.350> obvious<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
beginning it was really obvious is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
beginning it was really obvious is
really<00:01:48.540> pronounced<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.560> saggy<00:01:49.890> skin<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
really pronounced like saggy skin and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
really pronounced like saggy skin and
the<00:01:50.780> stretch<00:01:51.780> marks<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.970> once<00:01:53.970> you've<00:01:54.270> been<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the stretch marks but once you've been a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.950 
the stretch marks but once you've been a
smaller<00:01:55.290> size<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:56.009> while<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.719> back

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
smaller size for a while it will go back

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.480 
smaller size for a while it will go back
to<00:01:59.630> how<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> say<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
to how do I say it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
to how do I say it
it<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.659> guess<00:02:04.020> eventually<00:02:04.200> adapt<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> your

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it will I guess eventually adapt to your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 
it will I guess eventually adapt to your
body<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> stretch<00:02:06.750> marks<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.170> fade

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
body and the stretch marks will fade

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
body and the stretch marks will fade
away<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.789> know<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:08.940> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
away you know I don't know if it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
away you know I don't know if it's
because<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> sunlight<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.950> eventually<00:02:11.610> I
