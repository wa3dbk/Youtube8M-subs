00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
there's a little more Lane conditioner
in<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> ball<00:01:50.820> went<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.329> her

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
in there and the ball went right on her

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
in there and the ball went right on her
now<00:01:52.140> she's<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> move<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.310> bit

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
now she's got to move just a little bit

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
now she's got to move just a little bit
to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> left<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.479> board<00:01:54.780> move<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.530> she'll

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to the left one board move and she'll

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.280 
to the left one board move and she'll
slide<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> five<00:01:56.430> over<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> seven<00:01:57.600> she's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
slide the five over into the seven she's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.270 
slide the five over into the seven she's
so<00:01:58.469> accurate<00:01:58.890> she's<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> door

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280

pepper in the game with windy striking

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.419 
pepper in the game with windy striking
like<00:02:05.570> she<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:05.960> needed<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.590> make<00:02:06.710> sure<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.280> she

chance that I'm going to jump out a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.250 
chance that I'm going to jump out a
little<00:02:16.340> bit<00:02:16.489> more<00:02:16.700> patti-anne<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.930> strike

little bit more patti-anne can strike

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.550 
little bit more patti-anne can strike
here<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> back<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.940> 24<00:02:20.540> pin<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
here get it back to about 24 pin and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.550 
here get it back to about 24 pin and
we'll<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> match<00:02:22.750> she's<00:02:23.750> down<00:02:23.930> 22<00:02:24.379> at<00:02:24.470> the

bad cuz she has struck crystal get it
within<00:02:35.180> 22<00:02:35.870> pins<00:02:36.140> her<00:02:36.650> she<00:02:36.950> was<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
within 22 pins her she was that and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.140 
within 22 pins her she was that and
again<00:02:38.000> put<00:02:38.599> some<00:02:38.810> pressure<00:02:39.230> back<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.190> wendy

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
again put some pressure back on to wendy

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.839 
again put some pressure back on to wendy
again<00:02:41.840> patty<00:02:42.140> she<00:02:42.470> stays<00:02:42.709> down<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.220> time<00:02:43.519> she

gets the ball a little bit to the right

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.080 
gets the ball a little bit to the right
area<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.129> ball<00:02:46.310> track<00:02:46.610> where<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.879> ball

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
area in the ball track where the ball

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.030 
area in the ball track where the ball
will<00:02:47.209> hook<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.510> little<00:02:47.629> bit<00:02:47.840> more<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.500> again

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
will hook a little bit more and again

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.039 
will hook a little bit more and again
she<00:02:49.220> makes<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.519> very<00:02:49.700> solid<00:02:50.239> shot<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.780> every

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
she makes a very solid shot and every

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.990 
she makes a very solid shot and every
shot<00:02:51.260> she<00:02:51.470> makes<00:02:51.680> very<00:02:51.920> solid<00:02:54.610> when<00:02:55.610> he's<00:02:55.819> had

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
shot she makes very solid when he's had

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.640 
shot she makes very solid when he's had
an<00:02:56.120> open<00:02:56.420> let's<00:02:56.629> see<00:02:56.750> how<00:02:56.930> she<00:02:56.989> handles<00:02:57.290> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
an open let's see how she handles it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.309 
an open let's see how she handles it
after<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> open<00:02:58.459> patti-anne<00:02:59.299> should<00:03:00.200> have

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
after the open patti-anne should have

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.229 
after the open patti-anne should have
had<00:03:00.470> an<00:03:00.620> open<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.220> able<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.610> manage<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.060> make

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
had an open was able to manage to make

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.460 
had an open was able to manage to make
the<00:03:02.390> spare<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.930> tough<00:03:03.200> shot<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:06.109> we've<00:03:06.260> left

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
the spare on a tough shot and we've left

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.210 
the spare on a tough shot and we've left
the<00:03:06.650> 810<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.139> wheels<00:03:09.290> coming<00:03:09.590> off<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.950> bit

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
the 810 so the wheels coming off a bit

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.860 
the 810 so the wheels coming off a bit
for<00:03:10.430> winning<00:03:10.700> my<00:03:10.790> person<00:03:11.239> who<00:03:11.389> appeared<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.840> be

such<00:03:14.299> as<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.870> case<00:03:15.109> yet<00:03:15.819> she<00:03:16.819> basically

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
such as not the case yet she basically

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.059 
such as not the case yet she basically
does<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> same<00:03:17.870> thing<00:03:18.109> that<00:03:18.260> patty<00:03:18.470> ended<00:03:18.950> on

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
does the same thing that patty ended on

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.240 
does the same thing that patty ended on
the<00:03:19.609> previous<00:03:20.540> frame<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.590> she<00:03:21.980> got<00:03:22.130> the

the previous frame is that she got the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
the previous frame is that she got the
ball<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:23.060> bit<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.420> left<00:03:23.450> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
ball in a little bit to the left the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.569 
ball in a little bit to the left the
ball<00:03:24.109> will<00:03:24.290> not<00:03:24.470> finish<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.950> ball<00:03:25.220> slid<00:03:25.549> a
