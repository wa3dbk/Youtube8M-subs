went<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> uni<00:00:50.370> was<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.270> into

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
went to uni was because I had to go into

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.750 
went to uni was because I had to go into
the<00:00:51.690> quality<00:00:52.140> control<00:00:52.559> room<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.309> make<00:00:53.579> sure

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the quality control room to make sure

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
the quality control room to make sure
one<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.360> edits<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.899> fit<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.410> broadcasting

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
one of my edits was fit for broadcasting

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
one of my edits was fit for broadcasting
and<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.149> went<00:00:57.360> terribly<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.109> missed<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and that just went terribly I missed the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.150

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
much I think that's mostly because

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
much I think that's mostly because
whenever<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> spend<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.250> money<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
whenever I need to spend some money on

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
whenever I need to spend some money on
something<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> wouldn't<00:01:42.360> usually<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.259> can

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
something I wouldn't usually do I can

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
something I wouldn't usually do I can
just<00:01:43.799> sell<00:01:43.979> something<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.430> tf2<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.329> makes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just sell something in tf2 if that makes

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
just sell something in tf2 if that makes
sense<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.740> nice<00:01:47.130> perk<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
sense so it's a nice perk to have and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
sense so it's a nice perk to have and
I'm<00:01:48.119> glad<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> did<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.110> those<00:01:49.229> hours

and he said he'd look into other options

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.460 
and he said he'd look into other options
and<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.120> he<00:02:19.080> found<00:02:19.319> this

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and as you can see he found this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.710 
and as you can see he found this
self-adhesive<00:02:20.100> black<00:02:20.610> plastic<00:02:20.910> sheeting<00:02:21.540> and

self-adhesive black plastic sheeting and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720 
self-adhesive black plastic sheeting and
the<00:02:22.020> only<00:02:22.170> cost<00:02:22.470> six<00:02:22.860> pounds<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the only cost six pounds for a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.730 
the only cost six pounds for a
five-metre<00:02:24.300> role<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.620> is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
five-metre role of it which is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.800 
five-metre role of it which is
equivalent<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.520> ten<00:02:26.819> dollars<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.360> super

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
equivalent to like ten dollars so super

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
equivalent to like ten dollars so super
cheap<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.800> will<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.160> interesting<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.700> how

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
cheap it will be interesting to see how

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.640 
cheap it will be interesting to see how
it<00:02:29.970> holds<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.360> over<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> next<00:02:30.900> few<00:02:31.140> months<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
it holds up over the next few months and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
it holds up over the next few months and
if<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> does<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.580> will<00:02:32.940> probably<00:02:33.180> think<00:02:33.390> about

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
if it does I will probably think about

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.540 
if it does I will probably think about
redoing<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.170> maybe<00:02:34.410> twice<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.950> year<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
redoing this maybe twice a year just to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.970 
redoing this maybe twice a year just to
keep<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.790> nice<00:02:35.940> fresh<00:02:36.270> looking<00:02:36.540> desk<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.770> also
