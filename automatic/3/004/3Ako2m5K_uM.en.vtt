the<00:02:28.860> charcoal<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.329> how<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.510> works<00:02:39.620> make

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the charcoal and see how that works make

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
the charcoal and see how that works make
sure<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:40.980> dampers<00:02:41.489> open<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> pipe<00:02:42.239> dampers

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
sure my dampers open the pipe dampers

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.000 
sure my dampers open the pipe dampers
open<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.799> base<00:02:44.040> burners<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.760> direct<00:02:45.060> draft

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
open the base burners in direct draft

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
open the base burners in direct draft
will<00:02:47.010> open<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> primary<00:02:47.940> dances<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> way

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
will open the primary dances all the way

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.039 
will open the primary dances all the way
and<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:54.920> guess<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.069> Glenwood<00:02:56.569> gets<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.750> start

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
and I guess the Glenwood gets to start

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.120 
and I guess the Glenwood gets to start
off<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.410> party<00:02:59.060> cause<00:03:00.060> she<00:03:00.359> gets<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:01.130> double

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
off the party cause she gets a double

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.530 
off the party cause she gets a double
shot<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:03.739> kerosene<00:03:05.750> two<00:03:06.750> shots<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.350> kerosene

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
shot of kerosene two shots of kerosene

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.539 
shot of kerosene two shots of kerosene
to<00:03:09.540> start<00:03:09.840> off<00:03:09.989> her<00:03:10.200> lap<00:03:10.440> her<00:03:10.739> heating<00:03:11.310> said

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
to start off her lap her heating said

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.729 
to start off her lap her heating said
you<00:03:11.639> care<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:14.269> before<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.420> slowly<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
you care so before this slowly on the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.470 
you care so before this slowly on the
charcoal<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.609> pour<00:03:18.420> too<00:03:19.230> fast<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.209> runs

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
charcoal you pour too fast it just runs

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.740 
charcoal you pour too fast it just runs
off<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.079> want<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.290> pour<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.500> slow<00:03:22.829> enough

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
off but you want to pour it slow enough

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.559 
off but you want to pour it slow enough
that<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.760> kerosene<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:27.000> whatever<00:03:27.299> lighter

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
that the kerosene or whatever lighter

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.050 
that the kerosene or whatever lighter
fluid<00:03:27.870> whatever<00:03:28.260> soaks<00:03:28.590> into<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.060> charcoal

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
fluid whatever soaks into the charcoal

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.870 
fluid whatever soaks into the charcoal
so<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.660> night<00:03:31.250> there<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.400> go

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
so the like night there we go

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.250 
so the like night there we go
so<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:36.569> we<00:03:36.690> will<00:03:36.900> remove

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
so there is to that and we will remove

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.509 
so there is to that and we will remove
the<00:03:37.620> jug<00:03:37.859> of<00:03:38.069> kerosene<00:03:39.410> away<00:03:40.410> from<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.919> fire

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
the jug of kerosene away from the fire

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:51.300 
the jug of kerosene away from the fire
here<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:43.500> let<00:03:44.250> me<00:03:44.340> grab<00:03:44.489> my<00:03:44.609> matches

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:06.020 

whoops

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.710 

I'll<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.270> how<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.630> goes

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.680 

give<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> little<00:04:17.019> secondary<00:04:17.650> air<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.570> off

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
give it a little secondary air and off

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.870 
give it a little secondary air and off
we<00:04:22.900> go<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.350> will<00:04:23.650> say<00:04:23.890> how<00:04:23.950> well<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.340> works

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.660 

let's<00:04:27.880> see<00:04:28.000> how<00:04:28.060> much<00:04:28.180> time<00:04:28.420> we've<00:04:28.630> got<00:04:28.660> here<00:04:29.140> I

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
let's see how much time we've got here I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.180 
let's see how much time we've got here I
got<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> couple<00:04:30.940> minutes<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:32.620> what<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.770> wanted<00:04:33.070> to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
got a couple minutes so what I wanted to

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.710 
got a couple minutes so what I wanted to
do<00:04:33.310> while<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.700> is<00:04:33.910> starting<00:04:34.330> up

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
do while this is starting up

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.620 
do while this is starting up
yeah<00:04:35.020> it's<00:04:35.140> drawing<00:04:35.470> just<00:04:35.620> fine<00:04:36.600> what<00:04:37.600> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
yeah it's drawing just fine what I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.900 
yeah it's drawing just fine what I
wanted<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.050> talk<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.770> about<00:04:38.890> is<00:04:39.250> something

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
wanted to talk to you about is something

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.640 
wanted to talk to you about is something
I<00:04:40.090> forgot<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.420> tell<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.870> about<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.260> other<00:04:41.380> day

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
I forgot to tell you about the other day

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.130 
I forgot to tell you about the other day
when<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.160> was<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.460> over<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.790> features<00:04:43.240> I'm

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
when I was going over the features I'm

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.730 
when I was going over the features I'm
so<00:04:44.380> busy<00:04:44.800> trying<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:46.290> go<00:04:47.290> over<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:47.620> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
so busy trying to go over all the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.950 
so busy trying to go over all the
details<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.340> forgot<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.790> main<00:04:49.000> aspect<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.870> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
details I forgot the main aspect and the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.330 
details I forgot the main aspect and the
design<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.530> stove<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.010> that's<00:04:51.160> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
design of the stove and that's the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.360 
design of the stove and that's the
overall<00:04:51.970> shape<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.690> as<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:53.800> notice<00:04:54.160> it's

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
overall shape of it as you notice it's

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.140 
overall shape of it as you notice it's
tall<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.910> round<00:04:55.770> versus<00:04:56.770> short<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.850> square

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
tall and round versus short and square

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.710 
tall and round versus short and square
like<00:04:58.450> today's<00:04:59.200> coal<00:04:59.560> stoves<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.360> reason

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
like today's coal stoves so the reason

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.000 
like today's coal stoves so the reason
this<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:01.900> done<00:05:02.290> this<00:05:02.470> way

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
this is done this way

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.240 
this is done this way
if<00:05:03.790> you've<00:05:04.060> ever<00:05:04.210> read<00:05:04.570> about<00:05:04.870> how<00:05:05.250> combustion

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
if you've ever read about how combustion

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.580 
if you've ever read about how combustion
works<00:05:06.490> on<00:05:06.850> various<00:05:07.210> fuels<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:08.440> have

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
works on various fuels you have

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.460 
works on various fuels you have
basically<00:05:08.980> three<00:05:09.310> components<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:10.090> have

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
basically three components you have

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.190 
basically three components you have
carbon<00:05:11.470> give<00:05:12.190> hydrocarbons<00:05:13.120> that's<00:05:13.510> what<00:05:13.750> you

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
carbon give hydrocarbons that's what you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.020 
carbon give hydrocarbons that's what you
see<00:05:14.410> burning<00:05:14.770> right<00:05:14.919> that's<00:05:15.190> hydrocarbons

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
see burning right that's hydrocarbons

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.750 
see burning right that's hydrocarbons
that's<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.390> gaseous<00:05:16.930> part<00:05:17.260> of<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.410> fuel<00:05:17.760> and

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
that's the gaseous part of the fuel and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.340 
that's the gaseous part of the fuel and
then<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:19.180> inert<00:05:19.510> matter<00:05:19.750> which<00:05:20.050> comes

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
then you have inert matter which comes

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.070 
then you have inert matter which comes
out<00:05:20.500> as<00:05:20.680> leftovers<00:05:21.100> ash<00:05:21.550> after<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.660> carbon

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
out as leftovers ash after the carbon

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.830 
out as leftovers ash after the carbon
and<00:05:23.169> hydrocarbons<00:05:23.890> are<00:05:23.950> burned<00:05:24.840> anthracite

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
and hydrocarbons are burned anthracite

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.120 
and hydrocarbons are burned anthracite
coal<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:26.410> mostly<00:05:26.919> carbon<00:05:27.400> over<00:05:28.030> 80%<00:05:29.130> but

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
coal is mostly carbon over 80% but

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.220 
coal is mostly carbon over 80% but
however<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.610> still<00:05:30.820> has<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> lot<00:05:31.480> of<00:05:31.510> volatile

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
however it still has a lot of volatile

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.460 
however it still has a lot of volatile
gases<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.890> hydrocarbons<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.870> stove<00:05:35.260> is
