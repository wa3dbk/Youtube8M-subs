the beginning of the game which
basically<00:00:15.570> means<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.049> we're<00:00:16.379> almost<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
basically means that we're almost to the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.849 
basically means that we're almost to the
end<00:00:17.270> we're<00:00:18.270> four<00:00:18.720> levels<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
end we're four levels from here to the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.330 
end we're four levels from here to the
end<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.390> means<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.500> level<00:00:22.949> in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
end so that means one this level in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.540 
end so that means one this level in
three<00:00:23.699> more<00:00:23.820> levels

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
anyway he's gonna keep going up

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.020 
anyway he's gonna keep going up
carefully<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:18.860> Eric's<00:03:19.190> turn<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.670> hate

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
carefully now it's Eric's turn I hate

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.510 
carefully now it's Eric's turn I hate
this<00:03:20.270> part<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.890> want<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.280> carefully

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
this part so you want to carefully

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.350 
this part so you want to carefully
navigate<00:03:23.180> these<00:03:23.300> platforms<00:03:25.870> carefully<00:03:26.900> I

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
navigate these platforms carefully I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.150 
navigate these platforms carefully I
missed<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:30.230> want<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.470> try<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.950> top

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
missed you want to try to get on the top

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.050 
missed you want to try to get on the top
platform<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:32.000> for<00:03:32.150> safety<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.540> think<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:34.060> think

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
platform just for safety I think I think

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.550 
platform just for safety I think I think
that<00:03:35.150> was<00:03:35.270> more<00:03:35.450> safe<00:03:35.660> they're<00:03:35.990> safer<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.530> be

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
that was more safe they're safer to be

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.130 
that was more safe they're safer to be
on<00:03:43.150> that's<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.570> was<00:03:44.660> kind<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:44.900> close

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
on that's that that was kind of close

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.699 
on that's that that was kind of close
actually

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
actually

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.890 
actually
then<00:03:47.310> once<00:03:47.640> run<00:03:48.269> away<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.599> all<00:03:48.719> those

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
then once run away for all those

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.619 
then once run away for all those
platforms<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:49.620> up<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:50.430> carefully<00:03:51.390> hop

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
platforms to go up then carefully hop

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.770 
platforms to go up then carefully hop
across<00:03:53.359> Bayley<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.480> cute<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> arrow<00:03:55.170> through
