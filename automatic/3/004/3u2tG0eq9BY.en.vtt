the hype about the class a 32 channels
of<00:00:15.269> summing<00:00:15.839> that's<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.529> want<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> know

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
of summing that's what we want to know

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.680 
of summing that's what we want to know
what<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.520> does<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.880> mean<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> do

exactly um does it have a cape it might
it<00:00:23.010> might<00:00:23.930> it's<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.199> separates<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.609> studio

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
it might it's what separates this studio

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.830 
it might it's what separates this studio
from<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.760> other<00:00:29.970> guys<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
from the other guys out there and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.269 
from the other guys out there and
separates<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> men<00:00:31.289> from<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> boys<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.980> far

got its own little you know it's it's
your<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:53.970> eliminating<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> factor<00:02:54.930> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
your you're eliminating the factor of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.750 
your you're eliminating the factor of
bottlenecking<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:56.370> you're<00:02:56.489> when<00:02:56.640> you're

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.880 
bottlenecking when you're when you're
mixing<00:02:56.970> digital<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:58.200> got<00:02:58.319> everything<00:02:58.530> going

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
mixing digital you got everything going

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.780 
mixing digital you got everything going
down<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.190> little<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.790> like<00:03:00.140> traffic

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
down this little it's like traffic

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.270 
down this little it's like traffic
getting<00:03:02.790> merged<00:03:03.090> into<00:03:03.269> one<00:03:03.390> lane<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.769> got<00:03:04.920> six

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
getting merged into one lane you got six

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.250 
getting merged into one lane you got six
lanes<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.760> highway<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.390> everything

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
lanes of highway and everything

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
lanes of highway and everything
eventually<00:03:07.409> gets<00:03:07.769> merged<00:03:07.980> into<00:03:08.190> one<00:03:08.310> lane<00:03:08.730> all

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
eventually gets merged into one lane all

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.789 
eventually gets merged into one lane all
that<00:03:09.329> traffic's<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.989> slow<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.319> down<00:03:10.349> it's

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
that traffic's got to slow it down it's

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.649 
that traffic's got to slow it down it's
got<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.250> start<00:03:11.579> creeping<00:03:11.940> along<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.359> fine<00:03:12.629> a

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
got to start creeping along a fine a

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.080 
got to start creeping along a fine a
place<00:03:12.959> where<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.319> go<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> same<00:03:14.700> scenario

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
place where to go it's the same scenario

everything is not going to the same

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.319 
everything is not going to the same
place<00:03:52.079> at<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.739> time<00:03:53.060> maybe<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.180> have

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
place at one time maybe you have

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.759 
place at one time maybe you have
keyboards<00:03:54.750> playing<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.199> section<00:03:55.470> and

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
keyboards playing in this section and

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.170 
keyboards playing in this section and
not<00:03:55.919> an<00:03:56.040> ass<00:03:56.190> session<00:03:56.489> they<00:03:56.699> could<00:03:56.879> share<00:03:57.150> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
not an ass session they could share that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780 
not an ass session they could share that
bus<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.919> so<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.010> could<00:03:59.099> have<00:03:59.220> stereo<00:03:59.519> buses

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
bus that so you could have stereo buses

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.270 
bus that so you could have stereo buses
you<00:03:59.879> could<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.090> mono<00:04:00.299> buses<00:04:00.810> it's<00:04:01.319> it's<00:04:01.889> it's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
you could have mono buses it's it's it's

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.220 
you could have mono buses it's it's it's
it's<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.639> console<00:04:03.109> essentially<00:04:04.109> without

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
it's a console essentially without

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.710 
it's a console essentially without
faders<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:04.799> without<00:04:05.250> eq's<00:04:05.699> and<00:04:05.849> without<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
faders and without eq's and without you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.270 
faders and without eq's and without you
know<00:04:06.840> any<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.139> any<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.470> toys<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:08.129> it's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
know any of the any of the toys but it's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
know any of the any of the toys but it's
essentially<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.090> console<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:09.810> your

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
essentially a console is how your

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.169 
essentially a console is how your
