00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.040
 hides behind this shortcut 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080
 concentrated power because amg is the high 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.910
 performance brand of mercedes benz and 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.040

 Serial models in the vehicle program 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.300
 but also have the smallest model series 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.810
 the stuttgarter to the Geneva

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.439
 in the luggage 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.130
 are very proud because a45 am that 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 the most efficient and great car we have 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:47.739
 each had an output of 360 ps 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:50.019
 180 ps per liter capacity is the a45 amg 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.739
 the sportiest class ever 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.320

 but that is no longer possible today 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.640
 at the expense of the environment 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.840
 this is an absolute high-tech engine with 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.600
 led there we get 360 ps out of two 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.820
 but only 6 in the European cycle 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 benchmark position 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.120
 so that the force is also correct on the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.160

 seconds on front or rear axle 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.110
