00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:26.198
Finale Ligure is the undisputed European home for climbers

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.650
Here we have more than 3000 routes equipped more than 170 walls, "cliffs"

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:40.296
the rock is of excellent quality

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:44.296
furthermore, here in Finale we have a wonderful microclimate

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.628
winter is mild

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.101
and especially for foreigners, coming from Germany for example, is perfect

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.789
here there is everything a climber might desire

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
in Finale Ligure nothing is missing

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.580
we have beautiful landscapes, we have a perfect climate

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.580
there is the sea and cliffs just behind

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.210
all cliffs can be reached in 20-30 minutes

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.752
and this makes Finale Ligure very handy

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.629
It is very easy to go climbing: from Finalborgo or Finale Marina

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.310
you can get to almost every cliff 
in a short time, by car

00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:47.898
Finale Ligure does not have
"extremely" easy routes, 

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.275
nor "extremely" difficult ones

00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:54.347
but "extremely difficult" 
means routes

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.674
that just two-three people 
in the world can climb!

00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.211
the truth is that there aren't 
"extreme" routes

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:09.968
and ther are no "extremely" easy routes

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:15.621
we have many routes of medium difficulty

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.410
however, for a novice, 

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.791
someone who has just started, 

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:23.534
there are not many routes 
which can be climbed

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:26.442
this is due to the morphology 
of the territory

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:31.455
we do not have sloping walls, but 
only vertical or overhanging ones

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:40.366
we must make a very 
important clarification

00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:45.838
generally "free climbing" is 
thought as a climb without safety

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:52.043
instead "free climbing" means 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.759
a climbing without artificial 
helps for progression

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:02.705
"bouldering" is a climbing

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:10.173
over boulders up to 10 metres high, 

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.291
and it is a very violent climb,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:20.984
and if you fall there is
a mattress beneath

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.911
my advice to climbers

00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:32.656
when it comes to cliffs conditions

00:03:34.352 --> 00:03:38.352
is to check always that 
routes are properly equipped

00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:44.614
my time is divided among

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:52.284
writing book about climbing
and tourism in general

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.034
training and practise on cliffs

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:01.842
and also on equipping
routes and cliffs

00:04:02.273 --> 00:04:04.273
equipping is the activity I like most

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:11.387
sometimes, I happen to go back 
to previously equipped routes

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.565
and if I see something wrong, I make correction and mainteinance

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:21.576
my projects are always related
to opening 

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.089
and equipping new routes and cliffs

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.531
therefore I have always new projects

00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.741
to retrain old cliffs

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:39.168
I usually retrain old cliffs

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.980
by taking off old nails 
and putting new ones

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.620
and if there is space, 
I add new routes

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:59.162
this summer I will equipe a route c
alled Bric Grigio - placca superiore

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:05.679
this cliff is close to 
Finale Ligure, near Felino

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.170
and it is very, very, panoramic

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:12.498
the access is not very easy

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:17.718
Last year I applied 
34 steps, manually!

00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:23.518
it is about a 30 minutes climb

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:28.496
from the top one can see 
a beautiful landscape

00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:32.424
you get there through 
a short equipped trail

00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:42.703
about 7 years ago I wrote a book

00:05:44.304 --> 00:05:47.304
it is a guide translated 
in English and German

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:51.995
and it is a collection of some cliffs

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.638
which I equipped 
here in Finale Ligure

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:58.615
the title is "Finale by Thomas"

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.148
the second guide is 
about farms and b-b

00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:08.202
the title is "Finale... not only sea"

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.120
after that, an editor 
called Versante Sud

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.669
specialised in mountains guides

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:24.559
called me to check my availability

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.770
to write a complete guide 
about Fianle Ligure cliffs

00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:37.117
in a couple of years I managed

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.899
to go around the territory 
and collect

00:06:43.043 --> 00:06:45.043
pictures and material for the book

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.899
at the moment I am writing a
 guide about "tracking"

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:57.996
it will be released in 
Semptember 2013

00:07:02.508 --> 00:07:06.508
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
JOB IN THE WORLD
