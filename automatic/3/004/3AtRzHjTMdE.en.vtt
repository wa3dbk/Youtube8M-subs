bass player will now be playing an A so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.300 
bass player will now be playing an A so
this<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.360> b-flat<00:01:07.840> this<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> b-flat<00:01:08.860> slash

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
this is a b-flat this is a b-flat slash

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.020 
this is a b-flat this is a b-flat slash
a<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.320> usually<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.920> we'll<00:01:12.550> start<00:01:12.850> this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
a and as we usually do we'll start this

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.910 
a and as we usually do we'll start this
lesson<00:01:13.270> by<00:01:13.630> going<00:01:13.930> through<00:01:14.080> each<00:01:14.259> section<00:01:14.619> of

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
lesson by going through each section of

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.950 
lesson by going through each section of
the<00:01:15.009> song<00:01:15.250> playing<00:01:15.729> every<00:01:16.270> chord<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.660> its<00:01:16.780> root

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the song playing every chord in its root

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.320 
the song playing every chord in its root
position<00:01:17.190> will<00:01:18.190> then<00:01:18.369> follow<00:01:18.550> this<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:19.060> by

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
position will then follow this up by

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.760 
position will then follow this up by
using<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.780> technique<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.320> finding<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
using the technique of finding the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.580 
using the technique of finding the
nearest<00:01:20.920> inversion<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.810> now<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.140> playing<00:01:23.350> an

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
nearest inversion so now I'm playing an

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.030 
nearest inversion so now I'm playing an
f7<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.840> now<00:01:25.990> from<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.229> I'm<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
f7 and now from here I'm going to go to

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.800 
f7 and now from here I'm going to go to
b-flat<00:01:27.460> I've<00:01:27.880> got<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.180> beef<00:01:28.300> up<00:01:28.479> right

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
b-flat I've got to beef up right

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.780 
b-flat I've got to beef up right
underneath<00:01:29.110> my<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.619> I'm<00:01:29.860> done<00:01:30.040> right<00:01:30.520> here

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
underneath my and I'm done right here

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.590 
underneath my and I'm done right here
b-flat<00:01:31.660> indeed<00:01:32.190> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.850> song<00:01:34.060> specific

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
b-flat indeed in the song specific

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.570 
b-flat indeed in the song specific
technique<00:01:34.990> section<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.710> lesson<00:01:35.890> I'll

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
technique section of the lesson I'll

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.100 
technique section of the lesson I'll
show<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.880> how<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.149> play<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.539> verse<00:01:37.720> several
