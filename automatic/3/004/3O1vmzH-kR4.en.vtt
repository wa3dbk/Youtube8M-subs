00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
image this is the original image so I

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
image this is the original image so I
opened<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.000> my<00:00:24.300> painted<00:00:24.779> textures<00:00:25.230> actions

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
opened up my painted textures actions

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.580 
opened up my painted textures actions
and<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.910> give<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.720> super

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and I'm going to give this a super

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.060 
and I'm going to give this a super
sharpen<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.359> run<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.529> action

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
sharpen over here and run that action

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.520 
sharpen over here and run that action
and<00:00:32.660> I'm<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> leave<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.320> full

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and I'm going to leave it at full

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.370 
and I'm going to leave it at full
strength<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> layer<00:00:36.630> merge

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
strength and go up to layer merge

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220 
strength and go up to layer merge
visible<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.420> next<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> give<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
visible and next I'm going to give it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
visible and next I'm going to give it
more<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.340> warm<00:00:42.000> glow<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> I'm<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> go

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
more of a warm glow so I'm going to go

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
more of a warm glow so I'm going to go
down<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.239> golden<00:00:45.780> glow<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.039> run

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
down to golden glow over here and run

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.299 
down to golden glow over here and run
that<00:00:47.520> action<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> increase

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that action and I'm going to increase

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
that action and I'm going to increase
its<00:00:50.550> intensity<00:00:51.239> by<00:00:51.480> increasing<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> opacity

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
its intensity by increasing the opacity

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180 
its intensity by increasing the opacity
of<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.829> layer<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
of that layer and I kind of like just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.090 
of that layer and I kind of like just
about<00:00:56.489> where<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.770> go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
about where that is so I'm going to go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
about where that is so I'm going to go
up<00:00:59.250> again<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.969> layer<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.690> down<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.559> merge

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
up again to layer and down to merge

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
up again to layer and down to merge
visible<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:04.170> ready<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> put<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
visible and now we're ready to put the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
visible and now we're ready to put the
texture<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> image<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
texture over this image now I'm going to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
texture over this image now I'm going to
swing<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> texture<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.430> top<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> image

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
swing this texture on top of the image

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.190 
swing this texture on top of the image
by<00:01:12.630> grabbing<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.320> move<00:01:13.560> tool<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.189> just

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
by grabbing my move tool and just

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.070 
by grabbing my move tool and just
swinging<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.409> across<00:01:16.799> press<00:01:17.369> okay<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
swinging it across press okay and here

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
swinging it across press okay and here
it<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.280> I'm<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> take<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> texture<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it is I'm going to take that texture and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
it is I'm going to take that texture and
minimize<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.830> need<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
minimize it because we don't need it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:23.570 
minimize it because we don't need it
right<00:01:23.310> now

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
right now

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.899 
right now
and<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.200> play<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.909> resizing

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and now we can play around with resizing

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
and now we can play around with resizing
this<00:01:27.060> texture<00:01:27.540> over<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> image<00:01:28.439> press

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
this texture over the image press

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510 
this texture over the image press
command<00:01:29.880> T<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.170> bounding<00:01:31.740> boxes<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
command T to get your bounding boxes and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
command T to get your bounding boxes and
you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.090> pull<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> different<00:01:34.619> ways<00:01:34.860> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you can pull them in different ways like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.080 
you can pull them in different ways like
this<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.860> hold<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> shift<00:01:38.759> key

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
this or you can hold down the shift key

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230 
this or you can hold down the shift key
while<00:01:39.450> doing<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.909> resize<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
while doing this and it will resize in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.350 
while doing this and it will resize in
proportion<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.299> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
proportion but that's really not that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.499 
proportion but that's really not that
important<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> particular<00:01:46.649> texture

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
important with this particular texture

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.020 
important with this particular texture
so<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.320> over<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> our<00:01:49.979> layers<00:01:50.340> pallet

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so we go over here to our layers pallet

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.920 
so we go over here to our layers pallet
and<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.450> texture<00:01:54.780> has

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and you can see that the texture has

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
and you can see that the texture has
formed<00:01:55.320> its<00:01:55.530> own<00:01:55.770> layer<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.280> we're<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
formed its own layer and we're going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
formed its own layer and we're going to
pull<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> opacity<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.049> can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
pull back on the opacity so we can

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
pull back on the opacity so we can
actually<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> image<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
actually see where the image is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.380 
actually see where the image is
underneath<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.500> reposition

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
underneath and then we can reposition

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.020 
underneath and then we can reposition
this<00:02:03.390> texture<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.219> resize<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this texture like this and resize it to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.139 
this texture like this and resize it to
our<00:02:06.270> liking<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.310> when<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.849> looking

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
our liking and when we get it looking

the<00:02:14.130> transformation<00:02:18.410> I've<00:02:19.410> changed<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the transformation I've changed the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.310 
the transformation I've changed the
blend<00:02:20.340> mode<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.970> layer<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.570> overlay<00:02:21.690> just

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
blend mode of this layer to overlay just

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.280 
blend mode of this layer to overlay just
to<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.680> how<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:23.550> look<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.660> I'd<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
to see how it will look but I'd like to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
to see how it will look but I'd like to
duplicate<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.950> layer<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.430> give<00:02:26.580> me<00:02:26.760> more

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
duplicate the layer to give me more

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
duplicate the layer to give me more
freedom<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.570> designing<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.950> go

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
freedom in designing so I'm going to go

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.970 
freedom in designing so I'm going to go
up<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.550> layer<00:02:30.350> duplicate<00:02:31.350> layer<00:02:31.970> okay<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
up to layer duplicate layer okay and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.280 
up to layer duplicate layer okay and
right<00:02:34.980> away<00:02:35.100> things<00:02:35.580> get<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.390> exciting<00:02:36.930> here

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
right away things get more exciting here

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.710 
right away things get more exciting here
and<00:02:37.440> now<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> lot<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.060> fun<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.540> can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
and now we can have a lot of fun we can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.210 
and now we can have a lot of fun we can
play<00:02:39.960> with<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.200> blend<00:02:40.440> modes<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.830> both<00:02:40.980> of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
play with the blend modes of both of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.300 
play with the blend modes of both of
these<00:02:41.340> layers<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.050> top<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.890> think<00:02:44.220> I'm

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
these layers so the top one I think I'm

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.460 
these layers so the top one I think I'm
going<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.610> set<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> color<00:02:45.390> burn<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.110> hundred

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
going to set to color burn at a hundred

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.430 
going to set to color burn at a hundred
percent<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.730> bottom<00:02:48.330> I'm<00:02:48.600> going<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.170> set

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
percent in the bottom I'm going to set

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.449 
percent in the bottom I'm going to set
to<00:02:49.940> screen<00:02:51.050> also<00:02:52.050> at<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> hundred<00:02:52.709> percent<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to screen also at a hundred percent and

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.570 
to screen also at a hundred percent and
I<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.390> way<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> looks<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.580> I

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
I really like the way that looks and I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.900 
I really like the way that looks and I
think<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.209> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.570> leave<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.140> image<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.790> is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.730 

all<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.209> remains<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> merge<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.709> layers

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
all that remains is to merge the layers

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.730 
all that remains is to merge the layers
and<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> crop<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.880> image<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.200> I'm<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
and to crop this image so I'm going to

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.060 
and to crop this image so I'm going to
touch<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> top<00:03:08.670> layer<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:10.070> layer

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
touch on the top layer go up to layer

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.840 
touch on the top layer go up to layer
and<00:03:11.490> down<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.060> merge<00:03:12.270> visible<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.670> then<00:03:14.670> I'm

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
and down to merge visible and then I'm

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.570 
and down to merge visible and then I'm
going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.209> go<00:03:15.450> over<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.860> rectangular

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
going to go over to my rectangular

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.360 
going to go over to my rectangular
marquee<00:03:18.120> tool<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.850> drag<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.120> across

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
marquee tool and just drag that across

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.699 
marquee tool and just drag that across
and<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.550> up<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.000> image<00:03:24.480> crop<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.810> then<00:03:27.810> hit

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and go up to image crop and then hit

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.920

command D and deselect and this image is

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.250 
command D and deselect and this image is
pretty<00:03:34.230> much<00:03:34.560> done<00:03:35.000> what<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> might<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
pretty much done what I might do is I

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.850 
pretty much done what I might do is I
might<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.620> over<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.040> my<00:03:38.160> actions<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.530> add<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
might go over to my actions and add a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.229 
might go over to my actions and add a
levels<00:03:41.400> boost<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:45.530> maybe<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:47.370> over<00:03:47.400> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
levels boost and maybe go over to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.720 
levels boost and maybe go over to
lighten<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.489> run<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.670> lighten<00:03:51.769> action<00:03:52.769> but
