 You and you can see here in the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 The corner of my screen was 17 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 combination of 7,600 inscribed this copy of the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.450
 windows is not genuine then it will be the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.159
 you will see why it is not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 Original first, you guys, I'll show you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.860
 for you back from the start menu start 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:27.220
 control panel system and security 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.180
 the system and that you will see only one 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.150
 You must activate 11 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.760
 you should activate activate windows today 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.710
 now that is saying that the people 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.040
 have a captivate today you're giving me the option 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.750
 to activate or else now and here is the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 product id 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.430
 It's but how is this form that is a form 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 harder it would be you and for 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.360
 here o 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.490
 you can activate your windows is to be a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.330
 coolest way only that the way most 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.200
 difficult therefore does not have a program that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.390
 It can make our life a lot easier. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.580
 here 3rd side windows wanted this one 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.690
 Boat for me here. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.630
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.770
 if here one on the side he has the options 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.250
 everyone here speaks all the options of the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.050
 version but I can not say more at 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.320
 team side can create larger version 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.410
 of the computer that can pick up that would be 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.910
 from 86 thousand kits up to 86 thousand 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:47.220
 it captures this activation of windows 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.220
 here are a lot more things here 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.610
 you can put you want to put 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.410
 that theme would animate the other 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.680
 I'm not very much in order. 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.770
 You see here in profile that the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.710

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.550
 for you to understand change the page the links 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.490
 to be paulo came down in our configuration 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.280
 of the nasa are important but the 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.300
 important even though this is already in 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.300
 show you 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.600
 So it 's up to us to make 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.180

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.920
 who needs who is by the post does is 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.470
 That site of what you have to wait for 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.959
 both according to the own of lowering the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.920
 regular donwload if you do not have the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.320
 download the world gold of course it is a 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.160
 Very good website that never wanted to 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.160
 leave in hand 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.610
 So , guys, the ones that click are ok. 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:15.430
 that example I'm going to perform that 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:19.280
 tank will not restart and as soon as 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.970

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.970

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.160
 can wait some time 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.430
 and so on because the neighborhood is the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.390
 grip balzac with power back recording 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.390
 with you thanks 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.300
 It's personal but meanwhile it's what I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.600
 I'll say a little more to answer a 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.130
 very very reliable problem 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.289
 if I'm using make a video lesson 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.630
 You can know that you are very trustworthy. 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.220
 you can always use also has to 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.410
 windows xp vista up for linux has 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.520
 what is very difficult for you 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.020
 to find software is to be faked 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.020
 but if any does have 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.120
 so the staff is already taking a 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:22.479
 I'm not going to rate the video here 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.479
 or as soon as I start the pc I come back 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.820
 and then the people go and I think 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.880
 You already noticed ak in the corner of this 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.730
 screen that disappeared with that message 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:41.360
 here we had then we go there again in 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:44.360
 control panel security system 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 system 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:51.390
 have a look here 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.700
 windows activated this only became today 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.100
 it's not custom microsoft 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.070
 So, people like yours are being 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.000

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.940
 other accessories that this is my case 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.290
 as my world uses windows starter you 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.320

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.730
