version<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.899> pact<00:00:55.079> Japanese<00:00:55.469> set<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
version this pact Japanese set but it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
version this pact Japanese set but it
will<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.120> version<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> pack<00:00:57.870> i'm

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
will not be in our version this pack i'm

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.510 
will not be in our version this pack i'm
thinking<00:00:58.710> maybe<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> hero

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
thinking maybe where we get the hero

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
thinking maybe where we get the hero
strike<00:00:59.879> structure<00:01:00.420> deck<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.719> step<00:01:00.870> strato<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
strike structure deck and step strato so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529 
strike structure deck and step strato so
it<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.680> possibly<00:01:01.829> include<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.489> card<00:01:02.789> but

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it could possibly include this card but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
it could possibly include this card but
that's<00:01:03.989> again<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> guess<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.369> mean

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that's again that's just a guess I mean

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
that's again that's just a guess I mean
no<00:01:06.030> confirmation<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.720> anything<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
no confirmation on anything of that we

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.140 
no confirmation on anything of that we
don't<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.520> how<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> say<00:01:08.850> we're<00:01:09.060> gonna

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
don't even know how to say we're gonna

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
don't even know how to say we're gonna
go<00:01:09.299> strike<00:01:09.600> struck<00:01:09.930> check<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.320> more<00:01:10.799> likely

heroes<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.770> they're<00:01:49.920> giving<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
heroes that it's like they're giving to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
heroes that it's like they're giving to
us<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> replace<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> Stratos<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
us that kind of replace the Stratos so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
us that kind of replace the Stratos so
that's<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.049> find<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.140> cut<00:01:55.259> funny

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that's pretty good to find it cut funny

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.510 
that's pretty good to find it cut funny
they<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.799> mentioned<00:01:56.100> polymerization

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they actually mentioned polymerization

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800 
they actually mentioned polymerization
of<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.270> where<00:01:57.390> these<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.600> too<00:01:57.719> many

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of you know where these see too many

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.819 
of you know where these see too many
heretics<00:01:58.020> these<00:01:58.409> days<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.680> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
heretics these days there more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.410 
heretics these days there more
competitive<00:01:58.920> again<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> use

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
competitive again that I use

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.639 
competitive again that I use
polymerization<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.079> mainly<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.409> course

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
polymerization it's mainly of course

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
polymerization it's mainly of course
miracle<00:02:01.979> fusion<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> other<00:02:02.549> things<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.450> it's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
miracle fusion and other things so it's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.940 
miracle fusion and other things so it's
kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> cool<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> actually<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.920> i

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
kind of cool to actually see one that i

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
kind of cool to actually see one that i
can<00:02:05.460> use<00:02:05.490> polymerization<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.810> of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
can use polymerization so that's kind of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.880 
can use polymerization so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.350> wonder<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.740> manage

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
interesting with me wonder if we manage

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410 
interesting with me wonder if we manage
to<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.280> her<00:02:08.610> edx<00:02:08.849> actually<00:02:09.209> use<00:02:09.330> some

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to see her edx actually use some

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.540 
to see her edx actually use some
polymerization<00:02:09.780> again

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
polymerization again

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.010 
polymerization again

if you're setting up plays for a miracle
fusion<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.200> not<00:02:18.620> only<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.370> can<00:02:19.670> actually

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
fusion and not only that it can actually

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.700 
fusion and not only that it can actually
mass<00:02:20.330> change<00:02:20.750> whenever<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> becomes<00:02:21.470> I've

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
mass change whenever it becomes I've

mass change whenever it becomes I've
seen<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.920> since<00:02:22.100> shadow<00:02:22.340> miss<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.790> the

seen you since shadow miss to the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.930 
graveyard and the mess change for dark
Hall<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:25.070> example<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.580> course<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.850> know

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
Hall for example or of course you know

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.160 
Hall for example or of course you know
there's<00:02:26.150> many<00:02:26.330> other<00:02:26.420> combinations<00:02:27.020> with

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
there's many other combinations with

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.230 
there's many other combinations with
that<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:27.620> yeah<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.430> mean<00:02:28.490> that's<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.000> pretty

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that but yeah I mean that's just pretty

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.060 
that but yeah I mean that's just pretty
crazy<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.690> itself<00:02:29.750> because<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.710> can<00:02:30.920> bring

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
crazy in itself because it you can bring

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.740 
crazy in itself because it you can bring
out<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> fusion<00:02:31.580> monster<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.600> was

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
out a fusion monster like that so I was

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.880 
out a fusion monster like that so I was
kind<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.960> wondering<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.350> did<00:02:33.530> some<00:02:33.650> reading<00:02:33.770> to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
kind of wondering I did some reading to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.960 
kind of wondering I did some reading to
make<00:02:34.040> sure<00:02:34.190> i<00:02:34.220> was<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.670> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
make sure i was right on that and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.610 
make sure i was right on that and
supposedly<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.870> possible<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.530> can

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
supposedly that is possible you can

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.990 
supposedly that is possible you can
actually<00:02:36.770> mass<00:02:37.010> change<00:02:37.250> which<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.580> figured<00:02:37.880> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
actually mass change which I figured it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.520 
actually mass change which I figured it
would<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.390> mean<00:02:38.630> considering<00:02:38.930> again<00:02:39.290> hero

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
would I mean considering again hero

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.020 
would I mean considering again hero
strike<00:02:39.770> coming<00:02:39.980> out<00:02:40.070> recently<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.820> with<00:02:40.910> all

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
strike coming out recently and with all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.700

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
way to so kind of indifferent about it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.520 
really got the chance for you to test
them<00:04:15.769> out<00:04:15.800> too<00:04:15.980> much

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530

and yeah I can't wait to see what this
one's<00:04:19.139> going<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.980> again<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.790> seems<00:04:20.940> a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
one's going to do and again it seems a

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.390 
one's going to do and again it seems a
little<00:04:21.120> situational<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.010> can't<00:04:23.010> wait<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.190> see

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
little situational and can't wait to see

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100 
little situational and can't wait to see
what<00:04:23.670> is<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.389> going<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.600> end<00:04:24.690> up<00:04:24.750> turning<00:04:24.900> out

what is is going to end up turning out

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.690 
what is is going to end up turning out
to<00:04:25.169> be<00:04:25.290> as<00:04:25.590> well<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:25.950> think<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.430> lot<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.610> people

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
to be as well I think a lot of people

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.780 
to be as well I think a lot of people
there<00:04:26.910> are<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.389> that<00:04:27.720> boat<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.050> well<00:04:28.490> l<00:04:29.490> should

there are in that boat as well l should

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.510 
there are in that boat as well l should
all<00:04:29.940> check<00:04:30.270> chanukah<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.310> let's<00:04:32.310> see<00:04:32.490> I

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
all check chanukah and let's see I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.320 
all check chanukah and let's see I
believe<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.919> level<00:04:34.919> 10<00:04:35.460> monster<00:04:35.880> earth

frickin<00:05:50.130> awesome<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.789> let's<00:05:51.750> hope<00:05:51.930> that

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
frickin awesome and let's hope that

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.930 
frickin awesome and let's hope that
maybe<00:05:52.500> they<00:05:52.740> change<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.280> name<00:05:53.550> though<00:05:53.789> as

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
maybe they change that name though as

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.370 
maybe they change that name though as
they<00:05:54.120> probably<00:05:54.360> will<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.810> translation

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
they probably will the translation

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.350 
they probably will the translation
because<00:05:55.530> it'd<00:05:56.310> be<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.460> lot<00:05:56.640> easier<00:05:56.700> for<00:05:57.240> me<00:05:57.330> if
