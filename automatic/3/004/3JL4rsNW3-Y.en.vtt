00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
scrubbing it into my face and then me

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.190 
scrubbing it into my face and then me

focus on my t-zone area where I'm really
oily<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:29.060> best<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.870> rinse<00:02:30.140> it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
just warm because of the salt it just

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.570 
just warm because of the salt it just
rinses<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.760> off<00:02:43.880> more<00:02:44.330> better<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.070> when<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.310> did
