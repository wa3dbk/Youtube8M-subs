00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 certain habits die hard like 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
 in the case of the gas cars they are 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.039
 consider a bit like machines of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 slower and less equipped b series 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.800
 of the gasoline or diesel sisters 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.570
 but if there is a model that can do 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 change opinion on methane and this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 new volkswagen golf and tg because the car 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 best selling in Europe and among the most 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 sold in Italy this is the first 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 golf that leaves the factory with cylinders 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 the double is integrated into the platform 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.210
 filler for refueling 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 gasoline and methane is a engine designed 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 specifically to work agazzi 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 and then it's a bluemotion version a 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 optimized to consume less 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.559
 the front is practically sealed for 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
 improve penetration to riina mica 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.949
 for rolling resistance instead 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.870
 who are special alloy wheels from 16 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.059
 dedicated to this model with tires 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.120
 low friction always for 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.180
 there are details about aerodynamics 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 profiles around 18 is a curiosity the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 exhaust terminal and front below 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 to the rear wheels to leave 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.760
 space for gas cylinders is the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.869
 result is that golf is behind 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.659
 it looks like an electric car to methane 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 without any muffler the trunk 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 instead it is a bit smaller than a golf a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 petrol or diesel but not by much 291 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 liters against 380 of minimum capacity 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 this is because under the floor 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.710
 there are two 15 kg gas bottles 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.079
 in addition to the normal tank of the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 50 liter petrol 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 this means that gas golf is not 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 approved as monovalent as the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.990
 citycar up and that there is no place for the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.189
 there is a spare tire in its place 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.470
 with the compressor 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.960
 otherwise the shape is enough 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 regular and the coatings are of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.939
 quality 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.320
 the presence of the cylinders does not have instead 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.759
 reduced the space behind where 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.680
 habitability for passengers not 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.479
 the instrumentation changes instead it was 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.890
 adapted for gas conversion 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.540
 there are two fuel indicators 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.800
 petrol 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.000
 but methane and the on-board computer 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.280
 on the infotainment screen 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 touchscreen indicates the values ​​of pounds up 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.760
 100 km just like the distributor and it is 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.410
 also able to report on 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.180
 navigator service stations with the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.950
 methane there is no key to switch 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.450
 from gasoline to gas or vice versa, the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.830
 machine automatically goes to methane e 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 only when the cylinders are empty 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.700
 commute gasoline 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.209
 the four-cylinder 1400 engine at the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.610
 turbo and 110 horses that are not many 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.170
 but the performances are not too much 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.270
 different from those of a 1600 turbodiesel 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.060
 so more than good 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.530
 goes from 0 to 100 in 10.9 seconds but is the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.080
 answer the best aspect because 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.000
 the couple really smooth very smooth 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 maximum of 200 newton meters is 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.190
 available already at 1,500 rpm and thrust 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.739
 the turbo arrives progressively 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.280
 linear six-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.440
 then it is super smooth to maneuver and ai 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 reports that allow you to hold the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.220
 engine always in the best area of 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.590
 operation 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.110
 pulling the gears above 4,000 rpm there 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 would like more extension and even a little 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.569
 more shooting uphill or full 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.420
 load 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.739
 but in reality you never know the feeling 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.080
 that the engine is undersized 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.299
 Also the noise and really 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.880
 contained and then better to drive with 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.890
 high and relaxed gears and let it work 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.690
 the trim of 16 which is comfortable but 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 however it allows to deal with 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.459
 decision the curves also because there is not 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.890
 absolutely notices about 65 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.920
 extra pounds of gas cylinders 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:50.120
 the steering is not particularly sporty 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:51.650
 but precise enough and homogeneous as 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.420
 on the other golf the intuitiveness of the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.920
 steering wheel controls and can be improved 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.810
 cylinders are well integrated into the floor 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.489
 the maximum however would have been if not 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.049
 they had removed trunk space 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.850
 although as we have seen the compartment of 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.380
 load remains well exploitable and not 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.609
 it would have been bad to even have some 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.870
 liter less in the tank of the 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.880
 gasoline to increase autonomy 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.609
 passable traveling methane that 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.049
 realistically of 300 350 kilometers e 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.880
 this is the distance you can do 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.470
 with a full considering the consumption in 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.060
 media is quietly around 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.859
 five kilos over 100 km 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.810
 also driving cheerfully produced in 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.910
 money to do 100 km you spend about 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.220
 5 euros against the 8 of a car 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.979
 comparable to lpg the 10 of a diesel i 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.720
 15 of a gasoline or the 9 euros of one 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.000
 hybrid with lower CO2 emissions 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.220
 declared 94 grams per km with change 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.500
 manual 92 with the automatic in double 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.340
 dsg 7-speed clutch available as 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.960
 optional for those looking for comfort 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.280
 driving methane being able to travel between 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.930
 the other also with traffic blocks 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.699
 and with a euro 6 engine 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.260
 these are the advantages of methane if 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.970
 you have distributors at your fingertips 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.710
 in short it seems that there are not 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.340
 more than once the machines at least 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.900
 methane 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.610
 proves that a customer on 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.350
 three of the golf chose this 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.510
 gas version starting from a price list 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.150
 of 21,300 euros that with the eco bonus 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.919
 volkswagen and down from 19,000 and 4 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.940
 even in your opinion the machines in the middle do not 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.620
 have nothing to envy to 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.910
 so-called normal cars 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.860
