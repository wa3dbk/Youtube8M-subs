00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.320
 Berlin but it was all clear 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.810
 especially the Ruhr lime content 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.820
 what he had 3 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
 stÃ¶ the tea drinkers especially 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.779
 I want to demonstrate this to you today 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.119
 we compare generally 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 of normal tap water were hail 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.150
 Westfalia in the water flows Chile shaken 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.450
 also the quality 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 but one saves a fox 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.910
 First, I want you Israel 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.350
 which residues 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.630
 By law and 5 4 liters normal both claim tap water too 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.900
 receive 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
 they proudly yellowish Bonner plaque 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 around the floor is that the location is pointing 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.580
 Residues they are now splashed by the massive use of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.760
 come out 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.010
 and percent 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 8th 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.380
 You are here 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.860
 as learned further water 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.610
 which cloudy broth has formed there, they now want to a water tank 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.550
 Disconnect the softie 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.630
 I think 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.660
 that is not so good 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.210
 I'll give it the basis 2t once with the normal tap water 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.620
 and one prepared with distilled water 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.860
 Demonstrate and you will wonder how strong the scalp effect 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 Series concentrated of four liters of water 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.510
 he let in one leg say politics 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.130
 Furry out 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.340
 I bet there are these two routes that are the same with the producer 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.970
 amount 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.860
 Percent Black Take are filled 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.160
 pour in tap water on the left side and on the right side 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
 distilled water 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
 now is a good thing to do 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 coming 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.719
 Here is the oldest of its kind 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.409
 and both teams finish the match 7 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.589
 two minutes 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.709
 okay theft for now Keys on the last project day 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.519
 Catania with the tap water 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.869
 made without and pushed him to the ground 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.259
 illustrating Clinton Klaas 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.649
 APA off 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.099
 Besides 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.660
 was made either with distilled water h 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.019
 and you could already clearly see that there are a few differences 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.199
 Catania was made with distilled water 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.959
 Fluck noticeably brighter 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.649
 while the other part of my own Mero arrangements set the tone 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.169
 gets and indeed very high 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.499
 clearly darker 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.989
 as the tiger made with distilled water 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.739
 how do you see yourself clearly again? 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.929
 but the line network will do something darker place authors 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.729
 right a trader Clara do 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.349
 with targeted water 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.949
 at the taste test RTT he was now prepared with the after my 1 water 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.700
 on 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.059
 something 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.080
 since 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.540
 to taste 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.569
 at the tee off 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.689
 while the TB was made with the designated master 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.389
 in Rheine 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.429
 to let 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.839
 If you are used to tap water you can start 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:59.979
 yourself 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.979
 Engelke does not taste as intense as bandage 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.039
 green teas become the intense flavor notes 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.559
 much stronger 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.969
 and by using this stuff in the cold and by all a short 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.619
 by distillation of cold water 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:20.019
 be clear try it out to win the victory yourself
