00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
just for everyone else but this watch is

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.379 
just for everyone else but this watch is
was<00:00:48.699> basically<00:00:49.120> designed<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.780> survive<00:00:50.109> shock

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
water vibrations just a lot of very

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.729 
water vibrations just a lot of very
harsh<00:01:01.569> things<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.229> would<00:01:02.379> just<00:01:02.530> destroy

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
harsh things that would just destroy

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.490 
harsh things that would just destroy
other<00:01:03.339> watches<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:03.940> make<00:01:04.360> them<00:01:04.540> stop<00:01:04.870> also

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
other watches or make them stop also

very highly anti-magnetic the movement

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.170 
very highly anti-magnetic the movement
in<00:01:09.159> here<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:11.159> suspended<00:01:12.159> it's<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.640> twenty<00:01:13.030> eight

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
in here is suspended it's a twenty eight

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.690 
in here is suspended it's a twenty eight
thirty<00:01:13.600> six<00:01:14.079> which<00:01:14.710> has<00:01:14.890> been<00:01:15.070> chronometer

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
thirty six which has been chronometer

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.679 
thirty six which has been chronometer
certified<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.979> suspended<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.610> material<00:01:19.299> so

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
certified and suspended in a material so

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.450 
certified and suspended in a material so
that<00:01:19.719> it<00:01:19.899> can<00:01:20.140> really<00:01:20.320> absorb<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.950> lot<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.130> shock

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
that it can really absorb a lot of shock

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.039 
that it can really absorb a lot of shock
so<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.759> can<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.420> really<00:01:22.750> move<00:01:22.869> this

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
so you can you can really move this

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.779 
so you can you can really move this
watch<00:01:23.200> around<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.649> lot<00:01:23.859> and<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.189> will<00:01:24.310> totally

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
watch around a lot and it will totally

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.999 
watch around a lot and it will totally
be<00:01:25.090> fine<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:26.079> can<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> movement<00:01:26.950> in

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
be fine you can see the movement in

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.859 
be fine you can see the movement in
there<00:01:27.159> it's<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:27.609> difficult<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.390> see<00:01:28.630> on<00:01:28.659> that

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
there it's it's difficult to see on that

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.230 
there it's it's difficult to see on that
in<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.170> video<00:01:29.439> but<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.520> edges<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:31.060> there

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
in the video but in the edges of there

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.929 
in the video but in the edges of there
if<00:01:31.329> you<00:01:31.390> look<00:01:31.539> closely<00:01:31.840> you'll<00:01:32.170> see<00:01:32.729> sort<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.850> a

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
if you look closely you'll see sort of a

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.039 
if you look closely you'll see sort of a
little<00:01:34.149> bit<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.420> believe<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.869> red

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
little bit of I believe it's a red

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.539 
little bit of I believe it's a red
material<00:01:35.469> which<00:01:35.859> is<00:01:36.009> sort<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.250> what<00:01:36.460> is

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
the movement is very nicely decorated

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.819 
the movement is very nicely decorated
you<00:01:42.429> have<00:01:42.609> this<00:01:42.759> nice<00:01:43.329> customized<00:01:44.109> black

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
you have this nice customized black

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.959 
you have this nice customized black

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
the movement which is which is quite

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.800 
the movement which is which is quite
nice<00:01:53.710> there's<00:01:54.579> more<00:01:54.850> than<00:01:55.060> likely<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.659> to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
nice there's more than likely going to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.440 
nice there's more than likely going to
be<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.960> version<00:01:56.259> with<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> solid<00:01:57.100> case<00:01:57.340> back<00:01:57.700> so

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
be a version with a solid case back so

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.419 
be a version with a solid case back so
that<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.749> can<00:01:58.899> be<00:01:59.079> totally<00:01:59.469> anti<00:01:59.799> magnetic

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
that it can be totally anti magnetic

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.989 
that it can be totally anti magnetic
it's<00:02:01.179> really<00:02:01.479> not<00:02:01.600> possible<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.920> full<00:02:03.609> anti

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
it's really not possible to do full anti

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.630 
it's really not possible to do full anti
magnetism<00:02:04.479> when<00:02:05.109> you<00:02:05.200> have<00:02:05.409> an<00:02:05.530> exposed<00:02:05.979> case

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
prototype version there's gonna be some

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.790 
prototype version there's gonna be some
changes<00:02:10.020> these<00:02:11.020> crowns<00:02:11.319> they<00:02:11.590> are<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.740> to

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
should also be available I also forgot

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.270 
should also be available I also forgot
to<00:03:53.980> mention<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.959> dual<00:03:56.280> Direction

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
to mention the the dual Direction

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
rotating in inner bezel there which

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.210 
rotating in inner bezel there which
works<00:04:01.239> really<00:04:01.449> nicely<00:04:01.919> and<00:04:02.919> that's<00:04:03.040> for

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
works really nicely and that's for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.710 
works really nicely and that's for
various<00:04:03.519> types<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.819> timing<00:04:04.209> functions

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
various types of timing functions

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.680 
various types of timing functions
because<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:05.799> an<00:04:05.949> aviator<00:04:06.370> watch<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:07.030> goes

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
because it's an aviator watch it goes

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.990 
because it's an aviator watch it goes
both<00:04:07.959> ways<00:04:08.019> as<00:04:08.560> opposed<00:04:08.919> to<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.459> diver's

both ways as opposed to a a diver's

both ways as opposed to a a diver's
watch<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.900> what<00:04:11.500> would<00:04:11.680> only<00:04:11.859> go<00:04:12.129> one<00:04:12.370> way

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
watch that what would only go one way

watch that what would only go one way
price<00:04:13.660> for<00:04:13.900> watches<00:04:14.379> like<00:04:14.560> this<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.949> probably

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
price for watches like this is probably

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:22.129 
price for watches like this is probably
in<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:18.780> 3,500<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.930> 4,000<00:04:20.799> dollar<00:04:21.010> range

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
in the 3,500 to 4,000 dollar range

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.930 
in the 3,500 to 4,000 dollar range
that's<00:04:23.139> that's<00:04:23.949> more<00:04:24.190> or<00:04:24.310> less<00:04:24.460> been<00:04:24.729> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
that's that's more or less been the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.820 
that's that's more or less been the
range<00:04:25.150> for<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.479> martin-baker<00:04:25.990> ones<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.770> I

range for the martin-baker ones and I

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.110 
range for the martin-baker ones and I
believe<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.280> commit

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
believe is commit

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.110 
believe is commit
for<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:28.479> because<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.919> not<00:04:30.120> released

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
for this because this is not released

for this because this is not released
yet<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.449> this<00:04:31.510> is<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.690> prototype<00:04:32.199> version<00:04:32.229> we

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
these made available and it really is a

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.960 
these made available and it really is a
great<00:04:41.500> timepiece<00:04:41.800> Brehme<00:04:42.430> does<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.639> great<00:04:42.910> job

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
great timepiece Brehme does a great job

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.350 
great timepiece Brehme does a great job
with<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.600> design<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:45.070> at<00:04:45.550> first<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.180> might

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
with the design and at first it might

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.700 
with the design and at first it might
not<00:04:46.570> look<00:04:46.690> like<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.990> most<00:04:47.080> exciting<00:04:47.500> thing

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
not look like the most exciting thing

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.400 
not look like the most exciting thing
but<00:04:48.490> they<00:04:48.850> did<00:04:49.090> everything<00:04:49.570> right<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.139> loom

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
but they did everything right the loom

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.879 
but they did everything right the loom
is<00:04:50.620> excellent<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:52.260> legibility<00:04:53.260> is<00:04:53.290> good<00:04:53.620> I

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
is excellent the legibility is good I

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.640 
is excellent the legibility is good I
like<00:04:54.100> how<00:04:54.520> for<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.850> day<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.419> date<00:04:55.690> they

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
like how for the day and the date they

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.250 
like how for the day and the date they
did<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.949> black<00:04:57.270> disks<00:04:58.270> with<00:04:58.449> white<00:04:58.660> font<00:04:59.050> to

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
did it black disks with white font to

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.460 
did it black disks with white font to
match<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.610> they<00:05:00.760> really<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.870> brand<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.440> a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
match it so they really the brand is a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.510 
match it so they really the brand is a
very<00:05:03.780> detail-oriented<00:05:04.780> brand<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:06.340> even

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
very detail-oriented brand and even

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.150 
very detail-oriented brand and even
though<00:05:06.820> this<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> very<00:05:07.510> durable<00:05:07.840> watch<00:05:08.260> and

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
though this is a very durable watch and

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.020 
though this is a very durable watch and
I<00:05:09.190> don't<00:05:09.250> know<00:05:09.520> if<00:05:09.580> this<00:05:09.699> will<00:05:09.820> be<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
I don't know if this will be on the

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.610 
I don't know if this will be on the
production<00:05:10.360> version<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.050> crown<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.590> not

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
production version but the crown is not

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.879 
production version but the crown is not
screwing<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.580> even<00:05:12.910> though<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.120> has<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:14.050> pretty

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
screwing so even though it has a pretty

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.330 
screwing so even though it has a pretty
decent<00:05:15.070> level<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.520> water<00:05:15.760> resistance<00:05:17.340> exactly

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
decent level of water resistance exactly

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.830 
decent level of water resistance exactly
how<00:05:18.400> much<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.760> think<00:05:18.940> it's<00:05:19.060> at<00:05:19.150> least<00:05:19.270> 100

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
how much is I think it's at least 100

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
how much is I think it's at least 100
meters<00:05:20.400> will<00:05:21.400> check<00:05:21.639> on<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.880> back<00:05:22.060> there<00:05:22.860> yeah

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
meters will check on the back there yeah

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.360 
meters will check on the back there yeah
100<00:05:24.310> meters<00:05:25.350> it<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.590> don't<00:05:26.800> have<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.010> screw

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
100 meters it you don't have to screw

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.890 
100 meters it you don't have to screw
that<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.699> which<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:28.060> nice<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.539> it's<00:05:28.660> got<00:05:28.690> all
