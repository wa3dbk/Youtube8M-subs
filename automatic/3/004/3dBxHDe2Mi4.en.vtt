00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.460 
guys for watching we're gonna be posting
a<00:01:57.060> lot<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.420> black<00:01:57.659> ops<00:01:57.840> 2<00:01:58.020> glitches<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
a lot more black ops 2 glitches in the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.469 
a lot more black ops 2 glitches in the
future<00:01:58.830> hopefully<00:01:59.100> better<00:01:59.700> ones<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.210> but

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
future hopefully better ones in this but

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
future hopefully better ones in this but
it's<00:02:00.690> really<00:02:00.960> hard<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> maps<00:02:02.220> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it's really hard because all the maps on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's really hard because all the maps on
black<00:02:02.549> ops<00:02:02.729> 2<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:03.180> pretty<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.570> sky<00:02:03.810> buried

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
black ops 2 are pretty much sky buried

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.680 
black ops 2 are pretty much sky buried
so<00:02:04.409> there's<00:02:04.830> actually<00:02:05.009> too<00:02:05.490> many<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.390> maps

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so there's actually too many out of maps

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.760 
so there's actually too many out of maps
which<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.049> because<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.530> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
which is because they are really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.590 
which is because they are really
difficult<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.910> anyways<00:02:09.270> guys<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
difficult to do but anyways guys it's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.760 
difficult to do but anyways guys it's
pretty<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.929> hope<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> guys<00:02:10.229> enjoyed<00:02:10.590> and
