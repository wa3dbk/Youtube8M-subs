now that's the first point of our art

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.400 
now that's the first point of our art
our<00:02:01.140> next<00:02:01.590> point<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:02.970> be<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.420> circular

enter

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
enter

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.970 
enter
now<00:02:24.030> when<00:02:24.329> that<00:02:24.480> makes<00:02:24.719> it<00:02:24.930> blank<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.709> means

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
now when that makes it blank that means

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.979 
now when that makes it blank that means
at<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> point<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.329> selected<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
at that point that it just selected is

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.500 
at that point that it just selected is
an<00:02:28.170> invisible<00:02:28.560> point<00:02:29.129> so<00:02:29.819> basically<00:02:30.239> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
an invisible point so basically it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.509 
an invisible point so basically it's
going<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.719> go<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.230> point<00:02:31.469> prior<00:02:31.859> to<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
going to go from the point prior to the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.940 
going to go from the point prior to the
point<00:02:32.819> after<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.689> it's<00:02:34.349> still<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.799> keep

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
point after and it's still going to keep

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.679 
point after and it's still going to keep
that<00:02:35.189> other<00:02:35.400> point<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:35.969> middle<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.329> memory

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
that other point in the middle in memory

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.339 
that other point in the middle in memory
so<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.109> knows<00:02:37.290> where<00:02:37.469> to<00:02:37.590> make<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> arc

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
so it knows where to make the arc

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.690 
so it knows where to make the arc
we're<00:02:40.349> on<00:02:40.530> finding<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> last<00:02:41.189> point<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.579> our

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
we're on finding the last point of our

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:51.570 
we're on finding the last point of our
earth

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
no shift touch-up it'll be the last

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.690 
no shift touch-up it'll be the last
point<00:02:56.599> where<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.680> clear<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> workpiece

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
point where we can clear the workpiece

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.390 
point where we can clear the workpiece
and<00:02:59.060> move<00:02:59.330> over<00:02:59.540> linear<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.500> our<00:03:00.890> start<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.310> our

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
and move over linear to our start of our

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.100 
and move over linear to our start of our
next<00:03:01.670> art<00:03:02.380> turnover<00:03:03.380> feeder<00:03:03.709> a

this will be our point for the second
arc

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.140 

and<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:14.780> was<00:03:14.990> linear<00:03:15.710> from<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.520> last<00:03:16.760> point

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
and that was linear from that last point

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.470 
and that was linear from that last point
to<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:17.450> point

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.970 

once<00:03:22.840> again<00:03:22.990> we're<00:03:23.260> going<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.440> put<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> point

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
once again we're going to put the point

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.180 
once again we're going to put the point
as<00:03:24.190> an<00:03:24.340> as<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.940> linear<00:03:25.300> point<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.080> then<00:03:27.040> we're

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
as an as a linear point and then we're

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:40.100 
as an as a linear point and then we're
going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.340> change<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> circular<00:03:28.239> point

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.630 

you<00:03:40.680> can

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.670 

so<00:03:47.030> we'll<00:03:47.690> change<00:03:47.990> that<00:03:48.050> linear<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
so we'll change that linear to a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.610 
so we'll change that linear to a
circular<00:03:49.360> choice<00:03:51.460> entered<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.780> we<00:03:53.840> scroll

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
circular choice entered now we scroll

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.650 
circular choice entered now we scroll
down<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.160> then<00:03:55.310> enter<00:03:55.910> shift<00:03:56.180> touch<00:03:56.420> up

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
down and then enter shift touch up

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.990 
down and then enter shift touch up
because<00:03:56.870> I'm<00:03:56.990> at<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.290> last<00:03:57.470> point<00:03:58.000> shift

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
because I'm at that last point shift

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.540 
because I'm at that last point shift
seen<00:03:59.290> will<00:04:00.290> clear<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.710> now<00:04:01.280> we'll<00:04:01.430> go<00:04:01.520> back

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
seen will clear that now we'll go back

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.600 
seen will clear that now we'll go back
to<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.940> robot<00:04:02.300> and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
to the robot and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.670 

so<00:04:05.120> for<00:04:05.450> our<00:04:05.480> next<00:04:05.570> linear<00:04:06.080> points<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.560> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
so for our next linear points to the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.809 
so for our next linear points to the
next<00:04:06.980> curve

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
next curve

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.360 
next curve
it'll<00:04:09.689> create<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.080> point<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> start<00:04:11.280> of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it'll create this point in the start of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.370 
it'll create this point in the start of
our<00:04:11.430> arc<00:04:12.829> enter<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:15.120> our<00:04:15.629> last<00:04:15.840> hour<00:04:16.109> I'll

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
our arc enter and our last hour I'll

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.120 
our arc enter and our last hour I'll
show<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:17.370> different<00:04:18.180> move

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.220 

of<00:04:21.550> the<00:04:21.730> termination<00:04:22.330> time<00:04:22.510> you're<00:04:23.020> going<00:04:23.170> to

of the termination time you're going to
try<00:04:23.440> it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
try it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.529 
try it
in<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.020> man

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:37.499 

I'm<00:04:29.749> going<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> continuous<00:04:30.439> on<00:04:30.830> network

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
change that one over to a circular move

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.359 
change that one over to a circular move
again<00:04:48.009> choice

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:53.369 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:55.769 

he's<00:04:54.369> going<00:04:54.549> to<00:04:54.610> change<00:04:54.819> it<00:04:54.969> in<00:04:55.059> no<00:04:55.209> continuous

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:55.779 
he's going to change it in no continuous

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.409 
he's going to change it in no continuous
move

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419

CNT after 100
all<00:05:16.870> right<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.229> basically<00:05:17.409> what<00:05:17.800> we're<00:05:17.979> doing

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
all right so basically what we're doing

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.499 
all right so basically what we're doing
is<00:05:18.280> we're<00:05:18.430> turning<00:05:18.729> this<00:05:18.819> into<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.150> continuous

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
is we're turning this into a continuous

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.450 
is we're turning this into a continuous
move<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.229> way<00:05:20.349> there's<00:05:20.560> no<00:05:20.770> points<00:05:21.280> in

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
move that way there's no points in

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.730 
move that way there's no points in
between<00:05:21.580> it'll<00:05:22.569> actually<00:05:22.780> just<00:05:23.020> sweep

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
between it'll actually just sweep

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:45.390 
between it'll actually just sweep
through<00:05:24.129> the<00:05:24.280> turn<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:25.000> move<00:05:25.599> on

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.550 

it<00:05:46.030> shifts<00:05:46.449> touch<00:05:46.660> up<00:05:46.900> it'll<00:05:47.199> be<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.350> last

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
it shifts touch up it'll be the last

00:05:47.560 --> 00:06:07.120 
it shifts touch up it'll be the last
move<00:05:48.010> on<00:05:48.430> that<00:05:48.610> art

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.950 

once<00:06:07.670> again<00:06:07.850> we're<00:06:08.180> changing<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.660> linearity

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
once again we're changing the linearity

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:22.320 
once again we're changing the linearity
to<00:06:09.530> do<00:06:09.650> this<00:06:09.800> one<00:06:09.950> is<00:06:10.070> a<00:06:10.100> continuous

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.540 

all<00:06:22.750> right<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.379> the<00:06:23.560> bottom<00:06:23.740> two<00:06:24.129> are<00:06:24.310> going<00:06:24.490> to

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
all right so the bottom two are going to

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.420 
all right so the bottom two are going to
be<00:06:24.639> standard<00:06:25.060> circular<00:06:25.599> motions<00:06:26.110> and<00:06:26.379> the<00:06:27.069> top

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
be standard circular motions and the top

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.529 
be standard circular motions and the top
two<00:06:27.669> are<00:06:27.849> going<00:06:28.000> to<00:06:28.090> be<00:06:28.180> continuous<00:06:28.870> motions

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
two are going to be continuous motions

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.969 
two are going to be continuous motions
we're<00:06:31.539> going<00:06:31.659> to<00:06:31.720> go<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.870> our<00:06:32.050> last<00:06:32.289> point<00:06:32.710> on

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
we're going to go to our last point on

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.469 
we're going to go to our last point on
the<00:06:33.569> on<00:06:34.569> the<00:06:34.810> part<00:06:35.110> I<00:06:35.409> will<00:06:36.400> end<00:06:36.639> our<00:06:36.879> points<00:06:37.330> on

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
the on the part I will end our points on

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.689 
the on the part I will end our points on
the<00:06:37.599> part<00:06:37.840> and<00:06:38.139> now<00:06:38.919> we're<00:06:39.099> going<00:06:39.220> to<00:06:39.280> return

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
the part and now we're going to return

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:54.870 
the part and now we're going to return
to<00:06:39.940> a<00:06:39.970> home<00:06:40.659> setting<00:06:42.150> away<00:06:43.150> from<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.539> part

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.850 

okay<00:06:55.880> alright<00:06:56.840> now<00:06:56.870> we're<00:06:57.230> going<00:06:57.320> to<00:06:57.380> attempt

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
okay alright now we're going to attempt

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:06.149 
okay alright now we're going to attempt
to<00:06:57.950> run<00:06:58.730> our<00:06:58.940> program

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:06.159 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.060 

I

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.060 

all<00:07:09.640> right<00:07:09.820> and<00:07:10.000> away<00:07:10.240> we<00:07:10.420> go<00:07:10.950> there's<00:07:11.950> the

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
all right and away we go there's the

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.110 
all right and away we go there's the
first<00:07:12.340> point<00:07:12.700> a<00:07:13.740> linear<00:07:14.740> move<00:07:15.040> to<00:07:15.250> the<00:07:15.340> ark<00:07:15.550> the

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
first point a linear move to the ark the

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.440 
first point a linear move to the ark the
ark<00:07:16.150> itself<00:07:17.400> linear<00:07:18.400> move<00:07:18.670> to<00:07:18.880> the<00:07:19.000> second<00:07:19.300> R

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
ark itself linear move to the second R

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.350 
ark itself linear move to the second R
I'm<00:07:19.960> going<00:07:20.050> to<00:07:20.200> stop<00:07:20.410> what<00:07:20.620> we<00:07:20.770> are<00:07:21.180> now<00:07:22.180> we're

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
I'm going to stop what we are now we're

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.970 
I'm going to stop what we are now we're
going<00:07:22.450> to<00:07:22.510> do<00:07:22.600> the<00:07:22.750> continuous<00:07:23.290> move<00:07:23.560> through

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
going to do the continuous move through
