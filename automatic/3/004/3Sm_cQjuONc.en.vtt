the flinch it's pretty strong there's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770

not<00:01:37.650> too<00:01:37.799> many<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.479> think

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
not too many other I don't I don't think

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
not too many other I don't I don't think
there<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.930> any<00:01:40.320> other<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.729> or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
there is any other that there's one or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.039 
there is any other that there's one or
two<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.189> did<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.570> flinch<00:01:45.570> stun

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
two I think that also did a flinch stun

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
two I think that also did a flinch stun
or<00:01:46.079> flinch<00:01:46.770> something<00:01:47.220> else<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.700> time

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
or flinch something else the same time

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
or flinch something else the same time
but<00:01:48.450> yeah<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> flinch<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.579> definitely<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
but yeah the flinch is definitely one of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
but yeah the flinch is definitely one of
the<00:01:50.909> strongest<00:01:51.329> things<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:51.840> combined<00:01:52.229> with

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the strongest things when combined with

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
the strongest things when combined with
a<00:01:52.439> stun<00:01:53.240> because<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> stunt<00:01:54.570> could<00:01:54.720> actually

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
a stun because the stunt could actually

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
a stun because the stunt could actually
it's<00:01:55.200> someone<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.710> line<00:01:56.390> so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's someone in the back line so

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.999 
it's someone in the back line so
arranged<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.250> hit<00:01:59.369> by<00:01:59.549> his<00:01:59.759> done<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
arranged can get hit by his done and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.810 
arranged can get hit by his done and
everyone<00:02:02.009> else<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> take

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
everyone else is just going to take

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
everyone else is just going to take
flinch<00:02:03.180> damage<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.530> he's<00:02:05.009> pretty<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.399> just

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
flinch damage so he's pretty much just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.910 
flinch damage so he's pretty much just
going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> put<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.299> out<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> fight

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
going to put people out of the fight

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to put people out of the fight
while<00:02:07.920> doing<00:02:08.160> damage<00:02:08.489> while<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:09.090> team's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
nice

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.380 
nice
on<00:02:13.310> top<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.700> fact<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:13.970> he<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.270> defense

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
on top of the fact that he is a defense

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.180 
on top of the fact that he is a defense
he's<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:17.870> really<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.620> weighing<00:02:18.860> for

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
he's just like really in weighing for

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.760 
he's just like really in weighing for
the<00:02:19.280> enemy<00:02:19.520> team<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> handle<00:02:20.050> because<00:02:21.050> his

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the enemy team to handle because his

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.820 
the enemy team to handle because his
defense<00:02:22.010> he's<00:02:22.700> got<00:02:22.880> more<00:02:23.060> armor<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.320> he's<00:02:24.620> not

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
defense he's got more armor so he's not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.410 
defense he's got more armor so he's not
going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.010> die<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.340> fast<00:02:25.580> he<00:02:25.820> might<00:02:26.030> even<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
going to die as fast he might even get a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.700 
going to die as fast he might even get a
skill<00:02:26.720> off<00:02:26.870> twice<00:02:27.200> sometimes<00:02:29.710> you're

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
skill off twice sometimes you're

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.790 
skill off twice sometimes you're
probably<00:02:30.920> gonna<00:02:31.130> run<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> want<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> run<00:02:32.360> him<00:02:32.540> on

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
probably gonna run a want to run him on

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.480 
probably gonna run a want to run him on
one<00:02:33.850> three<00:02:34.850> or<00:02:35.060> four<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.710> he's<00:02:36.950> with<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
one three or four just so he's with the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.530 
one three or four just so he's with the
the<00:02:37.790> big<00:02:37.970> group<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.570> guys<00:02:40.180> unless<00:02:41.180> like

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the big group of you guys unless like

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.880 
the big group of you guys unless like
there's<00:02:41.840> probably<00:02:42.140> some<00:02:42.380> special

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
there's probably some special

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.320 
there's probably some special
circumstances<00:02:43.640> where<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.880> wouldn't<00:02:44.060> run<00:02:44.240> in

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
circumstances where you wouldn't run in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.360 
circumstances where you wouldn't run in
there<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.320> probably<00:02:45.620> definitely<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.340> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
there but I probably definitely want to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.210 
there but I probably definitely want to
run<00:02:46.520> him<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.730> space<00:02:47.060> one<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:48.320> arena<00:02:48.740> because

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
run him on space one on arena because

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.970 
run him on space one on arena because
he'll<00:02:50.060> he'll<00:02:50.420> get<00:02:50.600> targeted<00:02:50.810> first<00:02:51.290> most<00:02:51.830> of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
he'll he'll get targeted first most of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.750 
he'll he'll get targeted first most of
the<00:02:52.040> time<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.460> he<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.300> tank<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.730> he'll<00:02:55.730> uh

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
the time and he is a tank so he'll uh

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.250 
the time and he is a tank so he'll uh
he'll<00:02:56.660> just<00:02:56.900> eat<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.560> enemy<00:02:57.890> team<00:02:59.260> while

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
he'll just eat the enemy team while

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.990 
he'll just eat the enemy team while
they're<00:03:00.440> focusing<00:03:00.950> him<00:03:01.160> they're<00:03:01.610> not<00:03:01.880> gonna

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
decent but the defense was definitely

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.410 
decent but the defense was definitely
pretty<00:03:13.760> strong<00:03:14.210> on<00:03:14.420> him<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> he's<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.360> a

Avengers is probably better because

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.190 
Avengers is probably better because
you're<00:05:05.780> getting<00:05:05.900> more<00:05:06.320> stats<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.960> crowd
