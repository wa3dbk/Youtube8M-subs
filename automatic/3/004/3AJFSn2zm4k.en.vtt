00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 Speak up , guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 is here on the motor of the field is she 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.980
 started with a flaw presented a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 failed this morning and soon we suspect 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 that she's already sailing 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.490
 she was in trouble in the car 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.699
 people already make the exchange of the first candle 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.769
 of the right cylinder you can 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.160
 to see that the state gives of her she was 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.420
 o the point of who she 's electrode 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 well contaminated with oil indicating that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.280
 is already having more than irregular burning 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.739
 there is already a little oil left over 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 within what is here is a new candle 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 and on the right side the steering wheel on the side 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.379
 left and right is new or 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.510
 vice versa 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.149
 and you can see the situation of each one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.489
 of the two it is a new village if 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.200
 an injection and how can you 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 see if she was already bad 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.540
 from this risk here that I grew up 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 way that generally the escape of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 hundreds of everything here and for the quality 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 the electrode it here too we 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.439
 plus we go fast tutorial 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
 for you as if exchanging a candle of one 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.759
 the engine p 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.030
 It's certain that we're going to change that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.400
 second cylinder now let's go 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.890
 first of all you have to own a 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.890
 candle wrench 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.490
 very hot put it in the corner 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.470
 usually the larger part in the case of 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 You're going to use candles. 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.869
 I always do it in the following way. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.940
 I leave this part here where it stops. 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.540
 Alone pointing always forward to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.479
 start taking as base a blind 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:18.910
 I'll come with the pin here so I can 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:22.269
 take it easy and start taking the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.550
 even though it is not a process that 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.720
 It needs a lot of victory for withdrawal. 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.720
 when she says it's easy 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.960
 a piece that I'm sorry for 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.960
 too much to the right tone of the team 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.850
 here we can see I do not know if the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.510
 camera will be able to focus right 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.550
 Let's see, it's only in focus here that she 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.290
 already has its signs of age 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.130
 despite the favela that is being renovated, there is no 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.730
 nor 30 thousand kilometers wheeled in the car 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.050
 she is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.860
 already with the points of serve of crust 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.680
 inside it 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.110
 her electrode, as well as 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.730
 charred for 11 new novel is 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.989
 practically and now we will put 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:36.160
 new sail new favela is a trick 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:36.160
 Electronic also the affection you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.790
 let's coming based on the subject 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.750
 the first novel kiosks with the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.520
 hand does not have to start squeezing there anymore 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.580
 direct with chopsticks realized she 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:08.320
 already confirm this I put it again in the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:12.040
 fifth turn and 90 degrees at 90 is not 360 Â° 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.690
 practically 180 with your appeal case 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:24.900
 I did not need very strong, I'll let him. 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.900
 always on that line that put Robinho 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.530
 I'm a little 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.970
 a dog now needs to change the others 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.970
 two yes but let's check the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:54.960
 result of two of them shifted to the league 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:58.919
 the engine is this, my personal engine is brand new 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.860
 sheet with two of them already exchanged missing 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.900
 replace the other two as well as giving a 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.490
 tips for you and folks 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.530
 how can you do a test for 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.000
 check if your sail in case already 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.210
 no longer works 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.010
 come on in case you have noticed 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.979
 a fault in your engine 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:22.520
 The most correct thing to do is take a 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:25.110
 sail cable decides here to get it right 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.900
 ask a second person there inside the 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.330
 Cool car car gives a no start 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.020
 for it to work but you put it with 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.479
 almost in touch here the candle with the good 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.950
 realizing if the spark at the time that 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.550
 appear in the key 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.580
 the cable and the coil are good 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.120
 the distributor if it took 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.729
 verified that there is no spark then 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.900
 you should already look for a defect here 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.880
 on the spark plug cable or on the right 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.130
 People have the candle as you can. 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:09.750
 realize it looks good but it's dirtier on the 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:11.460
 our case here with this order is more 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.380
 from here the candle we just took 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.630
 also the middle wire 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:26.430
 this past here she was with 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:28.800
 defect and contaminated rice may have 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.620
 helped you to change at least one day 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.240
 how to change the sail over time 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.210
 People are doing more on Twitter. 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.590
 I hope you all have 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.169
 liked the video 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.050
 that speech always liked 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:46.050
 of a like to help share our 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.400
 video and comment or your child some 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.889
 wrong process something of the kind 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.219
 personal beauty that is earned and then spoke 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.219
 a hug
