this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.920> rather<00:01:59.130> hot<00:02:00.530> let's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this is going to be rather hot let's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:19.550 
this is going to be rather hot let's
find<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.250> happens

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.420 

immediately<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:21.340> hate<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.849> kicking<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.659> I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
immediately the hate is kicking in I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.589 
immediately the hate is kicking in I
need<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> drink

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.479 

yep

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
yep

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.509 
yep
yes<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:30.760> rather<00:02:31.000> warm<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:33.069> tortilla

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
yes that's rather warm the tortilla

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.900 
yes that's rather warm the tortilla
helps<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.480> hold<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:35.200> hard<00:02:35.440> shell<00:02:36.129> altogether

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
helps to hold the hard shell altogether

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.050 
helps to hold the hard shell altogether
so<00:02:37.840> even<00:02:38.140> though<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.790> basically<00:02:39.790> breaking

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
so even though it's basically breaking

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.220 
so even though it's basically breaking
apart<00:02:40.330> inside<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.660> only<00:02:43.930> thing<00:02:44.080> I'm

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
apart inside there the only thing I'm

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.690 
apart inside there the only thing I'm
losing<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.920> lettuce<00:02:45.489> at<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.120> sides<00:02:47.700> so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
losing is the lettuce at the sides so

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.979 
losing is the lettuce at the sides so
I've<00:02:48.940> just<00:02:48.970> got<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.329> be<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.629> more<00:02:49.750> careful

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
I've just got to be a bit more careful

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.360 
I've just got to be a bit more careful
with<00:02:50.319> what<00:02:50.440> comes<00:02:50.709> out<00:02:50.920> at<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.010> end<00:02:53.129> but<00:02:54.129> so

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
with what comes out at the end but so

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
with what comes out at the end but so
far<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.329> quite<00:02:55.690> good<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:59.260> I'm<00:02:59.349> guessing

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
far this is quite good now I'm guessing

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.930 
far this is quite good now I'm guessing
that<00:02:59.890> there's<00:03:00.099> not<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> lot<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.519> difference

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
that there's not a lot of difference

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.509 
that there's not a lot of difference
between<00:03:01.359> this<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> recent<00:03:02.440> mix<00:03:02.980> fresh

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
between this and the recent mix fresh

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.690 
between this and the recent mix fresh
fresh<00:03:04.450> mix<00:03:04.720> whatever<00:03:04.959> they<00:03:05.140> call<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.700> offering

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
fresh mix whatever they call it offering

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.720 
fresh mix whatever they call it offering
from<00:03:06.879> KFC<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.750> similar<00:03:08.379> ingredients<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:09.609> this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
from KFC a similar ingredients to this

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.430

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
just that this is all wrapped

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.910 
just that this is all wrapped
differently<00:03:12.099> basically<00:03:13.200> yes<00:03:14.200> I'd<00:03:14.440> say<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
differently basically yes I'd say that

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.309 
differently basically yes I'd say that
the<00:03:15.099> heat<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.519> coming<00:03:15.700> from<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.660> zinger<00:03:16.989> Filip

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
the heat is coming from the zinger Filip

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.190 
the heat is coming from the zinger Filip
and<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.040> supercharged<00:03:18.640> sauce<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:20.109> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
and the supercharged sauce and the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.979 
and the supercharged sauce and the
tomato<00:03:20.620> salsa<00:03:20.890> salsa<00:03:21.400> adds<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:22.629> good

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
tomato salsa salsa adds a good

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.370 
tomato salsa salsa adds a good
complementary<00:03:23.769> balance<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.840> those<00:03:26.019> two

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
complementary balance to to those two

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.620 
complementary balance to to those two
just<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:27.040> touch<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.430> lettuce<00:03:27.730> not<00:03:28.209> too<00:03:28.450> much

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
just a touch of lettuce not too much

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:37.680 
just a touch of lettuce not too much
that's<00:03:28.989> quite<00:03:29.319> good<00:03:30.599> I'm<00:03:31.599> enjoying<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:36.690> 695

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that's quite good I'm enjoying this 695

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.360 
that's quite good I'm enjoying this 695
I<00:03:37.959> think<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.349> good<00:03:38.560> price<00:03:38.769> considering

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
I think is a good price considering

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.909 
I think is a good price considering
there's<00:03:39.819> two<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.120> these<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:40.930> very<00:03:41.620> similar

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
there's two of these it is very similar

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.460 
there's two of these it is very similar
to<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.849> fresh<00:03:43.180> mix<00:03:43.419> this<00:03:43.900> has<00:03:44.019> got<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.319> one

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
to that fresh mix this has got the one

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.770 
to that fresh mix this has got the one
large<00:03:44.919> corn<00:03:45.370> taco<00:03:45.940> rather<00:03:46.269> than<00:03:46.630> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
large corn taco rather than the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.259 
large corn taco rather than the
individual<00:03:47.260> corn<00:03:47.560> chips<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> mix<00:03:49.030> fresh

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
individual corn chips of the mix fresh

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.460 
individual corn chips of the mix fresh
