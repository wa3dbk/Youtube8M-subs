at<00:01:11.070> home<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.520> Texas<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.659> use

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
at home in Texas so that's what I use

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
at home in Texas so that's what I use
because<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.740> already<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.340> and

to<00:03:25.549> make<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:25.970> more<00:03:26.090> cohesive<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:26.930> I

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
to make it a little more cohesive so I

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.500 
to make it a little more cohesive so I
flip<00:03:27.230> my<00:03:27.410> hair<00:03:27.620> upside<00:03:27.860> down<00:03:28.310> make<00:03:29.180> sure<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.390> get

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
flip my hair upside down make sure I get

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.870 
flip my hair upside down make sure I get
the<00:03:29.840> bottom<00:03:30.200> part<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.640> all

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
the bottom part and that that's all

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.199 
the bottom part and that that's all
covered<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.769> this<00:03:33.769> just<00:03:34.100> helps<00:03:34.250> my<00:03:34.549> hair<00:03:34.850> be

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
covered and this just helps my hair be

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.960 
covered and this just helps my hair be
more<00:03:35.900> cohesive<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.830> last<00:03:37.069> longer<00:03:37.400> because

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
more cohesive and last longer because

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.349 
more cohesive and last longer because
it's<00:03:38.890> because<00:03:39.890> it's<00:03:40.070> moisturize<00:03:40.760> thoroughly

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
it's because it's moisturize thoroughly

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's because it's moisturize thoroughly
together<00:03:42.079> as<00:03:42.410> one

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.590 

so<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> take<00:03:50.190> everything<00:03:50.640> all<00:03:50.790> over<00:03:50.819> again<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
so I take everything all over again the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.140 
so I take everything all over again the
leave<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.200> oil<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.770> spyler<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.880> i<00:03:54.090> do
