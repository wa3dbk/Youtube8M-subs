00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
notice how the the tubes are wired

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.570 
notice how the the tubes are wired
inversely<00:00:20.510> in<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:20.840> case<00:00:21.100> based<00:00:22.100> on<00:00:22.400> the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
inversely in this case based on the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.359 
inversely in this case based on the
location<00:00:23.119> of<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.570> carbs<00:00:24.020> sink<00:00:26.950> this<00:00:27.950> is<00:00:28.160> how<00:00:28.340> I

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
location of the carbs sink this is how I

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.689 
location of the carbs sink this is how I
have<00:00:28.700> my<00:00:32.379> gas<00:00:33.379> tank<00:00:33.559> shimmied<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.430> stuff

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
these are how they're all wired up to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
these are how they're all wired up to
the<00:00:38.989> respective<00:00:41.110> carbs<00:00:43.300> let's<00:00:44.300> fire<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.600> up

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.830 

right<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.290> running<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.620> about<00:01:32.840> twelve

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
right now it's running at about twelve

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.399 
right now it's running at about twelve
fifty<00:01:34.200> rpm<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.920> three

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.070 

1300<00:01:38.340> rpm<00:01:39.170> notice<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.479> pretty<00:01:42.479> wide<00:01:42.720> I

1300 rpm notice that the pretty wide I

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.670 
1300 rpm notice that the pretty wide I
think<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.340> 4000<00:01:45.030> rpm<00:01:45.479> let<00:01:46.440> me<00:01:46.530> hit

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
think them at about 4000 rpm let me hit

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.740 
think them at about 4000 rpm let me hit
it<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.860> four<00:01:47.040> thousand<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.670> seat
