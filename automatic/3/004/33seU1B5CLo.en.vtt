00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.480
 150 degree centigrade for fine hair 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.909
 or 200 degrees centigrade for thick hair 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.939
 you can make two kinds of meats 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.460
 more defined bunches 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 or looser natural clusters 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.420
 for more defined curls 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110
 separate a fine wick 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 position in the center of the profile of ceramics actor as the friezes for the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060
 top side 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.850
 slang acting in 180 degree clockwise movements 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 causing the beads to remain in contact with the hair 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 slide slowly gently 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.470
 until the end of the night 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 and for looser natural curls 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.160
 I repeat the same procedure as before 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 separating a strand more I liked 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.780
 hebe chile found himself faster 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.930
 until the end of the night 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.580
 for greater durability of the bunches with the police a little respect and gives me 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.310
 a kiss 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 before using the weapons 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.290
 when you finish all charges 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.119
 vaporize women for him 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.720
 all hair 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.110
 the curls that form 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 the technological tax 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.710
 aimed at the plate 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.440
 what is offered 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.460
 the dismissal of cuca and the negatives 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.510
 the profile of a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.560
 one inch 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.840
 and I follow and resistance of ceramics 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 hugo 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.650
 all that added up 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.210
 resulting in 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 the highest quality
