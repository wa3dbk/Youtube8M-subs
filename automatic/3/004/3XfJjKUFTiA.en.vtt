00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 When you are skating, the mind goes blank and it seems that sometimes you are flying. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 HOCKEY IN THE HIMALAYA 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.100
 My name is Chamba Tsetan and I'm from Kargyam, which is located in the east of Ladakh. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 Ladakh is located in northwestern India. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 In the Himalayas 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Here we find people of diverse origins. There are some east of Ladakh 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.000
 my region, originating from Tibet and China. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 Other people are from the Nubra Valley, originally from Baltistan. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 There is a majority of Buddhists and then Muslims. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 BY GENERATIONS LADAKH HAS BEEN A DISPUTED REGION 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 THERE ARE FREQUENT DISPUTES BETWEEN INDIA, CHINA AND PAKISTAN FOR THE REGION. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 THE AREA HAS A HISTORICAL AND STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Ladakh is the only part of India with ice and hockey for long periods of time. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
 That's the reason why we play hockey here and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 It has been said that hockey started with the army. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 They started with hockey in Ladakh. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 IN THE FIRST YEARS OF THE 70 AN INFANTRY OF THE HINDU ARMY, THE EXPLORERS OF LADAKH, WAS PARKED IN THE HIGH AREAS OF THE BORDER. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 AS A HAPPY TIME THEY BEGAN TO SKATE AND PLAY HOCKEY. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 THE LEGEND SAYS THAT THEIR OWN SKATES WERE MADE BY SCREWING BLADES TO THEIR BOOTS. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
 I thought hockey was pretty dangerous, you know. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.000
 When I saw my seniors circling 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.500
 I was curious to learn hockey 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.000
 and sometimes fly, as it seems 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 AT 20 YEARS OF AGE, CHAMBA IS THE CAPTAIN OF HIS LOCAL JUNIOR TEAM, THE LALOK ICE HOCKEY CLUB. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Here Lalok attacks, he needs another goal to be sure! 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Shoot! Another goal for Lalok! 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Okay guys, let's be active and play as a team. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.200
 Change with him in the second line and play your roll. 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 They are a tough team so we play hard as we train on the lake. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 Be prepared, come on! 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I started playing hockey only 5 years ago, in 2009 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.000
 when I was here at SECMOL as an associate student. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.700
 SECMOL is an NGO, an organization that used to work with the government 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.200
 to reform the education system in Ladakh 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.200
 and build schools in remote areas. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 CHAMBA CAME TO THE SECMOL FOR ONE YEAR AFTER SUSPENDING THE 10TH COURSE IN THE STATE SECONDARY SCHOOL. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 THE IBA COURSE FOCUSED ON THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF STUDENTS WHO COULD NOT HAVE LEARNED IN THE STATE SYSTEM. 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 THE HOCKEY ON ICE IS A COMPULSORY PART OF THE PROGRAM FOR BOYS AND GIRLS WHO COME TO THE SECMOL. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.500
 Some of the life lessons you get from hockey are 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 leadership, teamwork and discipline, which is needed while you are playing. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.100
 SECMOL really takes people away from the problems 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.100
 because when they suspend in 10ยบ 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.100
 One of the few options is to go to the city and drive taxis. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.100
 THERE ARE FEW CAREER OPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT APPROVE THEIR STUDIES IN LADAKH. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.100
 THE MOST LUCKY FIND WORK AS TAXISTS. OTHERS ABUSE DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.200
 After leaving school, SECMOL helps them 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.000
 moving them away from these dangers, you know 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.000
 At the same time they learn life lessons 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.000
 because here on campus there are students who participate in all the activities. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 They make the ice rink. 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.200
 They prepare everything. 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.000
 They learn to live by themselves. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 I play of forward. 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.800
 The thing is that India does not have a good team 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.300
 and it will not be possible to have it in ten, fifteen years. 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.300
 This is the reason why my dream for the future is to finish my master's degree in biology 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.000
 and then to become a professor at the university 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 EVERY YEAR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES OF LADAKH SEN FIND IN THE CAPITAL OF LEH'S DISTRICT TO PLAY A TOURNAMENT. 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 IN THE SEMIFINALS OF THE TOURNAMENT THE CHAMBA TEAM, PREDOMINANTLY CHRISTIAN, PLAYED AGAINST KARGIL, A YOUNG TEAM OF MUSLIM ORIGIN. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 A GOAL IN THE 2ND PERIOD OF CHAMBA CLOSED THE VICTORY OF THE LALOK. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.000
 You learn to play as a team when you play a game. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 You meet different people, you make different friends. 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.000
 It is part of the sport. That's what you learn from hockey. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 EL LALOK FINISHED IN 2nd PLACE OF THE TOURNAMENT. 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.600
 CURRENTLY CHAMBA IS A MENTOR IN SECMOL, TEACHING SPORT THAT LOVES A NEW GENERATION OF STUDENTS.
