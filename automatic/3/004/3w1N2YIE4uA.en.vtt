because<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.709> waterproof

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
because this is actually a waterproof

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.860 
because this is actually a waterproof
phone<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.820> we've<00:03:42.000> got<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> little<00:03:42.329> cover<00:03:42.600> there

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
phone so we've got a little cover there

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.539 
phone so we've got a little cover there
for<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.500> think<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:46.160> that's<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.310> SIM

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
for I think that is the that's the SIM

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.699 
for I think that is the that's the SIM
card<00:03:47.579> slot<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.750> side<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.230> would<00:03:49.470> imagine

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
card slot on that side I would imagine

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
card slot on that side I would imagine
and<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:50.790> across<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> top<00:03:51.360> we've<00:03:51.750> got<00:03:51.900> yet

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
and then across the top we've got yet
