qualifying ended in in today we're

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.990 
qualifying ended in in today we're
looking<00:00:15.120> at<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> new<00:00:15.570> solo<00:00:16.230> queue<00:00:16.710> 900<00:00:17.220> now

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
looking at the new solo queue 900 now

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.689 
looking at the new solo queue 900 now
this<00:00:18.180> phone<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.900> quad-core<00:00:19.230> phone<00:00:19.619> comes<00:00:19.980> in

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
this phone is a quad-core phone comes in

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.540 
this phone is a quad-core phone comes in
with<00:00:21.029> Android<00:00:21.480> 4.2<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> box<00:00:22.710> let's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
with Android 4.2 out of the box let's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.070 
with Android 4.2 out of the box let's
take<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.689> hardware<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
take a look at the hardware and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.420 
take a look at the hardware and
benchmarks<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:25.949> gonna<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.310> off

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
benchmarks and we're gonna start off

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.620 
benchmarks and we're gonna start off
with<00:00:26.460> quadrant<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.269> gonna<00:00:27.420> take<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with quadrant and we're gonna take a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630 
with quadrant and we're gonna take a
look<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> system<00:00:28.980> information<00:00:29.429> says

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
look at what the system information says

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780 
look at what the system information says
about<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.179> device<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

720 by 1280 which is fairly nice with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639 
720 by 1280 which is fairly nice with
this<00:00:53.640> price<00:00:53.820> bracket<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
this price bracket if you look at the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
this price bracket if you look at the
GPU<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> power<00:00:56.699> VR<00:00:56.940> SGX<00:00:57.120> 504

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
GPU you can see is the power VR SGX 504

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
GPU you can see is the power VR SGX 504
MP<00:00:58.230> GPU<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.550> move<00:00:59.789> over<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
MP GPU and if we move over to the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
MP GPU and if we move over to the
sensors<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.800> few

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
sensors you can see we have just a few

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.429 
sensors you can see we have just a few
sensors<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> three<00:01:02.850> axis<00:01:03.210> accelerometer

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
sensors so the three axis accelerometer

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
sensors so the three axis accelerometer
the<00:01:04.439> proximity<00:01:04.890> sensor<00:01:05.220> light<00:01:06.090> sensor<00:01:06.689> the

the proximity sensor light sensor the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
the proximity sensor light sensor the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
orientation sensor and the three axis
magnetic<00:01:09.659> field<00:01:09.840> sensor<00:01:09.990> let's<00:01:10.890> run<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> volt

magnetic field sensor let's run a volt

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:24.260 
magnetic field sensor let's run a volt
test<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> score<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.180> like

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.230 

so<00:01:25.270> uncorrelated<00:01:25.570> device<00:01:26.020> cause<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:27.240> 4836

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
so uncorrelated device cause a 4836

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.820 
so uncorrelated device cause a 4836
which<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.689> fairly<00:01:28.900> nice<00:01:29.170> for<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.560> price

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830
