all we're interested in doing is finding
out<00:00:57.500> sounds<00:00:58.500> like<00:01:36.020> but<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.850> get<00:01:38.850> them<00:01:39.030> to

note on the piano and ask them to sing
the<00:01:44.490> note<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.140> jump<00:01:46.799> around<00:01:46.970> quite<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the note back and I jump around quite a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.050 
the note back and I jump around quite a
lot<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.170> sometimes<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.829> play<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.280> very<00:01:50.579> high<00:01:50.820> note

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lot so sometimes I play a very high note

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.069 
lot so sometimes I play a very high note
followed<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.200> low<00:01:52.439> note<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.869> then<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
followed by very low note and then you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
followed by very low note and then you
can<00:01:55.290> tell<00:01:55.530> how<00:01:55.710> quickly<00:01:56.009> their<00:01:56.549> ear<00:01:56.729> adjusts

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can tell how quickly their ear adjusts

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.520 
can tell how quickly their ear adjusts
to<00:01:57.630> hearing<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> difference<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.130> pitch<00:01:59.340> and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
to hearing the difference in pitch and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
to hearing the difference in pitch and
then<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.909> will<00:02:02.909> try<00:02:03.210> playing<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:03.960> than<00:02:03.990> one

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
then I will try playing more than one

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.300 
then I will try playing more than one
note<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.960> seeing<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> pick<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.860> say

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
note and seeing if they can pick out say

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
note and seeing if they can pick out say
the<00:02:08.489> middle<00:02:08.640> note<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.060> three<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> second

sorts<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> things<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.150> try<00:02:15.390> some

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
sorts of things and then we try some

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.220 
sorts of things and then we try some
memory<00:02:15.990> tests<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> them<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.450> rhythmical

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
memory tests one of them is rhythmical

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.850 
memory tests one of them is rhythmical

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
one and one is melodic one where you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.339 
one and one is melodic one where you
play<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.099> tune<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.450> see<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.780> they<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.140> sing

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it back to you from the memory and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.910

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.279 
organizing time for that reason that's
my<00:05:09.729> arms<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.860> um<00:05:12.150> so<00:05:13.150> I<00:05:13.180> went<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.050> tenor

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
my arms so um so I went to the tenor

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.960 
my arms so um so I went to the tenor
horn<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.800> then<00:05:14.889> when<00:05:15.100> my<00:05:15.220> arms<00:05:15.520> were<00:05:15.729> long

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
horn and then when my arms were long

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.140 
horn and then when my arms were long
enough<00:05:18.510> now<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:20.320> I'm<00:05:21.130> hoping<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.550> do<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:22.360> grade

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
enough now and I'm hoping to do a grade

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.760 
enough now and I'm hoping to do a grade
and<00:05:25.150> they'll<00:05:25.510> see<00:05:25.780> piano<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:31.620> think<00:05:32.620> they're

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
and they'll see piano I think they're

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.940 
and they'll see piano I think they're
also<00:05:32.919> they<00:05:33.460> learn<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.900> value<00:05:35.320> of<00:05:35.470> being<00:05:35.650> part

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
also they learn the value of being part

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.990 
also they learn the value of being part
of<00:05:36.099> a<00:05:36.220> team<00:05:37.169> and<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.260> often<00:05:38.560> use<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:39.130> analogy<00:05:39.220> of

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
of a team and I often use the analogy of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
of a team and I often use the analogy of
sport<00:05:41.520> about<00:05:42.520> this<00:05:42.760> because<00:05:43.060> they<00:05:43.810> are

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
sport about this because they are

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.020 
sport about this because they are
essentially<00:05:44.800> just<00:05:45.160> like<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.970> member<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
essentially just like a member of the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.400 
essentially just like a member of the
England<00:05:49.030> Football<00:05:49.389> team<00:05:49.419> or<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.050> rugby<00:05:50.380> team

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
England Football team or the rugby team

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.550 
England Football team or the rugby team
or<00:05:50.889> cricket<00:05:51.520> team<00:05:51.760> or<00:05:52.000> baseball<00:05:52.990> team<00:05:53.320> or

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
or cricket team or baseball team or

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.010 
or cricket team or baseball team or
whatever<00:05:53.919> team<00:05:54.250> it<00:05:54.430> might<00:05:54.610> be<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.750> that<00:05:55.780> if

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
whatever team it might be and that if

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.529 
whatever team it might be and that if
they<00:05:56.320> drop<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.800> ball<00:05:57.010> then<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.699> team<00:05:58.240> loses

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
they drop the ball then the team loses

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.689 
they drop the ball then the team loses
the<00:05:58.960> game<00:05:59.139> you<00:05:59.470> know<00:05:59.620> there's<00:05:59.949> a<00:06:00.010> strong<00:06:00.310> sense

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
the game you know there's a strong sense

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.210 
the game you know there's a strong sense
of<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:01.060> amongst<00:06:01.599> them<00:06:01.780> and<00:06:02.220> they're

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
of that amongst them and they're

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.439 
of that amongst them and they're
immensely<00:06:03.490> proud<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.210> what<00:06:04.360> they<00:06:04.539> do<00:06:05.250> I<00:06:06.449> think

immensely proud of what they do I think

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.629 
immensely proud of what they do I think
often<00:06:07.750> without<00:06:08.169> necessarily<00:06:08.740> realizing<00:06:09.490> it
