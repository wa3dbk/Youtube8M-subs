00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.989
 heating market water supply 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:04.880
 gas distribution supplemented goal yet 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.300
 one new interesting 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.360
 the material is corrugated 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.170
 stainless pipe which bends in 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.939
 different positions 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.579
 and very convenient and quick dock 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.859
 with various threaded fittings and 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.149
 in the dwelling of state acceptance of the fight has a very 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.309
 a wide range of applications for the anniversary 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.839
 standard science water supply systems 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.820
 heating systems ie radiator 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.120
 under floor heating systems thanks to 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.510
 but also their flexibility and plasticity 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.040
 installation takes a lot of time 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 heat transfer is not much higher than in 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.040
 various plastic pipes 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.319
 also applicable to systems 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.030
 gas distribution 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 still have a wide range and opinion you 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 fire specifics 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.730
 this system is automatic 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 fire extinguishing and has an unlimited period 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 services 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.190
 about people that is materials box 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.610
 propily detach status help corners 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.250
 he did not blame the scene 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.360
 metal plastic requires 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 springs either pipe bender too 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.100
 less plastic 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 stainless pipe bends in all 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.230
 provisions 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.380
 The propylene of this reservoir has its 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 boundary temperature in the area 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.170
 90 degrees 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.210
 and the copper woman's name the pipe already allows 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.670
 use higher 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 temperature but unlike copper 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.810
 installation in stainless corrugated pipes and 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 easy and quick 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.640
 for mounting heat polypropylene a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.160
 required firstly electricity 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.770
 secondly needed 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.400
 soldering 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.530
 for metal layer hell is no longer required 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.680
 shakes but you need a special tool that you 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.060
 press in clutch 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.920
 for copper pipes 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 required 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.079
 either burner 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 either special tool 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.959
 no stainless steel pipes required 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.000
 special tool 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.140
 wrench only 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.580
 hands taken simple tee 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 trumpet tightened nuts 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.269
 the connection is ready for you 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.709
 stainless tube has two kinds 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.299
 connections one world this grip basil 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.589
 opinions that do not require any 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.399
 special tools the second kind is 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.529
 pipe halters but if the bottom and nut are sitting 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.639
 trumpet 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.499
 is 6 flock pre 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.199
 and this place we have for you kissing 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.729
 using a special 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.389
 instruments 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.220
 to all 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.729
 this system is better 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.639
 here you can put paranich pili 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.149
 especially cardboard laying thereby 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.149
 the magnitude of the temperature limit 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.249
 it and pipes 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.659
 it is very relevant for the same 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.329
 bath systems 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.090
 when choosing the diameters of different corpse can 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.719
 leave 20 ti six millimeters 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.749
 plastic pipes quietly go to 25 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.119
 meters of stainless steel pipes and you get 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.339
 equivalent diameter is one of the few 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.799
 pipes which is allowed for gas 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.679
 liner 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.599
 can also make pointed flood 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.699
 any 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.209
 and any diameter 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.179
 really initiated tubes 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.809
 stainless steel is an excellent solution for 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.949
 installation of heating systems 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.939
 gas water supply systems 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.259
 fire extinguishing and underfloor heating always in 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.390
 the presence of pipes and all components 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.100
 with the score 2 1 in the match anji 2 were absolutely 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.309
 88 call by phone yekaterinburg
