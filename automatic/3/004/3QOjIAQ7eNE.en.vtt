okay<00:00:06.850> here's<00:00:07.149> how<00:00:07.210> Maya

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
okay here's how Maya

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.610 
okay here's how Maya
sensors<00:00:08.710> work<00:00:09.330> what<00:00:10.330> you<00:00:10.360> can<00:00:10.690> see<00:00:10.960> here<00:00:10.990> is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
sensors work what you can see here is

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.440 
sensors work what you can see here is
one<00:00:12.430> of<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:12.960> right<00:00:13.960> here<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.500> one<00:00:15.040> of<00:00:15.190> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
one of the right here is one of the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.970 
one of the right here is one of the
microswitches<00:00:16.450> I've<00:00:16.750> got<00:00:16.990> its<00:00:17.800> got<00:00:17.860> a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
microswitches I've got its got a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.160 
microswitches I've got its got a
wonderful<00:00:18.670> little<00:00:18.820> bent<00:00:19.510> piece<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.990> metal

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
wonderful little bent piece of metal

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.530 
wonderful little bent piece of metal
that<00:00:20.440> runs<00:00:20.710> right<00:00:20.800> up<00:00:21.070> here<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.550> forms

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
that runs right up here and forms

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.350 
that runs right up here and forms
roughly<00:00:23.410> 90<00:00:23.710> degree<00:00:24.010> angle<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.430> fits<00:00:24.700> just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
roughly 90 degree angle that fits just

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.100 
roughly 90 degree angle that fits just
perfectly<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:28.210> studs<00:00:28.570> that<00:00:28.720> I've<00:00:28.900> got

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
perfectly into the studs that I've got

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.660 
perfectly into the studs that I've got
hanging<00:00:29.530> off<00:00:29.680> that<00:00:29.920> gear<00:00:30.160> there<00:00:30.370> and<00:00:30.490> if<00:00:30.550> we

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
hanging off that gear there and if we

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.910 
hanging off that gear there and if we
lift<00:00:30.850> them<00:00:31.030> up<00:00:31.150> you<00:00:31.990> can<00:00:32.020> see<00:00:32.410> them<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:32.739> there

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
lift them up you can see them in there

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040 
lift them up you can see them in there
and<00:00:33.040> if<00:00:33.100> it's<00:00:33.309> right<00:00:33.580> down<00:00:33.820> in<00:00:34.030> there<00:00:34.210> as<00:00:34.449> it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
and if it's right down in there as it

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.189 
and if it's right down in there as it
rotates<00:00:35.260> i<00:00:35.770> get<00:00:36.280> i<00:00:36.730> get<00:00:37.000> one<00:00:37.239> count<00:00:37.540> you'll

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
rotates i get i get one count you'll

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.979 
rotates i get i get one count you'll
hear<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.559> i<00:00:43.589> got<00:00:44.589> one<00:00:44.830> count<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.629> each<00:00:46.659> of<00:00:46.930> the

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
hear it i got one count for each of the

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.110 
hear it i got one count for each of the
quadrants<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.650> of<00:00:48.159> course<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.489> gear<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.879> down

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
quadrants and of course I gear it down

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.380 
quadrants and of course I gear it down
so<00:00:49.900> that<00:00:49.930> I've<00:00:50.140> got<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> lot<00:00:50.559> more<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:52.239> more

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
so that I've got a lot more a lot more

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.860 
so that I've got a lot more a lot more
precision<00:00:52.989> on<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.820> motion<00:00:54.820> for<00:00:55.000> both<00:00:55.659> the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
precision on the motion for both the

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.290 
precision on the motion for both the
equatorial<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:56.860> then<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.519> lateral

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
equatorial and then the the lateral

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.009 
equatorial and then the the lateral
drives<00:00:58.680> both<00:00:59.680> of<00:00:59.949> them<00:01:00.129> use<00:01:00.850> one<00:01:01.120> here<00:01:01.930> I'll

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
drives both of them use one here I'll

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.600 
drives both of them use one here I'll
show<00:01:02.049> it<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.470> in<00:01:02.680> action<00:01:02.830> will<00:01:03.190> run<00:01:03.400> the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
show it to you in action will run the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.410 
show it to you in action will run the
will<00:01:04.150> run<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.420> program<00:01:04.809> dry<00:01:05.080> with<00:01:05.290> no<00:01:05.470> egg<00:01:05.650> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
will run the program dry with no egg and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.550 
will run the program dry with no egg and
first<00:01:07.420> it'll<00:01:07.659> go<00:01:07.840> through<00:01:08.049> a<00:01:08.080> real<00:01:08.320> quick

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
first it'll go through a real quick

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.910 
first it'll go through a real quick
setup<00:01:10.320> initialization<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.560> will<00:01:11.680> start

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
setup initialization and it will start

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
setup initialization and it will start
running<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:13.030> goes<00:01:13.210> pretty<00:01:13.390> quick

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:02:01.370 

and<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.869> course<00:01:46.899> i<00:01:47.200> have<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.380> make<00:01:47.560> my<00:01:47.619> own<00:01:47.799> wire

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090 

okay<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.440> that's<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.190> for<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.970> Lego<00:02:04.840> egba<00:02:05.350> see

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
okay so that's it for the Lego egba see

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.410 
okay so that's it for the Lego egba see
I<00:02:06.130> still<00:02:06.369> got<00:02:06.550> some<00:02:06.700> improvement<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.300> do

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
I still got some improvement to do

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.460 
I still got some improvement to do
mainly<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:09.190> penholder<00:02:09.880> mechanics

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
mainly in the the penholder mechanics

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.530 
mainly in the the penholder mechanics
I'm<00:02:11.470> also<00:02:11.680> thinking<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.370> I'd<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.360> put<00:02:13.480> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I'm also thinking that I'd like to put a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.410 
I'm also thinking that I'd like to put a
limit<00:02:13.750> switch<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.790> on

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
limit switch up in here so on

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.300 
limit switch up in here so on
initialization<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.620> rotate<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.100> all<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
initialization I can rotate it all the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.070 
initialization I can rotate it all the
way<00:02:18.459> over<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.120> tell<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.959> absolute

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
way over and I can tell the absolute

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.870 
way over and I can tell the absolute
position<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.190> doesn't<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.700> much<00:02:21.730> matter

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
position of that doesn't so much matter

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.520 
position of that doesn't so much matter
on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> lateral<00:02:22.720> Drive<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.200> pretty<00:02:23.470> much

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
on the lateral Drive you pretty much

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.059 
on the lateral Drive you pretty much
start<00:02:23.890> anywhere<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.459> want<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.910> blank<00:02:25.209> egg

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
start anywhere you want on a blank egg

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.490 
start anywhere you want on a blank egg
other<00:02:27.069> things<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.450> could<00:02:28.780> consider<00:02:29.230> doing

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
other things that I could consider doing

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.789 
other things that I could consider doing
would<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.760> improve<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.170> egg<00:02:32.320> holders

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
would be to improve the the egg holders

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.880 
would be to improve the the egg holders
but<00:02:33.010> they<00:02:33.220> seem<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.329> too<00:02:34.570> bad<00:02:34.750> i<00:02:35.019> Skyped

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
but they seem to be not too bad i Skyped

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
but they seem to be not too bad i Skyped
a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.250> spring<00:02:36.820> there<00:02:37.030> from<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.390> pen<00:02:37.660> or

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
a little spring there from a pen or

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.690 
a little spring there from a pen or
something<00:02:38.079> like<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.130> there's<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.310> few<00:02:39.340> non

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
something like that so there's a few non

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.180 
something like that so there's a few non
Lego<00:02:40.090> parts<00:02:40.329> but<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> think<00:02:40.959> I'll<00:02:41.109> spare<00:02:41.440> when

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
Lego parts but I think I'll spare when

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.910 
Lego parts but I think I'll spare when
you're<00:02:42.340> doing<00:02:42.670> robotics<00:02:43.350> alright<00:02:44.350> i<00:02:44.530> hope<00:02:44.590> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you're doing robotics alright i hope you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.099 
you're doing robotics alright i hope you
enjoyed<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.570> happy<00:02:46.570> robot<00:02:46.750> making

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
enjoyed it and happy robot making

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.980 
enjoyed it and happy robot making
