00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
quite often the problem they have is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.720 
quite often the problem they have is

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
grip and tight grip on the sticks can

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
grip and tight grip on the sticks can
lead<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:23.060> quite<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.210> few<00:00:24.300> problems<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:26.070> lead

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lead to quite a few problems it can lead

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
lead to quite a few problems it can lead

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
grip guy then then use that although I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400 
grip guy then then use that although I
would<00:02:35.790> recommend<00:02:36.390> practicing<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
would recommend practicing all the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.830 
would recommend practicing all the
techniques<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.040> course<00:02:38.510> another<00:02:39.510> thing<00:02:39.720> in

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
techniques of course another thing in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.030 
techniques of course another thing in
between<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.540> main<00:02:42.540> thing<00:02:42.900> get<00:02:43.140> these<00:02:43.349> three

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
between so main thing get these three

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.360 
between so main thing get these three
fingers<00:02:44.400> out<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.650> what<00:02:47.190> you're

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
fingers out of the way now what you're

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.400 
fingers out of the way now what you're
doing<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:47.970> giving<00:02:48.209> away<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> lot<00:02:49.380> of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
doing is you're giving away a lot of

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.289 
doing is you're giving away a lot of
control<00:02:50.069> right<00:02:50.610> suddenly<00:02:51.599> when<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.900> do<00:02:52.140> this

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
control right suddenly when you do this

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.720 
control right suddenly when you do this
feels<00:02:54.299> really<00:02:54.720> loose<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.290> feels<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:55.950> kind

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
feels really loose it feels really kind

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.710 
feels really loose it feels really kind
of<00:02:56.880> wobbly<00:02:57.540> right<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.610> you're<00:03:00.480> definitely

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
of wobbly right so you're definitely

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.240 
of wobbly right so you're definitely
gonna<00:03:01.079> get<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.440> fear<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.709> you're<00:03:02.040> not

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
gonna get the fear that you're not

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.780 
gonna get the fear that you're not
really<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:03.269> control<00:03:04.069> but<00:03:05.069> that's<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.579> whole

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
really in control but that's the whole

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.720 
really in control but that's the whole
idea<00:03:05.970> behind<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:07.110> right<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.360> when<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.730> start

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
idea behind it right so when you start

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
idea behind it right so when you start
to<00:03:11.970> filling<00:03:12.390> around<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.989> go<00:03:13.349> through

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
to filling around with that go through

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.030 
to filling around with that go through
all<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.849> stuff<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.209> usually<00:03:15.389> do<00:03:15.720> like

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
all the stuff you usually do like

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.289 
all the stuff you usually do like
rudiments<00:03:17.690> single<00:03:18.690> strokes<00:03:19.519> alright<00:03:23.299> when

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
rudiments single strokes alright when

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.000 
rudiments single strokes alright when
you<00:03:24.420> try<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> very<00:03:25.650> first<00:03:25.829> time

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
you try that for the very first time

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.129 
you try that for the very first time
you're<00:03:26.370> good<00:03:26.639> timing<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.510> gonna<00:03:27.660> suffer<00:03:28.109> a

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
you're good timing it's gonna suffer a

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.599 
you're good timing it's gonna suffer a
little<00:03:28.410> bit<00:03:28.560> because<00:03:28.859> like<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> said<00:03:29.340> you're

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
little bit because like I said you're

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.400 
little bit because like I said you're
giving<00:03:29.730> away<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.079> control<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
giving away a bit of control but in the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.229 
giving away a bit of control but in the
long<00:03:34.620> run<00:03:34.829> you're<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.160> gain<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> lot<00:03:36.000> more

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
long run you're gonna gain a lot more

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.220 
long run you're gonna gain a lot more
control<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.230> well<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.269> also<00:03:39.690> teaches<00:03:39.989> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
control as well so it also teaches you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.680 
control as well so it also teaches you
very<00:03:40.739> nicely<00:03:41.040> about<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.030> rebound<00:03:42.389> of<00:03:42.569> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
very nicely about the the rebound of the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.030 
very nicely about the the rebound of the
sticks<00:03:44.660> just<00:03:45.660> feels<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.139> little<00:03:46.170> bit<00:03:46.590> weird

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
sticks just feels a little bit weird

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
sticks just feels a little bit weird
like<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.400> first<00:03:47.609> couple<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.910> times<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.299> try

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
like the first couple of times you try

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.099 
like the first couple of times you try
this

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
this

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.610 
this
okay<00:03:49.950> then<00:03:50.190> try<00:03:50.880> doubles<00:03:51.359> all<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.200> regular

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
okay then try doubles all the regular

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.410 
okay then try doubles all the regular
stuff<00:03:52.859> rudiments<00:03:53.609> right<00:03:55.940> make<00:03:56.940> sure<00:03:57.209> your

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
stuff rudiments right make sure your

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.379 
stuff rudiments right make sure your
fingers<00:03:57.660> are<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:59.370> wrapped<00:03:59.880> around<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
fingers are not wrapped around the

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.230 
fingers are not wrapped around the
drumstick

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.880 

and<00:04:06.050> purpose<00:04:08.170> everything<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.380> can<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:09.740> of

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
and purpose everything you can think of

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.610 
and purpose everything you can think of
paradiddles<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.670> course<00:04:11.500> paradiddles<00:04:12.500> are

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
paradiddles of course paradiddles are

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.070 
paradiddles of course paradiddles are
interesting<00:04:13.160> especially<00:04:13.370> if<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.900> keep<00:04:14.900> on

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
interesting especially if you keep on

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.530 
interesting especially if you keep on
accenting<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:17.350> first<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.530> each<00:04:18.680> group

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
accenting the first of each group

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.930 
accenting the first of each group
because<00:04:20.540> when<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.840> throw<00:04:21.050> down<00:04:21.200> accent

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
because when you throw down accent

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.310 
because when you throw down accent
you're<00:04:22.940> gonna<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.450> deal<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.050> lot<00:04:24.200> of

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
you're gonna have to deal with a lot of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.230 
you're gonna have to deal with a lot of
rebound<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.810> naturally<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:28.640> would<00:04:28.820> want<00:04:29.090> to

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
rebound and naturally you would want to

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.760 
rebound and naturally you would want to
use<00:04:29.480> your<00:04:31.300> three<00:04:32.300> fingers<00:04:32.480> here<00:04:32.690> too<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.560> kind

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
use your three fingers here too to kind

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.820 
use your three fingers here too to kind
of<00:04:33.920> tame<00:04:34.220> your<00:04:34.400> stick<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:35.260> hit<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.410> brakes<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
of tame your stick and hit the brakes a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.030 
of tame your stick and hit the brakes a
little<00:04:36.980> bit<00:04:37.100> right<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.140> not<00:04:39.290> possible<00:04:39.860> if

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
little bit right this is not possible if

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.250 
little bit right this is not possible if
you<00:04:40.510> should<00:04:41.510> try<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:41.780> loose<00:04:42.170> grip<00:04:42.500> approach

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
you should try this loose grip approach

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.720 
you should try this loose grip approach
so<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.320> going<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.650> get<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.830> little<00:04:46.190> bit<00:04:46.370> messy

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
so it's going to get a little bit messy

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.270 
so it's going to get a little bit messy
but<00:04:46.910> like<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.540> said<00:04:47.600> that's<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.800> not<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:49.040> broad

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
but like I said that's it's not a broad

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.940 
but like I said that's it's not a broad
position<00:04:49.670> here<00:04:50.210> it's<00:04:50.390> about<00:04:50.560> learning<00:04:51.560> to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
position here it's about learning to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.300 
position here it's about learning to
trust<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:54.350> stick<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.980> your<00:04:55.310> main<00:04:56.240> form<00:04:56.840> here

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
trust the stick and your main form here

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.550 
trust the stick and your main form here
to<00:04:58.310> be<00:04:58.460> able<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.790> handle<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.480> it's<00:05:00.320> going<00:05:00.500> to

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
to be able to handle this it's going to

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.620 
to be able to handle this it's going to
feel<00:05:00.830> really<00:05:01.400> good<00:05:01.550> after<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.970> while<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.390> bring

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
feel really good after a while to bring

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:12.580 
feel really good after a while to bring
back<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:04.520> remaining<00:05:04.940> three<00:05:05.360> fingers<00:05:11.590> right

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
back the remaining three fingers right

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
straight line so when it

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.860 
straight line so when it
it<00:06:19.350> bounces<00:06:19.740> back<00:06:19.790> this<00:06:20.790> goes<00:06:21.030> up<00:06:21.270> right<00:06:21.510> but

this part of the stick goes down right
if<00:06:25.530> your<00:06:25.800> fingers<00:06:26.730> are<00:06:26.760> in<00:06:27.600> in<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.470> wave<00:06:28.680> the

right<00:06:31.710> away<00:06:33.320> makes<00:06:34.320> sense<00:06:34.590> right<00:06:34.890> so<00:06:35.450> with<00:06:36.450> a

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
right away makes sense right so with a

push pull and even these kind of

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.910 
push pull and even these kind of
techniques<00:06:46.160> you<00:06:47.160> need<00:06:47.370> to<00:06:47.580> learn<00:06:47.760> how<00:06:48.260> to<00:06:49.260> how

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
techniques you need to learn how to how

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.640 
techniques you need to learn how to how
to<00:06:49.980> create<00:06:50.370> space<00:06:51.000> for<00:06:51.330> your<00:06:51.660> drumstick<00:06:52.170> to<00:06:52.530> be

to create space for your drumstick to be

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.570 
to create space for your drumstick to be

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
able to move more freely right all right

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.510 
able to move more freely right all right
anyways<00:06:57.060> I<00:06:57.900> think<00:06:58.380> that<00:06:58.680> should<00:06:58.980> give<00:06:59.190> you<00:06:59.310> the

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.000 
anyways I think that should give you the
basic<00:07:00.000> idea<00:07:00.120> already<00:07:00.540> so<00:07:01.050> it's<00:07:01.200> it's<00:07:01.650> up<00:07:01.860> to

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
basic idea already so it's it's up to

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.620 
basic idea already so it's it's up to
you<00:07:02.160> now<00:07:02.310> to<00:07:02.370> sit<00:07:02.820> down<00:07:02.940> with<00:07:03.120> your<00:07:03.270> practice
