00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.200
 in the next days I will give you 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.630
 details of the trip I made to Switzerland with 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.490
 reason for the cheese awards suites 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.410
 are the prizes that are given every year to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.410
 the best cheeses in the country 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.330
 We left last Wednesday with destination 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.330
 Lugano and Milan 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 and we stayed in this hotel that was the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.820
 chestnut villa which as you see is 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.820
 in front of the lake 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.390
 we have in a restaurant that belongs 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.550
 to the hotel but that is in another building 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 and we went to sleep soon because 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 next day we had an intense day 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.850
 we visited one that would be tiny and is 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.829
 awesome as they have everything that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 is facing the public and I will show you 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 a next video how they make cheese 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.650
 and after that we had a marathon 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.770
 evaluating the cheese we were four 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.509
 hours deliberating we were about 150 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 members of the jury and I do not know how many 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.670
 cheeses had but very many and all 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.670
 excellent 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.600
 That night we had dinner in a cellar and daily 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.150
 next we visited a dairy in the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.520
 they also make fresh cheeses 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.270
 panacotta and other processed products 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
 from milk 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.579
 this is a chocolate factory that 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.579
 being in Switzerland could not miss 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 as we saw in a restaurant in 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.170
 bellinzona you had to climb with a 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.170
 very curious cable car 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.140
 we had the opportunity to pay a visit 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.000
 lightning to the cheese market and then 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.770
 it was already the award ceremony of the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.550
 contest that you can see there 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550
 a lot of importance 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.670
 and the next day after breakfast 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 return to Milan and home 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.110
 Well I hope that you have been from 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 interest until soon
