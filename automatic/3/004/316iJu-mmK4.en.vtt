noise I definitely want to check it on
because<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> nighttime<00:01:30.689> HDR<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.759> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because this was a nighttime HDR and so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
because this was a nighttime HDR and so
it<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.299> pretty<00:01:33.509> dark<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> set<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it was pretty dark and I want to set it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
it was pretty dark and I want to set it
to<00:01:35.430> normal<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.820> under<00:01:36.090> exposed<00:01:36.659> images<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to normal and under exposed images that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.190 
to normal and under exposed images that
way<00:01:38.030> because<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.780> noise

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
way because you really don't need noise

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
way because you really don't need noise
reduction<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.740> overexposed<00:01:41.430> images<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.180> those

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

chromatic<00:01:49.229> aberrations<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.860> definitely<00:01:50.310> want

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
chromatic aberrations I definitely want

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
chromatic aberrations I definitely want
to<00:01:50.759> leave<00:01:51.090> checked<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.350> not

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to leave checked because I really do not

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.090 
to leave checked because I really do not
want<00:01:52.740> any<00:01:52.979> color<00:01:53.310> fringing<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
want any color fringing you get a lot of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.969 
want any color fringing you get a lot of
that<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.490> nighttime<00:01:56.909> HDR<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that a nighttime HDR so I'm going to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
that a nighttime HDR so I'm going to
leave<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.159> checked<00:01:59.520> white<00:02:00.149> balance<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.810> shot

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
leave that checked white balance as shot

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.310 
leave that checked white balance as shot
profoto<00:02:02.369> RGB<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.290> my

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
profoto RGB that is what i use in my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.539 
profoto RGB that is what i use in my
workflow<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.040> i'm<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> leave<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
workflow so i'm just going to leave that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.130 
workflow so i'm just going to leave that
set<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.200> i'm<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> press<00:02:07.560> ok<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
set and i'm going to press ok and as you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.680 
set and i'm going to press ok and as you
can<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.039> convert<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.480> of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
can see it's going to convert all of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.300 
can see it's going to convert all of
or<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.470> going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.770> convert<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.160> raw

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
or not it's going to convert the raw

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.840 
or not it's going to convert the raw
files<00:02:15.610> into<00:02:17.310> HDR<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.400> merge<00:02:18.580> them<00:02:18.610> together

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
files into HDR and merge them together

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.970 
files into HDR and merge them together
so<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:20.020> may<00:02:20.170> take<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.380> while<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.740> I'm<00:02:20.860> just

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
so this may take a while so I'm just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.530 
so this may take a while so I'm just
going<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.160> pause<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.910> screen<00:02:22.000> recording

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
going to pause the screen recording

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.640 
going to pause the screen recording
until<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:23.320> pick<00:02:23.470> up<00:02:23.650> once<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.100> done<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> as

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
until we pick up once it is done so as

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.830 
until we pick up once it is done so as
you<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:26.860> see<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.520> done<00:02:27.820> processing<00:02:28.390> now

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you can see it is done processing now

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.230 
you can see it is done processing now
and<00:02:29.110> don't<00:02:29.890> be<00:02:30.010> alarmed<00:02:30.250> when<00:02:30.580> you're<00:02:30.730> each<00:02:30.880> dr

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
and don't be alarmed when you're each dr

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.260 
and don't be alarmed when you're each dr
pops<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.690> looking<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.820> not<00:02:33.970> do

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
pops up looking like this this is not do

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.300 
pops up looking like this this is not do
your<00:02:34.390> final<00:02:34.630> image<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.590> before<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:36.010> is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
your final image this is before it is

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.640 
your final image this is before it is
what's<00:02:36.550> called<00:02:36.760> tone<00:02:37.240> mapping<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.900> tone

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
what's called tone mapping and tone

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.340 
what's called tone mapping and tone
mapping<00:02:39.120> basically<00:02:40.120> takes<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.630> merge<00:02:40.810> HDR

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
mapping basically takes the merge HDR

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.530 
mapping basically takes the merge HDR
and<00:02:41.650> makes<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.670> look<00:02:42.700> good<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.240> only<00:02:43.360> way<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and makes it look good is the only way I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.570 
and makes it look good is the only way I
can<00:02:43.690> describe<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
can describe it this is just all the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.260 
can describe it this is just all the
exposures<00:02:46.090> combined<00:02:46.570> in<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:48.240> 32-bit<00:02:49.240> to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
exposures combined in a 32-bit to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.070 
exposures combined in a 32-bit to
preview<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:51.360> I'm<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.570> click<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.840> tone

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
preview so I'm going to click on tone

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.480 
preview so I'm going to click on tone
mapping<00:02:53.320> /<00:02:53.620> fusion<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:57.280> away

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
mapping / fusion and as right away

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.820 
mapping / fusion and as right away
you'll<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.850> able<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.090> see<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.600> actually<00:02:59.500> good

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
you'll be able to see and actually good

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.850 
you'll be able to see and actually good
looking<00:03:00.130> preview<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.650> depending<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:02.710> how

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
looking preview so and depending on how

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.800 
looking preview so and depending on how
many<00:03:02.920> shots<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.180> may<00:03:04.270> look<00:03:04.420> take

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
many shots you have it may look take

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.780 
many shots you have it may look take
longer<00:03:05.170> time<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.620> I'm<00:03:06.190> sent<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.430> close<00:03:06.610> these

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
longer time and I'm sent to close these

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.150 
longer time and I'm sent to close these
two<00:03:07.000> windows<00:03:07.330> over<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.050> I'm<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.100> to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
two windows over here and I'm going to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.320 
two windows over here and I'm going to
zoom<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.490> little<00:03:09.550> bit<00:03:09.820> i'm<00:03:10.000> using<00:03:10.240> the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
zoom out a little bit i'm using the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.770 
zoom out a little bit i'm using the
scroll<00:03:10.630> wheel<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:11.020> my<00:03:11.140> mouse<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.710> do<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.070> and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
scroll wheel on my mouse to do that and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.180 
scroll wheel on my mouse to do that and
so<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:13.990> your<00:03:14.020> image<00:03:14.320> open<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.740> the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
so you have your image open and the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.530 
so you have your image open and the
first<00:03:15.400> thing<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.670> always<00:03:15.700> do<00:03:16.240> is<00:03:16.360> come<00:03:16.510> down

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
first thing I always do is come down

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.010 
first thing I always do is come down

reset all the settings to their fault

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.580 
reset all the settings to their fault
because<00:03:27.370> no<00:03:28.060> HDR<00:03:28.510> image<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.110> same<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.500> you

I come straight to is these I always
leave<00:03:39.520> on<00:03:39.700> default<00:03:39.940> tone<00:03:40.450> mapping<00:03:40.690> and

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
leave on default tone mapping and

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.979 
leave on default tone mapping and
details<00:03:41.380> enhancer<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.330> first<00:03:43.570> setting<00:03:43.840> is

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
details enhancer so first setting is

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.650 
details enhancer so first setting is
strength<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:45.640> first<00:03:45.820> thing<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.000> do<00:03:46.060> i<00:03:46.300> drag

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
strength and the first thing I do i drag

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.150 
strength and the first thing I do i drag
it<00:03:46.690> all<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.900> way<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.260> left<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.830> all<00:03:48.070> the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
it all the way to the left so all the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.479 
it all the way to the left so all the
way<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> zero<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:50.530> all<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.890> way<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
way to zero and then all the way to the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.699 
way to zero and then all the way to the
right<00:03:51.610> to<00:03:51.850> 100<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.420> see<00:03:53.350> which<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.620> looks

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
right to 100 and see which one looks

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.699 
right to 100 and see which one looks
better<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:54.519> case<00:03:54.790> 100<00:03:55.510> looks<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.590> little

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
better in this case 100 looks a little

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.610 
better in this case 100 looks a little
overdone<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.370> 0<00:03:58.269> wilkes<00:03:58.540> way<00:03:58.720> under<00:03:59.200> done<00:03:59.350> so

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
overdone and 0 wilkes way under done so

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.800 
overdone and 0 wilkes way under done so
I<00:03:59.890> want<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.250> keep<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.580> somewhere<00:04:01.060> around<00:04:01.180> 80

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.180 

that<00:04:04.810> looks<00:04:05.050> good<00:04:05.230> for<00:04:05.560> me<00:04:05.680> maybe<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:06.010> little

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that looks good for me maybe a little

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.620 
that looks good for me maybe a little
higher<00:04:06.430> maybe<00:04:06.880> something<00:04:07.269> like<00:04:07.390> 90<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.450> that

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
higher maybe something like 90 so that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.630 
higher maybe something like 90 so that
looks<00:04:10.780> good<00:04:10.930> color<00:04:11.709> saturation<00:04:12.160> I<00:04:12.370> leave

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
looks good color saturation I leave

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.300 
looks good color saturation I leave
alone<00:04:12.930> luminosity<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.230> leave<00:04:14.560> alone<00:04:14.830> micro

contrast<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.000> leave<00:04:16.269> alone<00:04:16.540> next<00:04:17.260> thing<00:04:17.440> is

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
contrast I leave alone next thing is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.620 
contrast I leave alone next thing is
moving<00:04:17.890> some<00:04:18.820> people<00:04:19.090> like<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.330> do<00:04:19.419> it<00:04:19.540> in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
moving some people like you do it in

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
light mode I like to leave it just in

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.930 
light mode I like to leave it just in
standard<00:04:22.900> slider<00:04:23.169> form<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.310> once<00:04:24.550> again<00:04:24.669> all

and all the way to the right and this

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.740 
and all the way to the right and this
looks<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.289> little<00:04:34.439> too<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.250> each<00:04:35.879> G<00:04:36.150> hard<00:04:36.360> for<00:04:36.629> my

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
looks a little too on each G hard for my

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.959 
looks a little too on each G hard for my
taste<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.259> I'm<00:04:37.500> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.680> keep<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.039> almost

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
all the way to the left that looks

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.770 
all the way to the left that looks
pretty<00:04:42.810> good<00:04:44.150> maybe<00:04:45.150> I'll<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.569> little<00:04:45.599> more

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780

lunch and as you can see i'm just
playing<00:04:51.389> with<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.539> sliders<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.409> that's<00:04:53.250> all<00:04:53.400> I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
playing with the sliders so that's all I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.610 
playing with the sliders so that's all I
do<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.729> smoothing<00:04:54.000> next<00:04:54.659> white<00:04:55.050> point<00:04:55.319> black

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
do for smoothing next white point black

do for smoothing next white point black
point<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.069> gamma<00:04:56.280> this<00:04:56.639> is<00:04:56.879> where<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.120> first

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
point and gamma this is where I first

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.869 
point and gamma this is where I first
got<00:04:58.080> confused<00:04:58.530> when<00:04:58.650> i<00:04:58.680> first<00:04:58.949> started<00:04:59.340> HD

this<00:05:06.360> as<00:05:06.509> your<00:05:06.780> levels<00:05:07.139> dialog<00:05:07.469> box<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.370> have

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
this as your levels dialog box you have

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.700 
this as your levels dialog box you have
your<00:05:08.610> mid-tone<00:05:09.030> slider<00:05:09.199> your<00:05:10.199> black<00:05:10.440> slider

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
your mid-tone slider your black slider

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.459 
your mid-tone slider your black slider
and<00:05:11.159> your<00:05:11.370> white<00:05:11.550> slider<00:05:12.139> so<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.349> white

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
and your white slider so the white

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.800 
and your white slider so the white
points<00:05:13.800> all<00:05:13.949> of<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.400> highlights<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:15.330> control

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
points all of the highlights is control

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.180 
points all of the highlights is control
the<00:05:16.139> white<00:05:16.289> point<00:05:16.469> controls<00:05:16.919> all<00:05:17.159> the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the white point controls all the

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.969 
the white point controls all the
highlights<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> want<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.529> keep<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.740> dart

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
highlights so I want to keep the dart

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.740 
highlights so I want to keep the dart
relatively<00:05:20.789> dark<00:05:20.969> but<00:05:21.210> as<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.419> can<00:05:21.479> see<00:05:21.629> you

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
relatively dark but as you can see you

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.559 
relatively dark but as you can see you
lose<00:05:21.930> some<00:05:22.139> contrast<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.300> I'm<00:05:24.300> going<00:05:24.539> to

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
lose some contrast and I'm going to

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.570 
lose some contrast and I'm going to
raise<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.990> blacks<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:27.289> then<00:05:28.289> so<00:05:29.069> it<00:05:29.189> looks<00:05:29.219> a

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
raise the blacks and then so it looks a

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.209 
raise the blacks and then so it looks a
little<00:05:30.270> low<00:05:30.599> contrasting<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:31.770> I'm<00:05:32.009> going<00:05:32.129> to

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
little low contrasting so I'm going to

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.519 
little low contrasting so I'm going to
get<00:05:32.310> that<00:05:32.430> back<00:05:32.639> by<00:05:33.029> raising<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.719> gamma<00:05:34.229> the

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
get that back by raising the gamma the

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.379 
get that back by raising the gamma the
gamma<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:34.979> left<00:05:35.279> is<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.699> brighten<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.060> just

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
gamma to the left is to brighten it just

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.659 
gamma to the left is to brighten it just
like<00:05:36.569> photoshop's<00:05:37.050> levels<00:05:37.440> or<00:05:38.219> I'm<00:05:38.370> sorry<00:05:38.580> you

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
like photoshop's levels or I'm sorry you

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.490 
like photoshop's levels or I'm sorry you
darken<00:05:39.029> it<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.889> want<00:05:41.129> to<00:05:41.779> go<00:05:42.779> to<00:05:42.839> the<00:05:43.199> right

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
darken it so I want to go to the right

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.519 
darken it so I want to go to the right
remember<00:05:44.400> this<00:05:44.520> was<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:45.029> nighttime<00:05:45.270> HDR<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.259> I

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
remember this was a nighttime HDR so I

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.189 
remember this was a nighttime HDR so I
want<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:46.979> keep<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.250> more<00:05:47.879> to<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.210> left<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.050> it's

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
want to keep it more to the left so it's

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.990 
want to keep it more to the left so it's
more<00:05:49.319> dark<00:05:50.029> somewhere<00:05:51.029> around<00:05:52.310> one<00:05:53.310> point<00:05:53.550> 13

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
more dark somewhere around one point 13

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.809 
more dark somewhere around one point 13
looks<00:05:54.210> good<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:54.949> again<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.159> won't<00:05:56.400> have<00:05:56.669> to

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
looks good and again you won't have to

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.269 
looks good and again you won't have to
use<00:05:56.849> the<00:05:57.060> same<00:05:57.210> numbers<00:05:57.569> as<00:05:57.690> me<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:58.080> will<00:05:59.069> use

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
use the same numbers as me you will use

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.890 
use the same numbers as me you will use
whatever<00:05:59.520> looks<00:05:59.909> good<00:05:59.969> on<00:06:00.210> your<00:06:00.389> image<00:06:00.539> I

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
whatever looks good on your image I

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.200 
whatever looks good on your image I
leave<00:06:01.589> the<00:06:01.710> color<00:06:01.889> settings<00:06:02.250> alone<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:03.060> we

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
leave the color settings alone so we

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.689 
leave the color settings alone so we
could<00:06:03.360> close<00:06:03.599> those<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.199> then<00:06:04.979> down<00:06:05.250> here<00:06:05.310> I

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
could close those and then down here I

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.100 
could close those and then down here I
might<00:06:05.940> just<00:06:05.969> play<00:06:06.180> with<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.360> micro<00:06:06.690> smoothing

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
might just play with the micro smoothing

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.879 
might just play with the micro smoothing
i<00:06:07.909> will<00:06:08.909> probably<00:06:09.259> most<00:06:10.259> of<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.409> time<00:06:10.589> i<00:06:10.620> leave

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
i will probably most of the time i leave

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.769 
i will probably most of the time i leave
that<00:06:11.129> all<00:06:11.279> the<00:06:11.400> way<00:06:11.460> down<00:06:11.779> highlight

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
that all the way down highlight

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.499 
that all the way down highlight
smoothness<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.680> leaves<00:06:13.919> all<00:06:14.279> the<00:06:14.370> way<00:06:14.430> down<00:06:14.639> so

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
smoothness I leaves all the way down so

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.140 
smoothness I leaves all the way down so
pretty<00:06:15.659> much<00:06:15.779> all<00:06:15.990> these<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.199> leave<00:06:17.089> all<00:06:18.089> of

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
pretty much all these I leave all of

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.339 
pretty much all these I leave all of
them<00:06:18.539> at<00:06:18.629> 0<00:06:19.039> it's<00:06:20.039> like<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.219> collapse<00:06:20.520> those<00:06:20.699> and

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
them at 0 it's like a collapse those and

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.290 
them at 0 it's like a collapse those and
then<00:06:22.349> if<00:06:22.650> I<00:06:22.800> see<00:06:23.250> something<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:24.150> I<00:06:24.240> could

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
then if I see something that I could

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.779 
then if I see something that I could
want<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.289> change<00:06:25.469> a<00:06:25.529> little<00:06:25.620> bit<00:06:25.770> like<00:06:26.310> the

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
want to change a little bit like the

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.119 
want to change a little bit like the
smoothing<00:06:27.659> maybe<00:06:28.139> I<00:06:28.289> want<00:06:28.529> to<00:06:28.620> get<00:06:28.919> a<00:06:28.979> little

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
smoothing maybe I want to get a little

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.059 
smoothing maybe I want to get a little
more<00:06:29.539> less<00:06:30.539> smooth<00:06:30.839> can<00:06:31.289> lower<00:06:31.469> that<00:06:31.589> a<00:06:31.740> little

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
more less smooth can lower that a little

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.389 
more less smooth can lower that a little
bit<00:06:33.110> gamma<00:06:34.110> I<00:06:34.469> probably<00:06:34.889> want<00:06:35.099> a<00:06:35.219> little

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:35.399 
bit gamma I probably want a little

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.800 
bit gamma I probably want a little
brighter<00:06:35.729> so<00:06:36.000> I'm<00:06:36.060> going<00:06:36.209> to<00:06:36.240> drag<00:06:36.479> that<00:06:36.539> back

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
brighter so I'm going to drag that back

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.950 
brighter so I'm going to drag that back
to<00:06:36.959> the<00:06:37.050> right<00:06:37.199> and

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
to the right and

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.320 
to the right and
the<00:06:40.080> white<00:06:40.259> point<00:06:40.520> can<00:06:41.520> drag<00:06:41.789> up<00:06:41.940> a<00:06:42.030> time<00:06:42.389> bit

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
the white point can drag up a time bit

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.170 
the white point can drag up a time bit
Alex<00:06:45.330> good<00:06:45.569> so<00:06:46.259> those<00:06:46.860> are<00:06:47.069> the<00:06:47.310> mostly<00:06:47.789> used

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
Alex good so those are the mostly used

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.420 
Alex good so those are the mostly used
settings<00:06:48.449> that<00:06:48.750> i<00:06:48.780> use<00:06:49.199> in<00:06:49.440> photomatix<00:06:49.800> once

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
settings that i use in photomatix once

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.270 
settings that i use in photomatix once
again<00:06:50.819> go<00:06:51.569> out<00:06:51.599> and<00:06:51.780> experiment<00:06:52.530> that's<00:06:53.069> the

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
again go out and experiment that's the

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.180 
again go out and experiment that's the
best<00:06:53.460> way<00:06:53.610> to<00:06:53.669> learn<00:06:53.849> is<00:06:53.910> to<00:06:54.150> experiment<00:06:54.810> and

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
best way to learn is to experiment and

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.129 
best way to learn is to experiment and
those<00:06:56.190> the<00:06:56.340> process<00:06:56.699> is<00:06:56.940> that<00:06:57.509> i<00:06:57.539> use<00:06:57.900> in

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
those the process is that i use in

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:59.990 
those the process is that i use in
photomatix<00:06:58.410> thanks<00:06:59.310> for<00:06:59.400> watching<00:06:59.729> just

photomatix thanks for watching just
going<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.150> hit<00:07:00.330> process<00:07:00.780> on<00:07:00.960> this<00:07:01.139> image<00:07:01.410> and

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
going to hit process on this image and

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.830 
going to hit process on this image and
it<00:07:02.190> will<00:07:02.340> go<00:07:02.490> through<00:07:02.729> process<00:07:03.449> and<00:07:03.599> you<00:07:03.660> could

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
it will go through process and you could

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.960 
it will go through process and you could
save<00:07:04.110> it<00:07:04.289> and<00:07:04.530> do<00:07:05.220> whatever<00:07:05.460> you<00:07:05.819> would<00:07:05.910> like
