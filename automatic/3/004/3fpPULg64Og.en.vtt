00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hi net gadget man bigger legs here and

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.780 
hi net gadget man bigger legs here and
we<00:00:09.480> proved<00:00:09.750> our<00:00:09.930> boat<00:00:10.340> if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.430> look<00:00:11.580> down<00:00:11.730> here

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
we proved our boat if you look down here

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.900 
we proved our boat if you look down here
you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.299> we<00:00:12.420> got<00:00:12.540> three<00:00:12.900> walbro

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
you can see we got three walbro

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.900 
you can see we got three walbro
carburetors<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.290> on<00:00:16.529> our<00:00:16.910> 85

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
carburetors here and this is on our 85

carburetors here and this is on our 85
force<00:00:18.300> force<00:00:19.050> engine<00:00:20.300> we<00:00:21.300> did<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.770> a

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
force force engine we did had to do a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.769 
force force engine we did had to do a
modification<00:00:23.880> between<00:00:24.510> two<00:00:24.630> these

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
modification between two these

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.120 
modification between two these
carburetors<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.960> we'll<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.050> showing<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
carburetors and we'll be showing you the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.910 
carburetors and we'll be showing you the
result<00:00:29.750> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:31.080> bit<00:00:31.230> once<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.859> in

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
result in a little bit once we get it in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680 
result in a little bit once we get it in
the<00:00:31.980> water<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.879> wanted<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.330> get<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the water but I just wanted to get the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
the water but I just wanted to get the
introduction<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.730> show<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
introduction to this and show you that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.149 
introduction to this and show you that
anything<00:00:36.449> that<00:00:36.600> burns<00:00:36.809> gasoline<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:38.010> be

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:38.159 
anything that burns gasoline can be

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.670 
anything that burns gasoline can be
modified<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.150> gadget<00:00:39.479> man<00:00:39.600> group<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
modified with the gadget man group we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.219 
modified with the gadget man group we
got<00:00:40.830> some<00:00:41.070> exciting<00:00:41.820> results<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.989> we

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
got some exciting results with this we

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.950 
got some exciting results with this we
have<00:00:43.799> tried<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> already<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:44.780> we'll<00:00:45.780> share

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.080 
and as you can see the boat really
smooth<00:01:06.280> since<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.570> modified<00:01:08.570> carburetors<00:01:10.090> we

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
smooth since we modified carburetors we

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.540 
smooth since we modified carburetors we
had<00:01:11.240> 11<00:01:11.540> performance<00:01:13.450> engine<00:01:14.890> locker<00:01:15.890> engine

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
had 11 performance engine locker engine

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.500 
had 11 performance engine locker engine
runs<00:01:17.000> alot<00:01:17.210> smoother<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:19.060> got<00:01:20.060> flora

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
runs alot smoother and got flora

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.150 
runs alot smoother and got flora
throttle<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.200> seems<00:01:21.440> like<00:01:21.650> those<00:01:21.979> little

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
throttle it seems like those little

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.300 
throttle it seems like those little
faster<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:24.410> what<00:01:24.590> we've<00:01:24.710> experienced

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
faster so that's what we've experienced

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.340 
faster so that's what we've experienced
here<00:01:26.170> SIA<00:01:27.850> Debbie's<00:01:28.850> st<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.450> behind<00:01:29.780> here<00:01:30.080> dude

just wanted to mention that sweet
grooved<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:07.130> engine<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:10.569> acceleration<00:02:11.569> has

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
grooved this engine the acceleration has

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.440 
grooved this engine the acceleration has
been<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> little<00:02:12.709> better<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.269> also

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
been a little better and you can also

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.800 
been a little better and you can also
notice<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.989> your<00:02:15.230> throttle<00:02:15.620> 50th<00:02:16.040> rato<00:02:16.280> here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
notice that your throttle 50th rato here

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.000 
notice that your throttle 50th rato here
before

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
before

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.429 
before
you<00:02:19.280> probably<00:02:19.549> going<00:02:19.879> like<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.439> throttle

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
you probably going like this throttle

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.390 
you probably going like this throttle
and<00:02:22.250> now

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
and now

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.140 
and now
get<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:24.879> extra<00:02:25.120> bit

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

before<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:30.930> about

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
before I think what do you think about

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.040 
before I think what do you think about
there<00:02:31.830> was<00:02:32.100> stopped<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.810> seems

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
there was stopped in and it just seems

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.410 
there was stopped in and it just seems
like<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:36.180> extra

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
like now you just have that little extra

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.960 
like now you just have that little extra
home

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.270 

that's<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> best<00:02:39.900> way<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> explain<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.710> we

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that's the best way to explain it we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.980 
that's the best way to explain it we
haven't<00:02:41.580> figured<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.060> how<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
haven't figured out how to really get a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.930 
haven't figured out how to really get a
good<00:02:43.200> measurement<00:02:43.440> yet<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.460> don't<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.790> an

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
good measurement yet we don't have an

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.220 
good measurement yet we don't have an
engine<00:02:45.090> idle<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.780> boat<00:02:46.620> motor<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.960> we<00:02:48.960> have

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
engine idle for a boat motor and we have

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.050 
engine idle for a boat motor and we have
to<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.620> more<00:02:49.860> work<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.490> get<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
to do a little more work and get a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.850 
to do a little more work and get a
little<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.360> time<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.690> be<00:02:52.020> able<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.410> measure

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
little more time to be able to measure

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.580 
little more time to be able to measure
the<00:02:53.100> fuel<00:02:53.340> efficiency<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:54.990> anyway

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the fuel efficiency on this but anyway

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
the fuel efficiency on this but anyway
