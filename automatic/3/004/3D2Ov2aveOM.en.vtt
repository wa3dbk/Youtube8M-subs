00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
deficit that's left behind in the timing

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.510 
deficit that's left behind in the timing
cover<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.789> he's<00:00:18.539> using<00:00:18.779> sandpaper<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

we just got to clean it out really well

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.689 
we just got to clean it out really well
and<00:00:24.350> once<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.220> need<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> remove

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and once we do that we need to remove

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
and once we do that we need to remove

any debris that's left behind any grit

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.450 
any debris that's left behind any grit
from<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> sandpaper<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.060> anything<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.450 

this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> new<00:00:39.000> front<00:00:39.629> main<00:00:39.809> seal<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:41.340> need

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this is the new front main seal you need

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
this is the new front main seal you need
to<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> grease<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to put a little bit of grease on it so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
to put a little bit of grease on it so
that<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.800> front<00:00:44.640> pulley<00:00:44.879> gets<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that when the front pulley gets put in

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
that when the front pulley gets put in
it<00:00:46.250> doesn't<00:00:47.250> tear<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> rubber<00:00:48.059> seal<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it doesn't tear up the rubber seal it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
it doesn't tear up the rubber seal it
just<00:00:49.289> helps<00:00:49.530> things<00:00:49.770> move<00:00:50.010> together<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.399> little

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
just helps things move together a little

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.770 
just helps things move together a little
bit<00:00:51.079> then<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> Permatex<00:00:53.660> sealant<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bit then this is a Permatex sealant that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.000 
bit then this is a Permatex sealant that
you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.170> buy<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.410> scout<00:00:55.649> parts<00:00:55.949> comm<00:00:56.600> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
you can buy on scout parts comm and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.080 
you can buy on scout parts comm and
you're<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> way

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you're going to put that all the way

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.560 
you're going to put that all the way
around<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:01.559> outer<00:01:01.859> diameter<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.329> front

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
around the outer diameter of the front

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
around the outer diameter of the front
main<00:01:03.780> seal<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
main seal and then you're going to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
main seal and then you're going to
smooth<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.869> fingers<00:01:07.260> or

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
smooth it out with your fingers or

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
smooth it out with your fingers or
whatever<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.460> make<00:01:08.640> sure<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.150> evenly

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
whatever to make sure that it's evenly

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
whatever to make sure that it's evenly
distributed<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.560> around<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
distributed all the way around the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
distributed all the way around the
perimeter<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.600> front<00:01:13.110> main<00:01:13.260> seal<00:01:15.020> then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
perimeter of the front main seal then

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679 
perimeter of the front main seal then
you're<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.430> put<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.520> into<00:01:17.729> place<00:01:17.970> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you're going to put it into place don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.100 
you're going to put it into place don't
drop<00:01:18.930> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
drop it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
drop it
oh<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:20.780> just<00:01:21.780> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> snug<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> then

will<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> help<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> lock<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.409> into

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
will also kind of help to lock it into

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
will also kind of help to lock it into
place<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> future<00:01:36.829> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.450> front

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
place in the future this is the front

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.069 
place in the future this is the front
pulley<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.770> harmonic<00:01:41.460> balancer<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.119> the

thing is putting on there is an easy
sleeve<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> speed<00:01:46.049> sleeve<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
sleeve or a speed sleeve and this

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.350 
sleeve or a speed sleeve and this
prevents<00:01:49.860> any<00:01:50.600> old<00:01:52.729> ridge<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.030> might<00:01:54.240> have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
prevents any old ridge that might have

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.870 
prevents any old ridge that might have
built<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> old<00:01:55.380> seal<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
built up from the old seal on this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.530 
built up from the old seal on this
pulley<00:01:57.469> from<00:01:58.469> being<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.829> leak<00:01:59.040> hazard<00:01:59.540> so

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
pulley from being a leak hazard so

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.359 
pulley from being a leak hazard so
you've<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> new<00:02:00.960> surface<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.950> push<00:02:02.189> up

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you've got a new surface to push up

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.230 
you've got a new surface to push up
against<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> new<00:02:03.659> front<00:02:03.930> main<00:02:04.110> seal<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
