00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.380 
all that stuff but I'm still learning so
anyway<00:00:37.100> let's<00:00:37.550> just<00:00:37.699> go<00:00:37.820> ahead<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.239> go<00:00:38.359> over

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
anyway let's just go ahead and go over

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.540 
anyway let's just go ahead and go over
the<00:00:38.690> physical<00:00:38.899> aspects<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.739> these<00:00:40.309> headphones

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
the physical aspects of these headphones

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.660 
the physical aspects of these headphones
first<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:41.989> down<00:00:42.500> at<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.710> bottom<00:00:42.949> you've<00:00:43.250> got<00:00:43.309> a

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
first so down at the bottom you've got a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.360 
first so down at the bottom you've got a
I<00:00:43.969> believe<00:00:44.539> a<00:00:44.750> gold-plated<00:00:45.620> headphone<00:00:46.129> jack

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
I believe a gold-plated headphone jack

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.910 
I believe a gold-plated headphone jack
it's<00:00:47.149> a<00:00:47.269> little<00:00:47.539> wide<00:00:47.809> however<00:00:48.379> I<00:00:48.469> did<00:00:48.769> not

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
it's a little wide however I did not

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.979 
it's a little wide however I did not
have<00:00:49.129> any<00:00:49.339> problems<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:49.820> any<00:00:50.089> of<00:00:50.269> my<00:00:50.390> cases

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
have any problems with any of my cases

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.110 
have any problems with any of my cases
even<00:00:51.230> one<00:00:51.499> of<00:00:51.530> them<00:00:51.679> that<00:00:52.640> was<00:00:52.760> really

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
even one of them that was really

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.459 
even one of them that was really
recessed<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:53.929> that's<00:00:54.199> good<00:00:55.690> yeah<00:00:56.719> no<00:00:57.050> problems

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
recessed so that's good yeah no problems

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.220 
recessed so that's good yeah no problems
there<00:00:57.679> it's<00:00:58.300> if<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.449> go<00:00:59.570> up<00:00:59.749> a<00:00:59.870> little<00:01:00.079> bit

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
there it's if you go up a little bit

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.259 
there it's if you go up a little bit
you'll<00:01:00.409> see<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.829> cord<00:01:01.129> now<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.760> cord<00:01:02.120> I

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
you'll see the cord now the cord I

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.570 
you'll see the cord now the cord I
believe<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.140> one<00:01:03.499> of<00:01:03.530> those<00:01:03.710> flat<00:01:04.010> tangle<00:01:04.550> free

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
believe is one of those flat tangle free

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.000 
believe is one of those flat tangle free
ones<00:01:05.060> meaning<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.440> know<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:06.860> not

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
ones meaning that you know it's not

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.560 
ones meaning that you know it's not
really<00:01:07.220> going<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.370> tangle<00:01:07.730> easily<00:01:07.940> unless<00:01:08.360> you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
really going to tangle easily unless you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.690 
really going to tangle easily unless you
really<00:01:08.750> want<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.620> that's<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
really want it to and that's the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.370 
really want it to and that's the
experience<00:01:10.910> I've<00:01:11.330> gotten<00:01:11.660> as<00:01:11.810> well<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.140> I

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
experience I've gotten as well it I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.860 
experience I've gotten as well it I
couldn't<00:01:12.980> really<00:01:13.130> get<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.610> tangle<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:14.030> well

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
couldn't really get it to tangle on well

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.040 
couldn't really get it to tangle on well
an<00:01:15.050> accident<00:01:15.560> at<00:01:15.650> least<00:01:16.030> it's<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.180> little<00:01:17.210> kind

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
an accident at least it's a little kind

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.720 
an accident at least it's a little kind
of<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.230> little<00:01:18.440> bouncy<00:01:19.040> which<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.490> kind

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
of like a little bouncy which the kind

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.100 
of like a little bouncy which the kind
gets<00:01:19.970> annoying<00:01:20.180> doesn't<00:01:20.510> really<00:01:20.660> just<00:01:20.900> hang

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
gets annoying doesn't really just hang

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.340 
gets annoying doesn't really just hang
down<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.940> store<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.330> in<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.930> a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
down like if you store it in a in a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
down like if you store it in a in a
circle<00:01:24.920> position<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.520> kind<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.790> stays<00:01:26.060> like

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
circle position it kind of stays like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.380 
circle position it kind of stays like
that<00:01:26.300> which<00:01:27.200> sometimes<00:01:27.770> got<00:01:28.010> annoying<00:01:28.360> but<00:01:29.360> I

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
that which sometimes got annoying but I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.120 
that which sometimes got annoying but I
still<00:01:29.750> really<00:01:30.050> like<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.440> cord<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:30.830> really

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
still really like the cord it's really

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.130 
still really like the cord it's really
nice<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:32.090> kind<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.300> like<00:01:32.390> bounces<00:01:32.900> back

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
nice and you kind of like bounces back

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.370 
nice and you kind of like bounces back
after<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.710> squish<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:35.020> right<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.200> going

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
after you squish it all right so going

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.570 
after you squish it all right so going
up<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.650> little<00:01:36.800> bit<00:01:36.920> you'll<00:01:37.040> see<00:01:37.070> like<00:01:37.370> the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
up a little bit you'll see like the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.330 
up a little bit you'll see like the
little<00:01:37.880> separator<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.410> kind<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.740> big<00:01:39.980> I<00:01:40.160> wish

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
little separator it's kind of big I wish

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.920 
little separator it's kind of big I wish
they<00:01:40.490> would<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.790> made<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.510> little<00:01:41.660> smaller

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
they would have made it a little smaller

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.800 
they would have made it a little smaller
just<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.620> also<00:01:42.950> make<00:01:43.190> these<00:01:43.820> headphones<00:01:44.240> away

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
just to also make these headphones away

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.200 
just to also make these headphones away
a<00:01:44.840> little<00:01:45.110> bit<00:01:45.200> less<00:01:45.470> however<00:01:45.910> not<00:01:46.910> really<00:01:47.180> a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
a little bit less however not really a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.000 
a little bit less however not really a
big<00:01:47.420> deal<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.870> didn't<00:01:48.200> notice<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.560> whole<00:01:48.710> lot<00:01:48.890> of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
big deal I didn't notice a whole lot of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.740 
big deal I didn't notice a whole lot of
noise<00:01:49.190> if<00:01:49.430> you're<00:01:49.520> walking<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.540> kind<00:01:50.720> of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
noise if you're walking and it kind of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.030 
noise if you're walking and it kind of
starts<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.140> hit<00:01:51.290> your<00:01:51.440> chest<00:01:51.740> or<00:01:51.860> anything

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
starts to hit your chest or anything

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.180 
starts to hit your chest or anything
which<00:01:52.460> which<00:01:52.910> is<00:01:53.060> fine<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.230> also<00:01:54.470> does<00:01:54.890> come

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
which which is fine this also does come

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.790 
which which is fine this also does come
with<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.640> clip<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.270> can<00:01:56.840> use<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.470> attach

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
with a clip you can use this to attach

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.320 
with a clip you can use this to attach
it<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.160> your<00:01:58.190> shirt<00:01:58.550> which<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.000> found<00:01:59.240> very

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
it to your shirt which I found very

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.270 
it to your shirt which I found very
useful<00:01:59.690> especially<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.860> car

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
useful especially in the car

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.310 
useful especially in the car
I<00:02:01.310> brought<00:02:02.060> these<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> long<00:02:02.600> road<00:02:02.810> trip<00:02:02.870> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
I brought these on a long road trip and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.070 
I brought these on a long road trip and
it<00:02:03.950> really<00:02:04.220> helped<00:02:04.550> for<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.270> headphones<00:02:05.690> to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
it really helped for the headphones to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.160 
it really helped for the headphones to
stay<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.560> my<00:02:06.710> ear<00:02:06.920> by<00:02:07.190> using<00:02:07.430> these<00:02:08.170> alright

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
stay in my ear by using these alright

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.719 
stay in my ear by using these alright
and<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:09.440> if<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.649> go<00:02:09.770> up<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.220> are<00:02:10.550> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
and then if you go up there are the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.120 
and then if you go up there are the
headphones<00:02:11.270> themselves<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:12.170> really<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
headphones themselves I really like the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.600 
headphones themselves I really like the
design

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
design

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.540 
design
looks<00:02:13.730> really<00:02:14.060> nice<00:02:15.160> whether<00:02:16.160> they're<00:02:16.400> in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
looks really nice whether they're in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.850 
looks really nice whether they're in
your<00:02:16.700> ear<00:02:16.880> or<00:02:17.120> I'll<00:02:17.330> show<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.570> what<00:02:18.530> they<00:02:18.650> look

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
your ear or I'll show you what they look

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.770 
your ear or I'll show you what they look
like<00:02:18.890> whenever<00:02:19.280> they're<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.600> your

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
like whenever they're actually in your

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.200 
like whenever they're actually in your
ear<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.100> see<00:02:22.310> they<00:02:22.490> kind<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.790> do<00:02:22.940> stick

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
ear as you can see they kind of do stick

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.730 
ear as you can see they kind of do stick
out<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> little<00:02:23.540> bit<00:02:23.930> depending<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
out a little bit depending on the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250 
out a little bit depending on the
flanges<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.550> using<00:02:25.820> however<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.750> really

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
flanges you're using however I really

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.800 
flanges you're using however I really
like<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> look<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.920> them<00:02:28.450> there<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.600> some

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
like the look of them there is some

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
like the look of them there is some
branding<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.440> side<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.160> just

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
branding on the side and this is just

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
branding on the side and this is just
jail<00:02:31.820> abs<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.270> then<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:33.260> one<00:02:33.560> end<00:02:33.770> you've<00:02:33.920> got

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
jail abs and then on one end you've got

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.370 
jail abs and then on one end you've got
like<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> little<00:02:34.610> Adam<00:02:35.210> logo<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.840> guess<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
like a little Adam logo I guess it's the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.620 
like a little Adam logo I guess it's the
jlabbe<00:02:36.710> logo<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> other<00:02:38.060> end<00:02:38.300> you've

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
jlabbe logo then on the other end you've

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.290 
jlabbe logo then on the other end you've
got<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:39.110> work<00:02:39.260> flanges<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.490> comes<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:40.940> a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
got your work flanges this comes with a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.500 
got your work flanges this comes with a
few<00:02:41.750> pair<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.080> flanges<00:02:42.530> including<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:44.300> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
few pair of flanges including just a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.199 
few pair of flanges including just a
single<00:02:45.140> or<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.770> double<00:02:46.400> flanges<00:02:46.850> which<00:02:46.910> are

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
single or in double flanges which are

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.300 
single or in double flanges which are
really<00:02:47.330> nice<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.110> doubles<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.980> most

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
really nice I like the doubles the most

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.580 
really nice I like the doubles the most
and<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.600> try<00:02:50.780> all<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.110> them<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.350> really

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and you can try all of them it's really

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
and you can try all of them it's really
nice<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.520> many<00:02:52.700> different<00:02:53.660> pairs<00:02:54.080> and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
nice to have so many different pairs and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.360 
nice to have so many different pairs and
you<00:02:54.380> can<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.709> find<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> one<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.280> works

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you can just find the one that works

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.540 
you can just find the one that works
best<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:57.080> me<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.800> medium<00:02:58.310> size

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
best for you for me it's the medium size

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.080 
best for you for me it's the medium size
two<00:02:58.760> double<00:02:59.120> flange<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.890> what<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.760> good

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
two double flange and it's what the good

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.640 
two double flange and it's what the good
thing<00:03:02.270> about<00:03:02.300> these<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:03.500> really

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
thing about these is that they really

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.040 
thing about these is that they really
stain<00:03:04.010> your<00:03:04.190> hair<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:04.910> also<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:05.570> block<00:03:05.870> out

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
stain your hair but also they block out

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.720 
stain your hair but also they block out
noise<00:03:06.290> better<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.190> second

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
noise better because of that second

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.430 
noise better because of that second
flange<00:03:08.000> which<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:08.989> alright

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
flange which I really like alright

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.590 
flange which I really like alright
moving<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.040> sound<00:03:10.370> quality<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.820> really<00:03:11.420> like

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
moving on to sound quality I really like

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.020 
moving on to sound quality I really like
the<00:03:11.750> sound<00:03:11.930> quality<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.470> base<00:03:12.890> isn't<00:03:13.250> exactly

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
the sound quality the base isn't exactly

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.570 
the sound quality the base isn't exactly
the<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:15.260> not<00:03:15.380> really<00:03:15.590> overblown<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.430> you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
the it's not really overblown like you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.750 
the it's not really overblown like you
might<00:03:16.730> hear<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.090> beats<00:03:17.530> by<00:03:18.530> dr.<00:03:18.590> dre<00:03:19.010> however<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
might hear on beats by dr. dre however I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.370 
might hear on beats by dr. dre however I
think<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.209> actually<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.230> nice

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
think it's actually at a really nice

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.170 
think it's actually at a really nice
level<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.950> would<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.580> been<00:03:22.700> fine<00:03:22.970> with<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
level I would have been fine with a

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.690 
level I would have been fine with a
little<00:03:23.510> bit<00:03:23.600> more<00:03:23.810> bass<00:03:24.170> however<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:25.100> think

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
little bit more bass however I think

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.060 
little bit more bass however I think
that<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.269> point<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:26.930> at<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.709> really

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
that the the point it is at is really

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.670 
that the the point it is at is really
nice<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:28.970> far<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.480> mids<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> highs

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
nice as far as the mids and the highs

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.890 
nice as far as the mids and the highs
