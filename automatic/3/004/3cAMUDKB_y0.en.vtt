what made last winter so historic was
the<00:00:06.810> fact<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.259> have<00:00:07.470> three<00:00:07.710> major<00:00:08.309> winter

classic<00:00:38.219> El<00:00:38.430> Nino<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> strong<00:00:39.600> Pacific

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
classic El Nino we had a strong Pacific

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
classic El Nino we had a strong Pacific
jet<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> south<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.120> did

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
jet well down to the south well this did

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
jet well down to the south well this did
it<00:00:42.629> took<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> low<00:00:43.260> pressures<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> Gulf

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it took the low pressures into the Gulf

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
it took the low pressures into the Gulf
of<00:00:44.520> Mexico<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.140> gain

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
of Mexico this is where they would gain

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
of Mexico this is where they would gain
all<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.340> moisture<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.539> those<00:00:48.750> low

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
all this moisture then those low

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.389 
all this moisture then those low
pressures<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.559> ride<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> eastern

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
pressures we would ride up the eastern

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.100 
pressures we would ride up the eastern
seaboard<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:51.270> would<00:00:51.449> encounter<00:00:51.809> these

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
seaboard they would encounter these

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
seaboard they would encounter these
shots<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.620> cold<00:00:52.920> air

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
shots of cold air

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
shots of cold air
this<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:53.969> allow<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> storm<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
this would allow that storm system to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
this would allow that storm system to
really<00:00:55.230> bomb<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.579> would<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.910> those

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
really bomb out and we would get those

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
really bomb out and we would get those
intense<00:00:57.840> snowfalls<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> season<00:00:59.309> however

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
intense snowfalls this season however

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
intense snowfalls this season however
the<00:01:00.180> pattern<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> completely<00:01:01.199> different

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the pattern is completely different

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
the pattern is completely different
we're<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> La<00:01:02.550> Nina<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> means<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we're in a La Nina what this means is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
we're in a La Nina what this means is
the<00:01:03.840> jet<00:01:04.049> stream<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> north<00:01:05.549> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the jet stream is up to the north so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
the jet stream is up to the north so
those<00:01:05.820> low<00:01:06.030> pressure<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> track<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
those low pressure is the track of the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
those low pressure is the track of the
storms<00:01:07.560> bring<00:01:08.130> them<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.460> from<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> Midwest<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
storms bring them in from the Midwest so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.789 
storms bring them in from the Midwest so
they<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.080> opportunity<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> get

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
they don't have an opportunity to get

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
they don't have an opportunity to get
any<00:01:11.100> moisture<00:01:11.400> from<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> Gulf<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.659> Mexico<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
any moisture from the Gulf of Mexico the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
any moisture from the Gulf of Mexico the
Gulf<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.680> closed<00:01:14.250> down<00:01:14.549> essentially<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
Gulf is closed down essentially this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
Gulf is closed down essentially this
storm<00:01:16.200> track<00:01:16.439> though<00:01:16.619> will<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.340> pulling<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
storm track though will be pulling in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
storm track though will be pulling in
some<00:01:17.909> warmer<00:01:18.630> air<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.080> instead<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> storms

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
some warmer air so instead of storms

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
some warmer air so instead of storms
where<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.939> snow<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.600> expecting

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
where we have all snow we are expecting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
where we have all snow we are expecting
a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> storms<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.490> mixed<00:01:24.000> precipitation

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a lot of storms with mixed precipitation

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
a lot of storms with mixed precipitation
and<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:26.100> limit<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and we think that really limit the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
and we think that really limit the
snowfall<00:01:27.240> amounts<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:28.020> much<00:01:28.200> snow<00:01:28.350> are

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
snowfall amounts so how much snow are

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.100 
snowfall amounts so how much snow are
expecting<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> entire<00:01:30.390> season<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
expecting for the entire season for

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.800 
expecting for the entire season for
Philadelphia<00:01:31.909> fourteen<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> half<00:01:33.150> inches

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Philadelphia fourteen and a half inches

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.280 
Philadelphia fourteen and a half inches
of<00:01:33.990> snow<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.920> 25%<00:01:35.549> below<00:01:36.390> average<00:01:36.810> if

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
of snow that's 25% below average if

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
of snow that's 25% below average if
you're<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> Allentown<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.220> expecting<00:01:38.640> two

you're in Allentown we're expecting two

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.719 
you're in Allentown we're expecting two

feet of snow Atlantic City not much at

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.850 
feet of snow Atlantic City not much at
all<00:01:41.820> only<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.360> eight<00:01:42.630> inches<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.350> snow<00:01:43.619> and

all only about eight inches of snow and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.850 
all only about eight inches of snow and

in the Poconos 53 inches that's 15
percent<00:01:47.280> below<00:01:47.610> normal<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.119> before<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
percent below normal but before you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
percent below normal but before you
