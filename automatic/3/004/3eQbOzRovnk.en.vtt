00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.350
 good morning with you i'm olga platonov and 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.740
 today's good mood is ours 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.290
 the story will be 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.039
 about the gold garden so I call 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.470
 I chose this compost for myself 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.310
 instead of just making a pile 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.099
 I bought such a small composter in 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.680
 it compost prepares very quickly but 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.739
 remember that you can harvest compost 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.949
 and in the winter , look, I have this 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.830
 such a little basket I wrapped her with a cloth 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.400
 and here all dry home are collected 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.339
 waste generally compost should consist of 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.159
 the two components I conditionally call them 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.110
 green and brown green is all 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.559
 plant materials that contain 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.739
 nitrogen 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:00.530
 this leaves any food waste 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.839
 mowed grass and any weeds but 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.269
 only there is no blooming and no fruits 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.070
 second group of brown materials 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.380
 which contain hydrocarbons this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.360
 twigs this land sawdust old leaves and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.290
 of course they should all be placed 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.020
 in layers 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.380
 if you had a bunch then this bunch 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.840
 would need to shovel and chores 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.759
 air is very important for proper 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.579
 education campus besides enrollment 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 compost air is very important moistening 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.780
 therefore, periodically once a week 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.289
 compost needs to be watered and so 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 he will mature in a year or two 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.329
 but now there are such wonderful boosters 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.609
 processing of country waste which 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.700
 help you get ready good 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:52.030
 compost in just 25 days and do it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 very easy to take 10 liters of water 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 and spread a small bag in them 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.300
 This bag contains microbes and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.920
 enzymes water must be rain either 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.750
 by no means sucks it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.759
 Chlorinated because there are living 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.759
 organisms from chlorine they just die 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.610
 if you did everything right then through 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.220
 25 days you will be so good 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 compost and this land will become real 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.450
 a treat for your fruit and vegetable 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.820
 cultures 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.100
 but if you are confused by the type of container 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.830
 compost then I suggest to throw on 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.920
 him mesh and top on top layer 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.140
 You can plant a pumpkin and you, along with 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.330
 compost will grow good turns 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.330
 have a good mood
