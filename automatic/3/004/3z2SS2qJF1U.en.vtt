00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:01.759
 Hello everybody 

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.560
 Today video and video which explains the structure of the computer 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.930
 maybe it would be or one or the other of you percent was just one 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.500
 Problem to solve this yourself as for example when replacing a new one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.519
 graphic card 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.999
 since I do not associate you with too much jigsaw 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.999
 Just look at the individual components explanation for this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.009
 the municipality of Roeser where all the components of the computer are built in 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.070
 become 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 this slightly smaller case 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.560
 Cards for people who do not do too much with the calculator 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.380
 Today one of them is currently sitting at the computer currently counting four to five 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.890
 a larger housing suffice 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.230
 such as the Greens 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.320
 there there is air circulation in temperature administration 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 easier to accomplish than for the small PC 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 to make the majority 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.840
 here we see the motherboard 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 Motherboard or been 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.380
 Here all possible components will come together now 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 Formations from Gettorf between individual functions 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.620
 take the extra seat 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.060
 from the man with the heart Gallen 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.520
 the one under this minster is a victor 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.590
 you could almost compare with the heart of man you now the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 first components would compare with the physiology of humans 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.080
 this is a very small step 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.710
 something like 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.910
 Yes 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.560
 in appearance 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 no major damage 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.770
 to mention next maybe the short-term memory of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.270
 Computers 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 in technical language called memory 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.320
 as I said 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.350
 these 3 are estimated 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.409
 and 7 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.700
 In some places there are up to four slots but now why can talk 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.470
 I have to make a pleasure 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.320
 she has the dimensions and weights make that legally even one 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 Euro rise 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.279
 Marco Melandri Powering a computer 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.209
 I've built this up now what is it all about here 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.270
 as with this device 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.149
 continue who is connected 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.369
 the topmost computer is powered 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.489
 because whole cable salad here 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.679
 then leads the stream to the individual small advantage 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.029
 such as St on the drive 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.609
 Scapa drive 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.849
 or if he was already installed there 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.849
 to consume video cards and so far 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.229
 in the finished state that does not look personal 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.369
 you can see a lot of cable clutter 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.370
 is the Islamists from Borken components over the wrong 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.769
 maybe a beginner or something with a new overview 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.589
 then I'll show you a graphics card first 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.370
 yes the good piece 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.969
 now also finish eleventh 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.579
 he reckons to be as old as twelve years old when I'm still alive 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.259
 older 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.909
 and 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.650
 meanwhile, there are many features right in the main gate location for that 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.930
 Motherboard integrates so that you still have such creative 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.039
 can safely do Mannesmann pipe work done 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.299
 if you do it like revisions or playing games or something 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.210
 ever 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.649
 own graphics card or from the cadastral office 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.119
 we see here 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.009
 two different connections 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.329
 the belief is for the older generation monitors 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.389
 I want these thick tube monitors 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.979
 by means of certain adapters one can 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.219
 This connection type also convert this connection type 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.299
 so far it is possible to 10 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.509
 This video card is for information processed by your computer 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.049
 will comment on pictures 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.039
 to transmit a monitor 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.039
 like Peter Neher 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.050
 the auction on is also one of the card 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.379
 necessary 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.379
 yes, even one 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.840
 not much difference to the RAF's map 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.090
 however, one of Katie is not quite as elaborate as a graphics card 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.969
 so that you do not need too much cooling 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.969
 Today's graphics cards typed more correctly again 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 the fakes of card for something more sophisticated 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.830
 pc-user 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.719
 Unfortunately, this is Catholic 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.319
 but as an object of intuition quite useful 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.909
 in this computer I have the 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.219
 she was aboard the quartet 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.339
 Unfortunately, I can not show which area is enough for Kaka 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.659
 responsible is 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.169
 but you can all recognize these three connections usually one that Ron 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.419
 Carter has percent off here 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.419
 to see the output from the motherboard 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.040
 I had to increase it a little more percent 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.009
 Short-term memory said 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.539
 one wonders, of course, the whole would be happy 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.389
 Data saved around 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.059
 when the computer is off 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.409
 For that, there's long-term memory, so to speak, of the brain of the computer 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.949
 I'll show you this now 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.110
 where does she look like 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.240
 a hard disk 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 this one is only for 80 gigabytes in size 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.770
 it was even older than that 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.710
 one if smaller variants 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.710
 where they get 2 points 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.849
 so 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.279
 Next up is the question of how the computer works with the Internet 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.319
 to be able to communicate 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.319
 There is either a board for that 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.229
 like these here and then, these were not standard on the 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:31.849
 Airbus is lost 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.849
 that you even had to buy Radsplit board 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.710
 since they have no connection for the network cable 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.590
 Today's computers can also be found here 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.199
 a connection 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.199
 at the motherboard 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.919
 and since these computers are older, they are a museum piece at the bureaucratic level 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.380
 So-called chain drive something like that is almost nothing these days 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.180
 more if you interpret everything differently nowadays 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.889
 downloads and installs or 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.330
 Already from CD or DVD percent can book both studies of operating systems 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.990
 yes not that that is even more that is a smaller one 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.639
 it can be even greater praise received the greater joy even earlier 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.379
 successful work both the 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.439
 Capacity of this chain is limited to only a small amount 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
 and that's how it looks from the front 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.539
 good that for the first time we go it main component of a computer 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.090
 In the next video I will go on the whole components in detail 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.779
 Built-in computer 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:54.499
 one or the other of you then maybe more percent new 

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:57.499
 Graphics card can install new hard drive 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.059
 I hope you enjoyed it and would be happy 

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.499
 and one or the other comment area 

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:05.440
 in the video 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.270
 would refrain 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.949
 sweet
