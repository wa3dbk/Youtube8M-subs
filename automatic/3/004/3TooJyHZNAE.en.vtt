twist
so<00:03:23.150> hopefully<00:03:23.359> that<00:03:23.750> doesn't<00:03:24.079> affect<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so hopefully that doesn't affect the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.080 
so hopefully that doesn't affect the
foundation<00:03:25.670> because<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:25.880> know<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
foundation because you know the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.610 
foundation because you know the
foundation<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> most<00:03:27.019> important<00:03:27.440> thing

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
foundation is the most important thing

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.289 
foundation is the most important thing

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
you really want that to be flat as

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.569 
you really want that to be flat as
possible<00:03:30.019> but<00:03:30.590> my<00:03:30.709> hair<00:03:30.890> was<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.160> wash<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
I felt like that under color is almost

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.230 
I felt like that under color is almost
not<00:05:45.500> necessary<00:05:46.070> like<00:05:46.250> they<00:05:46.669> make<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:47.000> sound

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
not necessary like they make it sound

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.940 
not necessary like they make it sound
like<00:05:47.479> the<00:05:47.840> color<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.200> going<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.410> be<00:05:48.500> popping

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
like the color is going to be popping

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.219 
like the color is going to be popping
like<00:05:49.039> that<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.310> can<00:05:49.580> barely<00:05:49.940> even<00:05:50.180> see<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.570> the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
like that I can barely even see the the

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.830 
like that I can barely even see the the
lighter<00:05:51.440> color<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.820> mean<00:05:52.970> a<00:05:53.240> number<00:05:53.660> two

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
lighter color so I mean a number two

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.409 
lighter color so I mean a number two
would<00:05:53.960> have<00:05:54.080> probably<00:05:54.320> been<00:05:54.890> pretty<00:05:55.880> good<00:05:56.120> now

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
would have probably been pretty good now

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:57.730 
would have probably been pretty good now
even<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:56.690> number<00:05:56.900> two<00:05:57.080> this<00:05:57.260> is<00:05:57.410> more<00:05:57.590> like<00:05:57.710> a

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
even in number two this is more like a

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.580 
even in number two this is more like a
number<00:05:57.919> four<00:05:58.510> kind<00:05:59.510> of<00:05:59.630> like<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.780> done<00:05:59.960> before<00:05:59.990> I

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
number four kind of like I done before I

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.969 
number four kind of like I done before I
think<00:06:01.340> or<00:06:01.820> number<00:06:02.090> two<00:06:02.240> maybe<00:06:02.800> depends<00:06:03.800> some

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
think or number two maybe depends some

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.800 
think or number two maybe depends some
company<00:06:04.400> that<00:06:04.430> number<00:06:04.789> twos<00:06:05.000> are<00:06:05.210> darker<00:06:05.630> so

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
company that number twos are darker so

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.750 
company that number twos are darker so
I'm<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> little<00:06:06.140> bit<00:06:06.349> lighter<00:06:06.680> so<00:06:07.010> kind<00:06:07.700> just

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
I'm a little bit lighter so kind just

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.340 
I'm a little bit lighter so kind just
kind<00:06:08.030> of

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
kind of

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.960 
kind of
the<00:06:08.590> company<00:06:08.950> but<00:06:09.130> I<00:06:09.160> think<00:06:09.460> our<00:06:09.520> number<00:06:09.730> four

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
the company but I think our number four

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.600 
the company but I think our number four
would<00:06:10.150> be<00:06:10.180> more<00:06:10.570> in<00:06:10.780> the<00:06:11.200> sector<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.830> what<00:06:12.340> this

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
would be more in the sector of what this

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.360 
would be more in the sector of what this
looks<00:06:13.210> like<00:06:13.330> and<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.680> can<00:06:14.890> even<00:06:15.070> see<00:06:15.250> the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
looks like and you can even see the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.930 
looks like and you can even see the
other<00:06:15.400> color<00:06:15.790> like<00:06:16.000> that<00:06:16.830> right<00:06:17.830> I<00:06:18.190> don't<00:06:18.670> know
