00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.390
 Veendam starts sticking out after the game because it's only the third minute 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.610
 interception at veendam and michiel hemmen that can go towards sayyaf 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.929
 goalkeeper van den bos 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.530
 And having safari ticks at an overkort referee is resolutely one 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.059
 Penalty penalty for Veendam 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 the yellow card for sari 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.650
 hit a fall here indeed 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 and therefore a justified decision by overkort 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 sjaak polak is the man of the penalties from veendam 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.679
 he is shooting him badly in the rescue of sari 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.899
 and therefore still 0 0 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.649
 sjaak polak normally it is a penalty always an aquarium this time 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.900
 not 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.180
 at Veendam goes through the orphan migration 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 at the Parisian neighbor Meijer Sjaak Polak comes up well on the left 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.590
 decision to shoot good shot 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.060
 and now it has hit the mark and that's how Veendam stands up 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.980
 head Start 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.289
 one moment mystical 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.670
 the other moment 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.980
 sporty well head polak 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.100
 ball seemed the aussie bit feasible for sari but good veendam stands on it 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 straight one ahead 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.480
 from a good ball interception from polak 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.610
 you play well 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.720
 has the ball he learns 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.830
 abou den berg suddenly 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 what bad shot simply packed by sari 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.830
 then find in the first half hour the much better team the forest is not coming 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 pass 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.700
 so with a team that plays football, and that is good combinations with good space 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 searched as learned here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 the neighbor 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.240
 well the overview 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.730
 that via lip 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.760
 and so Veendam plays nice to get the ball around or the space to play football 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.300
 the members' council what again seems a good combination between lips 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.050
 House 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 because samuel scheimann kicks the ball deep and not over the goal line 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.300
 and therefore a corner for Veendam 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.250
 the bosz always lost the corner of polak second pole loohuis 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.659
 I thought the goal 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.960
 slightly more the way 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 a huge opportunity for veendam 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.330
 but it is still only 0 and so there are still opportunities for the forest 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.019
 we have not seen anything yet any chance for the breast way 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.940
 matusiwa just free 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.389
 and suddenly it's a duck 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.389
 the first chance for the forest it is right 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.629
 matusiwa lost sight of both costs and end 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.309
 he can head in freely 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.539
 that is quite a damper for Veendam and here ball loss ball loss from him 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.699
 a 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.479
 you are not the playmaker 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.089
 ball hits angelo ciman man and the crossbar and first a 2 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.619
 Veendam is the better team for half an hour 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.499
 with a forest it has the lead 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.499
 and with luck 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.049
 if it is in injury time 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.650
 you still get a good chance for veendam set up via patrick lip 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.359
 to neighbor 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.949
 who plays a bit like a concealed striker gives a back to lip 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.009
 to be paid 2 2 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.219
 zaari came out of his goal well 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.719
 and so the breast goes to rest against the relationship with two hours of rest 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.719
 you also see arjan ebbinge who played soccer four years before veendam 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.269
 that the beginning of the second half p then picks up the thread again 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.309
 is the better team again 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.499
 av set up by seintje lips sees that his mail team is coming 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.349
 worse than back and then according to a bad left leg against the defender 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.169
 scheimann 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.649
 and then just as often action on aborah then she gets too much for it 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.969
 another huge opportunity for Veendam and again it is not a goal 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.309
 then a free kick 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.519
 van den bos barakat and that is the el idrissi who can enter the 3j just like that 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.389
 headlines 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.389
 miscommunication in the defense of Veendam 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.329
 five players from the forest fires just free 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.049
 and el idrissi says thank you 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.259
 ditewig is there and looks at it 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.499
 Where are the five minutes played in the second half in Veendam is completely complete 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:56.849
 lost 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.669
 the forest gets the room ouborg advice 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.839
 then what the ciba pole and ditewig 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.169
 Veendam de Zwijnen 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 den bosch could have completely put the game in the slot 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.739
 but after fifteen minutes in the second half that still happens 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.999
 koster missed the ball belong a 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.349
 there is substitute koen van der biezen 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.539
 looks where he plays the ball 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.860
 french o it's four one and the game is over and you would say 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.410
 it is bizarre veendam played great first half but after fifteen minutes 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.840
 in the second half it is just four behind 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.120
 Joop Gall has meanwhile switched Mark Veldmate and has entered the team 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.830
 also luciano dull and therefore more offensive power in the team of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.599
 veendam 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.740
 so also odik chances martijn van der laan he did not get well 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 of such a ball yes they should actually go 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.729
 and then there is still time and there are still chances to come back in the game 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
 maybe here a free kick from veendam the offense was on dompie 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.490
 the man of the free kicks is Sjaak Polak 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.800
 one of the better ones on the Veendam side 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.990
 great free kick 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.419
 skims past the intersection 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.419
 Now Jess does not touch 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.309
 Veendam keeps trying 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.080
 tries to make that connection goal 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 who knows, it might still be possible 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.189
 the ball headed away 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.469
 and on ohl actress cher 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.610
 the ball is not under control and tieleman can make it 4 2 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.620
 there are only six minutes left 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.409
 that is not enough 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.409
 wrongly to come back again 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.379
 zaari can't control the ball 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.349
 and simon can still save the honor 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.349
 Joop Gall also know it's too late 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.629
 after the match 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:54.580
 a good start 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.529
 from veendam 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.349
 but not finished they lose it 4 2
