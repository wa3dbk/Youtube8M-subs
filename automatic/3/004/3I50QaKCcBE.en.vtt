00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pretty straightforward plays the DME on

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
pretty straightforward plays the DME on
the<00:00:19.740> fifth<00:00:19.949> string<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.539> just<00:00:21.539> repeats<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the fifth string and just repeats it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
the fifth string and just repeats it
kind<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> uses<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.849> rhythm<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
kind of like so uses that rhythm and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
kind of like so uses that rhythm and
plays<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.349> i<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.470> around<00:00:28.680> eight<00:00:28.920> times<00:00:29.189> or

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
plays out i think around eight times or

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189 
plays out i think around eight times or
so<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.820> then<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.449> soon<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.630> he<00:00:30.689> finishes<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
so and then as soon as he finishes that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
so and then as soon as he finishes that
he<00:00:31.439> goes<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> verse<00:00:32.369> riff<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
he goes right into the verse riff so the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
he goes right into the verse riff so the
verse<00:00:34.469> riff<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.579> pretty<00:00:35.760> cool<00:00:35.910> starts

and show you how it sounds and then

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
and show you how it sounds and then
we'll<00:00:39.480> break<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.780> down

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.189 

alright<00:00:54.550> so<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.820> break<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.149> down<00:00:55.300> we<00:00:55.660> start<00:00:56.020> on

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
alright so to break it down we start on

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.160 
alright so to break it down we start on
the<00:00:56.800> e<00:00:57.430> note<00:00:58.090> 5th<00:00:58.660> string<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.850> then<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
the e note 5th string and then it's the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.850 
the e note 5th string and then it's the
7th<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.590> 9th<00:01:02.739> fret<00:01:02.860> on<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.040> g<00:01:03.220> string<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
7th and 9th fret on the g string so

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
7th and 9th fret on the g string so
basically<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.850> 7th<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.210> 9th<00:01:07.420> fret<00:01:07.630> stayed

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
basically the 7th to 9th fret stayed

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
basically the 7th to 9th fret stayed
pretty<00:01:08.380> constant<00:01:08.950> throughout<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> riff<00:01:09.490> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
pretty constant throughout the riff and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.469 
pretty constant throughout the riff and
the<00:01:10.869> root<00:01:11.020> node<00:01:11.200> keeps<00:01:11.440> changing<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:13.330> start

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
the root node keeps changing so we start

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.020 
the root node keeps changing so we start
on<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.750> E<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.890> then<00:01:18.070> we<00:01:18.190> move<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.460> D<00:01:18.700> so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
on the E and then we move to the D so

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.010 
on the E and then we move to the D so
it's<00:01:19.149> an<00:01:19.240> open<00:01:19.570> D<00:01:20.140> string<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.690> move<00:01:25.840> down

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
it's an open D string then we move down

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.540 
it's an open D string then we move down
to<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.229> beyond<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.710> sixth<00:01:26.979> string<00:01:27.160> which<00:01:27.399> she

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
to the beyond the sixth string which she

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.960 
to the beyond the sixth string which she
frets<00:01:27.850> with<00:01:27.970> his<00:01:28.090> thumb<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
frets with his thumb and then it's the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:54.399 
frets with his thumb and then it's the
sea<00:01:34.210> on<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.390> sixth<00:01:34.630> string<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:39.940> together

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.929 

last<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> plays<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.100> verse<00:01:56.369> he

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
last time you plays the verse he

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.370 
last time you plays the verse he
actually<00:01:57.060> ends<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> c<00:01:57.780> major<00:01:57.899> seven<00:01:58.200> chord

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
actually ends on the c major seven chord

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:12.199 
actually ends on the c major seven chord
so<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.829> sounds<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.130> this<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:12.030> he's<00:02:12.180> uh

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so it sounds like this so he's uh

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.570 
so it sounds like this so he's uh
fretting<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.930> root<00:02:13.170> note<00:02:13.349> with<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:14.459> his

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
fretting the root note with with his

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.059 
fretting the root note with with his
thumb<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.060> sea<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.319> uh<00:02:17.180> from<00:02:18.180> nine

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
thumb the sea and then it's uh from nine

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.759 
thumb the sea and then it's uh from nine
eight<00:02:20.069> seven<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> your<00:02:22.200> fingers<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:22.620> sore

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769

than<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> diagonal<00:02:23.519> role<00:02:24.120> yet<00:02:28.010> um<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
than I in a diagonal role yet um when I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
than I in a diagonal role yet um when I
seen<00:02:29.640> him<00:02:29.700> alive<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.349> videos<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.650> I've

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
seen him alive and the videos that I've

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.130 
seen him alive and the videos that I've
seen<00:02:32.069> he<00:02:32.940> actually<00:02:33.090> improvises<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> lot<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
seen he actually improvises a lot in the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.720 
seen he actually improvises a lot in the
verse<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.620> throws<00:02:34.860> him<00:02:35.010> some<00:02:35.190> other<00:02:35.250> note<00:02:35.519> so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
verse and throws him some other note so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:50.570 
verse and throws him some other note so
it<00:02:35.819> sounds<00:02:36.060> something<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.299> this

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.070 

so<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.670> obvious<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.030> lot<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.690> know<00:02:52.810> fun

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
so the obvious you a lot of you know fun

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.150 
so the obvious you a lot of you know fun
stuff<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.440> could<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.650> with<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.040> just

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
stuff you could do with it and just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.060 
stuff you could do with it and just
improvise<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.640> throw<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.090> some<00:02:55.210> extra<00:02:55.300> notes

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
improvise and throw in some extra notes

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.440 
improvise and throw in some extra notes
so<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.160> next<00:02:57.280> part<00:02:57.460> of<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.640> song<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.210> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
so the next part of the song is the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.390 
so the next part of the song is the
chorus<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.050> quarter<00:02:59.350> starts<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> G

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
chorus so the quarter starts on the G
