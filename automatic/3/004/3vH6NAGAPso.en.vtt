00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.410 
can add a little bit of water and what
I'll<00:02:06.340> probably<00:02:06.369> do<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.179> put<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.360> little

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
I'll probably do is just put a little

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.660 
I'll probably do is just put a little
bit<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.689> water<00:02:07.869> inside<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.470> here<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.340> I'll<00:02:09.579> be

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
bit of water inside of here so I'll be

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.520 
bit of water inside of here so I'll be
right<00:02:09.819> back<00:02:09.940> okay<00:02:11.579> so<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:13.140> put<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:14.319> bit<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
right back okay so I put a little bit of

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.130 
right back okay so I put a little bit of
water<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.950> here<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.959> get<00:02:17.079> any

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
water in here so I can so it can get any

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.170 
water in here so I can so it can get any
remainder<00:02:17.859> of<00:02:17.889> the<00:02:18.190> chicken<00:02:18.910> broth<00:02:19.030> that's
