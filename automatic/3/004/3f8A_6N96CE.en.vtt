that<00:00:06.480> small<00:00:06.750> hive<00:00:07.140> beetle<00:00:07.170> will<00:00:07.799> get<00:00:08.010> into<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
that small hive beetle will get into and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.310 
that small hive beetle will get into and
you<00:00:09.179> will<00:00:09.300> begin<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.719> small<00:00:10.080> hive<00:00:10.290> beetle

you will begin to have small hive beetle

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.169 
you will begin to have small hive beetle
problems<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:12.059> crash<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> hive<00:00:12.950> why

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
problems and that can crash a hive why

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.970 
problems and that can crash a hive why
invite<00:00:15.179> trouble<00:00:15.710> just<00:00:16.710> give<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:18.770> now<00:00:19.770> let's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
bit wider so this is a honey bar but I'm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
bit wider so this is a honey bar but I'm
using<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:38.000> collapsed<00:00:39.000> cone<00:00:39.210> bar<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.320> when

using it as a collapsed cone bar so when

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.030 
using it as a collapsed cone bar so when
I<00:00:40.500> did<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> cutout<00:00:41.510> Saturday<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.559> hive

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I did the cutout Saturday of that hive

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.180 
I did the cutout Saturday of that hive
that<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> camper<00:00:45.120> trailer<00:00:46.010> when<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> was

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

that was in a camper trailer when I was
cutting<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> brood<00:00:47.670> comb<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.899> putting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
cutting the brood comb out I was putting

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.420 
cutting the brood comb out I was putting
the<00:00:49.260> brood<00:00:49.469> comb<00:00:50.510> inside<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.129> grabbing<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the brood comb inside this grabbing it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
the brood comb inside this grabbing it
and<00:00:53.579> hang<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> hive<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.379> bees<00:00:55.620> will

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and hang it in the hive the bees will

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
and hang it in the hive the bees will
reattach<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.699> over<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> course<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> week

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
reattach it over the course of a week
and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.250> cut<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and then I can cut this thing out and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
and then I can cut this thing out and
remove<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.620> part<00:01:02.010> double<00:01:02.640> built<00:01:02.850> around<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
remove this part double built around it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
remove this part double built around it
but<00:01:03.570> I'll<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> damage

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but I'll just do a little bit of damage

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
but I'll just do a little bit of damage
to<00:01:04.949> pull<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.820> it'll<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> normal

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to pull that out and it'll be a normal

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.469 
to pull that out and it'll be a normal
bar<00:01:06.810> again<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.150> try

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
bar again now I'm also going to try

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
bar again now I'm also going to try
another<00:01:09.869> type<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> bar<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.470> show<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
another type of bar that I will show you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.380 
another type of bar that I will show you
in<00:01:14.189> part<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:14.970> video

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
in part of this video

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.180 
in part of this video
as<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.200> drill<00:01:18.440> holes<00:01:18.680> here<00:01:19.010> and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
as I'm going to drill holes here and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.360 
as I'm going to drill holes here and
here<00:01:21.580> use<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.610> dowel<00:01:23.410> put<00:01:24.410> in<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.680> down<00:01:24.860> here<00:01:25.100> put

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
here use a dowel put in a down here put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.040 
here use a dowel put in a down here put
in<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.550> Dell<00:01:25.730> here<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.180> then<00:01:26.750> put<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:26.990> a

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
in the Dell here and then put in a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.090 
in the Dell here and then put in a
crossbeam<00:01:27.590> here

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
crossbeam here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.980 
crossbeam here
and<00:01:28.220> it's<00:01:28.940> going<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.150> be<00:01:29.300> another<00:01:29.660> type<00:01:29.960> of

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and it's going to be another type of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.090 
and it's going to be another type of
cutout<00:01:30.800> bar<00:01:31.640> designed<00:01:32.300> for<00:01:32.420> cutouts<00:01:33.100> because

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
cutout bar designed for cutouts because

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.900 
cutout bar designed for cutouts because
the<00:01:34.880> top<00:01:35.600> bars<00:01:35.900> are<00:01:36.170> really<00:01:36.260> poor<00:01:37.220> for<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> cut

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
the top bars are really poor for a cut

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.600 
the top bars are really poor for a cut
out<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.900> legs<00:01:39.200> beat<00:01:39.590> them<00:01:39.770> hands<00:01:40.010> down<00:01:40.310> with

out the legs beat them hands down with

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.800 
out the legs beat them hands down with
the<00:01:40.820> swarm<00:01:41.330> catching<00:01:42.280> frames<00:01:43.280> they've<00:01:43.520> got

the swarm catching frames they've got

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.090 
the swarm catching frames they've got
alright<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:45.140> I'm<00:01:45.440> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> continue<00:01:45.950> on
