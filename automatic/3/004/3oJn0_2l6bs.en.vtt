 wheel the weapons are in our place 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.490
 For example, we have 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.340

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.250
 the decade we bought at 15 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.239
 clear as the 1.5 good as they see the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.629
 record of the house results this is the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.000

 a chest terms like plantang langley 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.489
 It's a lot of recording, obviously, it's going down 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.459
 a bit the tps struch and sima the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.040
 side collection veron was created good me 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.069
 they put one as the six see 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.310
 now they are random 11 we do not 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.610
 choose us and for example this one if they are 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.690
 all the same but if you choose from thesis 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.590
 they put you all random holograms 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.420
 to say 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.060
 signs it looks really good I'm not when 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.950
 a media graphics to record says very 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.200
 well other things that you can observe 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.379
 it can be on the radar as you can see 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.390
 red dots that would be the enemies 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.609
 but it does not mark you during the elimination 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.720
 or that you mark the enemies that see your 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.330
 companions 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.520
 you kill yourself or you're marked with 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.270
 little red dots from afar 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.340
 where are the 500 companions 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.710
 another one of the weird things on the menu 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.600
 buyers was showing the cans and how 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.270
 there are always a couple of triples now what 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.830
 I show but I have chin this is a 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.990
 Awful little column 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.880
 it's not common or you can 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:37.090
 the management worsened 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.370
 so let's show the rich and good 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.470
 There are many who eat cabbage 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.920
 I do not know what they did to him but well we're going to 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.920
 keep the click without maintaining without 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.860
 control the record do in this I 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.770
 it seems very good but now as now 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.280
 We are not your land when you try 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.890
 to try them and on the internet the bullets and 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.890
 we're going to china to 1 points success 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.329
 to ahli and such and robots is so difficult and 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.689
 they are one that is tremendous good it was like 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.340
 see in the fuse we can change 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.350
 weapon while we merge that is good 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.660
 heaps we can recharge as in point 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.360
 zero could be and well there are differences 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.340
 there is differentiation in the map on the map 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.350
 of structures that showed the grenades 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.259
 we have the incendiary that fell in love 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:39.970
 all the tier what it does is simulate 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.970
 good for you to listen 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.169
 we have a hit 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.720
 with the lure face 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.289
 if we have cast when I go back to 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.620
 loans when we are in effect in 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.620
 The vote 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.780
 good that we have in the while 4 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:27.220
 if I suffer and show you from here what 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.220
 is this track 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.800
 the bullet 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.440
 this guy like a world 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.150
 shoots electricity also kill from 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.150
 Fruits are not in the same mode 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.190
