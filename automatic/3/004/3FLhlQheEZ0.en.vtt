so<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:29.520> example<00:04:29.610> when<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.060> geared<00:04:30.389> out<00:04:30.509> in

so for example when I geared out in

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.070 
so for example when I geared out in
battle<00:04:31.080> master<00:04:31.229> p<00:04:31.620> 1.2<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.460> got<00:04:33.330> gear<00:04:33.750> first

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
battle master p 1.2 I got gear first

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.529 
battle master p 1.2 I got gear first
that<00:04:34.410> was<00:04:34.680> very<00:04:34.979> power<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:37.370> surge

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
that was very power and a surge

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.839 
that was very power and a surge
dependent<00:04:39.539> now<00:04:40.260> all<00:04:40.560> gear<00:04:40.830> has<00:04:40.979> expertise<00:04:41.520> so

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849

expertise but you're gonna want to get

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.300 
expertise but you're gonna want to get
geared<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.970> has<00:04:48.180> more<00:04:48.900> power<00:04:49.169> or<00:04:49.650> more<00:04:49.979> surge

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
geared that has more power or more surge

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.089 
geared that has more power or more surge
and<00:04:50.729> that's<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.330> because<00:04:51.570> i<00:04:52.110> believe<00:04:52.949> for

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
and that's just because i believe for

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.930 
and that's just because i believe for
every<00:04:53.340> SPECT<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.330> sentinel<00:04:54.990> class<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.940> lot

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
every SPECT of the sentinel class a lot

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.510 
every SPECT of the sentinel class a lot
of<00:04:57.030> our<00:04:57.150> moves<00:04:57.419> rely<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.320> lot<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.070> our<00:04:59.220> damage

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
of our moves rely on a lot of our damage

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.779 
of our moves rely on a lot of our damage
relies<00:04:59.789> on<00:05:00.440> automatic<00:05:01.440> crits<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:02.580> get

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
relies on automatic crits and to get

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.760 
relies on automatic crits and to get
those<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.389> get<00:05:03.509> more<00:05:03.690> damage<00:05:03.990> out<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.199> those

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
those to get more damage out of those

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.050 
those to get more damage out of those
crits<00:05:05.070> we're<00:05:05.370> going<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.550> need<00:05:05.639> more<00:05:05.789> search

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
crits we're going to need more search

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.469 
crits we're going to need more search
and<00:05:06.389> power<00:05:07.880> therefore<00:05:08.880> you're<00:05:09.120> going<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> want

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
and power therefore you're going to want

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.060 
and power therefore you're going to want
to<00:05:09.599> look<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.320> gear<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.740> gives<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:10.979> the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
to look for the gear that gives you the

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.469 
to look for the gear that gives you the
most<00:05:11.159> power<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.580> surge<00:05:11.789> in<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.000> beginning<00:05:12.389> and

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
most power in surge in the beginning and

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.290 
most power in surge in the beginning and
then<00:05:13.199> gear<00:05:14.070> up<00:05:14.099> from<00:05:15.090> there<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:17.090> that's<00:05:18.090> kind

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
then gear up from there so that's kind

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.170 
then gear up from there so that's kind
of<00:05:18.330> that's<00:05:18.720> kind<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.020> my<00:05:19.320> uh<00:05:19.759> my<00:05:20.759> little<00:05:20.789> guide

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
of that's kind of my uh my little guide

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.370 
of that's kind of my uh my little guide
to<00:05:21.479> gearing<00:05:21.930> up<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.530> PvP<00:05:23.310> in<00:05:23.520> general<00:05:24.380> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
to gearing up for PvP in general that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.020 
to gearing up for PvP in general that
what<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:25.860> just<00:05:26.099> said<00:05:26.250> translates<00:05:26.789> to<00:05:26.909> all

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
what I just said translates to all

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.249 
what I just said translates to all
classes<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:29.419> trooper<00:05:30.419> gear<00:05:30.599> costs<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.050> same

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
classes so trooper gear costs the same

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.950 
classes so trooper gear costs the same
as<00:05:31.370> Sentinel<00:05:32.370> gear<00:05:32.580> as<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:32.789> Jedi<00:05:33.180> gear<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.720> and
