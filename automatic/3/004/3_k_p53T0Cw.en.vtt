00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
demonstration purposes so it's easier to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
demonstration purposes so it's easier to
videotape<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.500> show<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> roller

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
videotape and show how to get the roller

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
videotape and show how to get the roller
out<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> pickup

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
out so this right here is the pickup

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
out so this right here is the pickup
roller<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.509> separation<00:02:04.110> roller<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.500> down

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
roller and the separation roller is down

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200 
roller and the separation roller is down
here<00:02:05.040> these<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:05.610> pieces<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.119> will

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
here these are the two pieces that will

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419 
here these are the two pieces that will
get<00:02:06.329> replaced<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> do

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
get replaced in this what you want to do

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.760 
get replaced in this what you want to do
is<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.539> roller<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.410> probably

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is with this roller here it's probably

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.960 
is with this roller here it's probably
gonna<00:02:10.860> take<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.129> hands<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
gonna take two hands to do it or if you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.070 
gonna take two hands to do it or if you
have<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> little<00:02:12.330> flathead<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:12.959> in

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
have a little flathead you can get in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
have a little flathead you can get in
there

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
there

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.900 
there
you<00:02:13.840> want<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.170> pry<00:02:14.680> back<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.100> each<00:02:15.250> side<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
you want to pry back on each side of the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.510 
you want to pry back on each side of the
white<00:02:16.330> plastic<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> top<00:02:18.130> here<00:02:18.490> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
white plastic up in the top here and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
white plastic up in the top here and
then<00:02:18.940> kind<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.390> pull<00:02:19.630> back<00:02:19.660> towards<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
then kind of pull back towards you this

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
then kind of pull back towards you this
roller<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.640> u-shape<00:02:22.120> you'll<00:02:22.270> see<00:02:22.420> when<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.570> get

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
roller to u-shape you'll see when I get

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.810 
roller to u-shape you'll see when I get
it<00:02:22.840> out<00:02:22.930> there<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> come<00:02:24.610> down

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
it out there it's going to come down

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.730 
it out there it's going to come down
once<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.450> pulls<00:02:25.600> down<00:02:25.810> about<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.170> half-inch<00:02:26.590> up

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
once it pulls down about a half-inch up

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.600 
once it pulls down about a half-inch up
so<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> should<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.070> able<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.250> pull<00:02:27.340> prints

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
so you should be able to pull prints

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
so you should be able to pull prints
straight<00:02:27.910> back<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.870> u-shaped

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
straight back at you but it's a u-shaped

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.620 
straight back at you but it's a u-shaped
roller<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.070> see<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:31.030> sitting

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
roller as you can see so it's sitting

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.940 
roller as you can see so it's sitting
like<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.620> you're<00:02:32.710> basically

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
like this on there and you're basically

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
like this on there and you're basically
unsnapping<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.910> pulling<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
unsnapping it and pulling it out the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.660 
unsnapping it and pulling it out the
replacement<00:02:35.650> will<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.950> reversal<00:02:36.520> that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
replacement will be the reversal that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.220 
replacement will be the reversal that
but<00:02:36.850> before<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.240> put<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.480> roller<00:02:37.780> on<00:02:38.050> you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
but before you put this roller on you

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.740 
but before you put this roller on you
then<00:02:38.470> want<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.770> remove<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:40.120> separation

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
then want to remove the separation

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
then want to remove the separation
roller<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.410> separation<00:02:42.010> rollers<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> little

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
roller the separation rollers a little

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.740 
roller the separation rollers a little
bit<00:02:42.640> trickier<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> little<00:02:43.420> hard<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.660> get

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
bit trickier it's a little hard to get

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.630 
bit trickier it's a little hard to get
out<00:02:43.930> there's<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.620> plastic<00:02:44.860> shield<00:02:45.400> here

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
out there's a little plastic shield here

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
out there's a little plastic shield here
that<00:02:45.790> needs<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.120> flipped<00:02:46.450> open<00:02:46.600> off<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that needs to be flipped open off so you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.260 
that needs to be flipped open off so you
can<00:02:47.800> actually<00:02:47.860> grab<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.820> your<00:02:48.940> fingers

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
can actually grab that with your fingers

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.570 
can actually grab that with your fingers
and<00:02:49.480> if<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.660> pull<00:02:49.900> back<00:02:50.110> slightly<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.340> top

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and if you pull back slightly on the top

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.880 
and if you pull back slightly on the top
center<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.330> will<00:02:52.420> flip<00:02:52.720> open<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.290> it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
center of it it will flip open and it's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.350 
center of it it will flip open and it's
a<00:02:53.980> hinged<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> little<00:02:55.090> plastic

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
a hinged it's like a little plastic

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.900 
a hinged it's like a little plastic
hinged<00:02:55.900> door<00:02:56.200> basically<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.130> once<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.460> pops<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
hinged door basically so once it pops it

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.910 
hinged door basically so once it pops it
will<00:02:58.000> snap<00:02:58.840> back<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.260> want<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.500> basically

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
will snap back you want to basically

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040 
will snap back you want to basically
rotate<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:01.360> want<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.570> put<00:03:01.660> your<00:03:01.780> fingers

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
rotate this you want to put your fingers

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.600 
rotate this you want to put your fingers
underneath<00:03:02.410> 3cs<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.160> black<00:03:03.370> ledge

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
underneath 3cs a little black ledge

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.770 
underneath 3cs a little black ledge
right<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:04.180> where<00:03:04.360> there's<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> little<00:03:04.660> bit<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
right here where there's a little bit of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.410 
right here where there's a little bit of
a<00:03:04.870> gap<00:03:05.080> where<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> roller<00:03:05.770> is<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:07.240> easiest

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
a gap where the roller is the easiest

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.310 
a gap where the roller is the easiest
thing<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.750> put<00:03:07.900> both<00:03:08.110> thumbs

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
thing to do is put both thumbs

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.990 
thing to do is put both thumbs
underneath<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> your<00:03:09.310> four<00:03:09.550> fingers

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
underneath of it and your four fingers

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420 
underneath of it and your four fingers
on<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.840> sides<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.380> then<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.070> kind<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.280> lift

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
on the sides and then just kind of lift

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.620 
on the sides and then just kind of lift
up<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.640> both<00:03:12.790> sides<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.270> see<00:03:13.420> how<00:03:13.570> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
up on both sides and you see how the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.970 
up on both sides and you see how the
roller<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.140> kind<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.350> pulled<00:03:14.590> forward<00:03:14.920> a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
roller just kind of pulled forward a

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.200 
roller just kind of pulled forward a
little<00:03:15.100> bit<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.550> pull<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.850> down<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
little bit if you pull this down the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.970 
little bit if you pull this down the
rest<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.480> way<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:17.320> roller<00:03:17.650> will<00:03:17.830> come

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
rest of the way that roller will come

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.940 
rest of the way that roller will come
right<00:03:18.190> out<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.200> hardest<00:03:20.470> part<00:03:20.590> to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
right out this is the hardest part to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.130 
right out this is the hardest part to
replacing<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> go<00:03:22.930> right

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
replacing this this is going to go right

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.110 
replacing this this is going to go right
back<00:03:23.290> into<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> same<00:03:23.800> slotted<00:03:24.280> groove<00:03:24.520> that

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
back into the same slotted groove that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.050 
back into the same slotted groove that
it<00:03:25.239> came<00:03:25.420> out<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.020> new<00:03:26.380> one<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.850> want<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
it came out of the new one you want to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.640 
it came out of the new one you want to
put<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.270> in<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.870> then<00:03:29.080> wanna<00:03:29.290> make<00:03:29.380> sure<00:03:29.500> it's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
put it in you then wanna make sure it's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.410 
put it in you then wanna make sure it's
this<00:03:29.709> little<00:03:29.980> door<00:03:30.160> here<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:31.000> click<00:03:31.180> this

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
this little door here you click this

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.000 
this little door here you click this
back<00:03:31.570> in<00:03:31.720> place<00:03:31.930> you'll<00:03:32.380> hear<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.620> snap<00:03:32.770> when

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
back in place you'll hear it snap when

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.130 
back in place you'll hear it snap when
it<00:03:33.130> goes<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.640> then<00:03:34.239> this<00:03:34.390> roller<00:03:34.720> there's

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
it goes in and then this roller there's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.750 
it goes in and then this roller there's
a<00:03:35.230> section<00:03:35.739> here<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:35.920> want<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.190> use<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.459> part

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
a section here you want to use this part

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.430 
a section here you want to use this part
right<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:36.970> where<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.480> got<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.870> larger

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
right here where it's got this larger

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.380 
right here where it's got this larger
bump<00:03:38.770> down<00:03:39.070> near<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.310> bottom<00:03:39.550> side<00:03:39.910> that's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
bump down near the bottom side that's

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.490 
bump down near the bottom side that's
the<00:03:40.570> side<00:03:40.720> that's<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.110> hook<00:03:41.260> into

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the side that's going to hook into

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.620 
the side that's going to hook into
little<00:03:42.430> cutouts<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.030> bottom<00:03:43.390> of<00:03:43.480> this

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
little cutouts on the bottom of this

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.270 
little cutouts on the bottom of this
wheel<00:03:44.230> right<00:03:44.260> here<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.070> see<00:03:45.220> these

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
wheel right here you can see these

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.770 
wheel right here you can see these
little<00:03:45.519> cutouts<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.060> that's<00:03:46.300> these<00:03:46.630> are

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
little cutouts and that's these are

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.060 
little cutouts and that's these are
going<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.989> go<00:03:47.080> these<00:03:47.320> are<00:03:47.380> going<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.650> start<00:03:47.890> in

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
going to go these are going to start in

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.040 
going to go these are going to start in
there<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.790> you're<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.120> go<00:03:49.269> down<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.780> an

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
there so you're going to go down at an

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.910 
there so you're going to go down at an
angle<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:51.989> get<00:03:52.989> those<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.230> there<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.769> see

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
angle you get those in there you can see

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.810 
angle you get those in there you can see
it<00:03:54.010> there<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.430> they're<00:03:54.670> just

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
it there like that and they're just

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.220 
it there like that and they're just
going<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.030> kind<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.300> push<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.540> rotate<00:03:56.080> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
going to kind of push and rotate the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.170 
going to kind of push and rotate the
roller<00:03:56.470> up<00:03:56.709> until<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.370> clicks<00:03:57.640> back<00:03:57.730> into

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
roller up until it clicks back into

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.270 
roller up until it clicks back into
place<00:03:58.420> you've<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.440> replaced<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.980> pickup

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
place you've just replaced the pickup

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.860 
place you've just replaced the pickup
roller<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.880> separation<00:04:01.390> roller<00:04:01.600> on<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
roller and the separation roller on the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.370 
roller and the separation roller on the
CP<00:04:02.650> 2025<00:04:03.550> once<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.660> have<00:04:04.780> those<00:04:04.900> rollers<00:04:05.230> back

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
CP 2025 once you have those rollers back

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.320 
CP 2025 once you have those rollers back
in<00:04:05.560> place<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:06.010> can<00:04:06.190> reset<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.730> position<00:04:06.970> of

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
in place you can reset the position of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.030 
in place you can reset the position of
that<00:04:07.450> roller<00:04:07.690> just<00:04:08.019> by<00:04:08.200> plugging<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.769> printer

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
that roller just by plugging the printer

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640 
that roller just by plugging the printer
back<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.430> when<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.420> powers<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.410> roller

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
back in when it powers on the roller

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.320 
back in when it powers on the roller
will<00:04:11.830> turn<00:04:11.980> itself<00:04:12.250> around<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.880> be<00:04:13.060> timed

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
will turn itself around and be timed

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.759 
will turn itself around and be timed
correctly<00:04:13.570> then<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.230> you'll<00:04:14.440> be<00:04:14.530> able<00:04:14.620> to

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
correctly then so you'll be able to

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.000 
correctly then so you'll be able to
print<00:04:14.980> once<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> machine<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:15.670> ready
