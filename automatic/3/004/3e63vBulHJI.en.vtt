an email think about if I had one point

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
an email think about if I had one point
to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> next<00:01:08.580> Arizona<00:01:09.290> gaps<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.619> widgets<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to the next Arizona gaps for widgets you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.649 
to the next Arizona gaps for widgets you
can<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.810> actually

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.090 

so<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.170> mean<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> seven<00:01:22.979> inch

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
IPS display its probe a 1280 by 800 so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
IPS display its probe a 1280 by 800 so
we're<00:01:26.880> used<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> size<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.770> take<00:01:29.159> a
