else you can't stretch it out underneath

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.039 
else you can't stretch it out underneath
it'll<00:03:41.940> try<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.090> stretch<00:03:42.359> out<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.630> big<00:03:42.810> box

it'll try and stretch out the big box
instead<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:44.340> once<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.639> done<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:44.910> come

obviously<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> dimensions<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.030> don't

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
obviously the dimensions of this don't

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.170 
obviously the dimensions of this don't
fit<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.079> just<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> position<00:04:02.180> I'll

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
fit so you just go to the position I'll

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.220 
fit so you just go to the position I'll
try<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.450> drag<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:03.720> over<00:04:03.840> here<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.170> guys

try and drag this over here so you guys
can<00:04:04.410> see<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.680> that's<00:04:05.340> not<00:04:05.489> gonna<00:04:05.609> work<00:04:07.190> there

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
can see it that's not gonna work there

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.520 
can see it that's not gonna work there
you<00:04:08.310> go<00:04:08.370> fishing<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.510> you'll<00:04:10.079> just<00:04:10.319> scale

that out again try and find a way to
make<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.419> fit<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.919> crop<00:04:14.220> sides<00:04:14.669> left

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
dimensions of this one are F and I'm not

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.229 
dimensions of this one are F and I'm not
gonna<00:04:20.099> fiddle<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.549> too<00:04:20.760> long<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.120> I'm

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239

just saying like see that's how you can

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.050 
just saying like see that's how you can
shrink<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:22.979> your<00:04:23.220> caster<00:04:23.789> camera

there and for those who don't know how

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.530 
there and for those who don't know how
to<00:04:25.830> do<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.159> can<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.460> simply<00:04:26.580> take

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
to do that you can just simply take

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540 
to do that you can just simply take
screen<00:04:27.930> region<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.650> Skype<00:04:28.890> camera<00:04:29.430> or

again once you're done setting the
webcams<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.360> know<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.540> can<00:04:33.660> reposition<00:04:33.840> it

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
webcams you know you can reposition it

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
obviously I'll move this a little bit

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.540 
obviously I'll move this a little bit
because<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:40.800> not<00:04:40.860> quite<00:04:41.190> where<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.340> want<00:04:41.520> it

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
because it's not quite where I want it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.170 
because it's not quite where I want it
to<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.610> what<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.820> set<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.090> ahead
