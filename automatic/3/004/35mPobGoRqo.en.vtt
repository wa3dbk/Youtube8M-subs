00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello youtube friends in the video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.520
 today I bring you how to download games 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.990
 for the p esp emulator of android together 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.420
 what we are going to do is go to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.010
 browser 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.650
 of the cell that comes by default 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.070
 then I had already gotten 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.140
 prior to the page then in the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.740
 page will appear more or less that if 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.240
 they do it from the cell phone and there they will tell us 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.910
 download as you can see here 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.739
 he did not download it because I already have the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 game but after we've 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.640
 download has already finished downloading 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.670
 has not skipped a file like these 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.910
 as you can see here where they are less 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.170
 downloaded in this folder as they can 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.610
 see here I have three of them from the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.680
 war 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.030
 z then what we are going to do is give it 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.090
 unzip it will decompress the evil 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 is that it weighs less as you can see is what 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.080
 ok weird in the little arrow that appears 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.730
 up 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 about writing without asking 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.110
 and I'll wait to see it unzip 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 I hope it does not delay weighs 168 megabytes or 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 is not really not that much 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.250
 game 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 let's wait for you to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.060
 ar decompress 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.500
 647 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 good practices has decompressed 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 called psp games 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 with this folder that we create we put 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.119
 all the files that we want after 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 of having downloaded the games after 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.310
 just put the floors and then they are the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.649
 files that with the names that are left 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.929
 the files that we unzip and in the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.120
 game emulator that I'll show you 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.830
 right away that is depending 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.460
 they tell me to be able to solve the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.400
 problem thank you I like the video 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.740
 Share with your friends for tutorials 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.170
 for your conventions is 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.650
 on your cell phone in my case I have the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.260
 assumed as they saw already finished of 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 unzip the file then what 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.459
 let's do is select the folder 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.090
 as you can see here is the file 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.069
 I give in move 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 As you can see here I already have the folder 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.709
 created that says the game is p esp the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 selected and I give ok but I already the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.470
 had previously then just you 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.060
 applies to all the overwrite 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.850
 I'll show you the little one 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.100
 gameplay of the game 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.710
 but another one of that game because actually 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.230
 I did not like it enough, just download it 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.850
 because it did not weigh much I'll show you the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.850
 of god of war 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.230
 loaded state 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.319
 the game is in English for those who do not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.319
 they knew it and I removed the sound too 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.340
 as you can see in the game 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.340
 and the monster ends 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.640
 as to the population 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.629
 good as you could see it works 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.329
 really in everything we're going to do 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.390
 it's just what it shows them in the video 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.360
 the limits that they use I will leave them 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.000
 in the description of the video also in 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.260
 the pk of the emulator that is paying you if 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.489
 have any doubt leave me your 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.489
 comment please thanks
