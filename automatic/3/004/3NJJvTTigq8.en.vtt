00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
at fast enough and the reason for this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
at fast enough and the reason for this
is<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> those<00:01:12.240> pre<00:01:12.510> orders<00:01:12.840> were

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is because all of those pre orders were

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200 
is because all of those pre orders were
fake<00:01:13.290> ones<00:01:13.560> by<00:01:13.710> scalpers<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.400> were<00:01:14.460> scalpers

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
at the nintendo world store and there

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.800 
at the nintendo world store and there
were<00:03:14.310> people<00:03:14.670> at<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> nintendo<00:03:15.510> world<00:03:15.630> store

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
were people at the nintendo world store

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.980 
were people at the nintendo world store
not<00:03:16.380> able<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:16.980> them<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.850> nintendo<00:03:18.810> was

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
not able to get them so nintendo was

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.080 
not able to get them so nintendo was
simply<00:03:19.380> i<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:20.220> they<00:03:20.340> were<00:03:20.400> creating<00:03:20.880> demand

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
simply i think they were creating demand

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.670 
simply i think they were creating demand
because<00:03:21.270> they<00:03:21.510> had<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.720> many<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.530> their

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
because they had so many in their

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
because they had so many in their
warehouses<00:03:23.130> they<00:03:24.120> had<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.810> many<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.200> these

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
warehouses they had so many of these

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.860 
warehouses they had so many of these
games<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:26.340> they<00:03:26.820> really<00:03:27.360> should<00:03:27.600> have<00:03:27.690> had

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
games that they really should have had

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.170 
games that they really should have had
no<00:03:28.290> reason<00:03:28.890> other<00:03:29.040> than<00:03:29.490> if<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.820> was<00:03:29.970> some

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
no reason other than if there was some

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.940 
no reason other than if there was some
kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.510> shipping<00:03:30.930> fluke<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.440> they<00:03:31.650> didn't

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
kind of shipping fluke that they didn't

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.030 
kind of shipping fluke that they didn't
mention<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.930> what<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.440> could<00:03:34.800> be

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
mention so that is what they could be

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.480 
mention so that is what they could be
doing<00:03:35.070> right<00:03:35.370> now<00:03:35.670> they<00:03:36.090> could<00:03:36.360> also<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.200> i

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
doing right now they could also and i

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.110 
doing right now they could also and i
really<00:03:38.490> hope<00:03:39.210> this<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.080> true<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:41.120> they

sell all of them that they produced

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.890 
sell all of them that they produced
which<00:04:09.420> would<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:10.070> terrible<00:04:11.070> but<00:04:11.700> at<00:04:12.060> least<00:04:12.540> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
which would be terrible but at least in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.620 
which would be terrible but at least in
that<00:04:13.200> case<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.709> would<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.580> completely<00:04:15.060> break

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
they would have created all of this

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.550 
they would have created all of this
scalping<00:04:39.370> problem<00:04:40.290> single-handedly<00:04:41.290> it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
scalping problem single-handedly it

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.010
