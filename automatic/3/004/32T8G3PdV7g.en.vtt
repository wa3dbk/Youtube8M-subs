00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the match and break it down from a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.970 
the match and break it down from a
betting<00:00:26.760> perspective<00:00:27.380> but<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.949> are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
betting perspective but I don't what are

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.450 
betting perspective but I don't what are
you<00:00:29.099> expecting<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> pitch<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
you expecting to see on the pitch I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
you expecting to see on the pitch I
think<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.930> good<00:00:33.989> game

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
think it's going to be a very good game

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
think it's going to be a very good game
between<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.790> teams<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.450> top<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
between the two teams that are on top of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.100 
between the two teams that are on top of
primarily<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> believe<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
primarily and that I believe that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.270 
primarily and that I believe that
possible<00:00:40.110> will<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> first<00:00:42.780> tube

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
possible will be the also the first tube

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
possible will be the also the first tube
on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> end<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> season<00:00:45.090> possible<00:00:45.780> United

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
on the end of the season possible United

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.970 
on the end of the season possible United
can<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> place<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:48.090> word<00:00:48.980> vs

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
can can have a place there a word vs

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.750 
can can have a place there a word vs
arsenal<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.149> second<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> expect

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
arsenal for four second one so I expect

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880 
arsenal for four second one so I expect
to<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:54.090> hard<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.469> both<00:00:55.620> teams

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to really hard game for for both teams

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
to really hard game for for both teams
and<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:58.250> think<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> both<00:00:59.699> Bulls<00:01:00.120> coach<00:01:00.390> here

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and I think that both Bulls coach here

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I think that both Bulls coach here
know<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.800> important<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:03.090> lose<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
know how important is to not lose the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.640 
know how important is to not lose the
game<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.439> then

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
game and so we can have it here and then

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
game and so we can have it here and then
and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:09.000> Ender<00:01:09.360> scarring<00:01:10.320> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and then there is an Ender scarring on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
and then there is an Ender scarring on
this<00:01:11.369> game<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> end<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.049> 2.5<00:01:13.619> goals<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
this game and the end of 2.5 goals it's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.109 
this game and the end of 2.5 goals it's
for<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:16.290> available<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:17.119> 444

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
for me the best available on 444

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
for me the best available on 444
approach<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> game<00:01:18.750> yeah<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:19.950> I'm

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
approach this game yeah do you know I'm

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
approach this game yeah do you know I'm
with<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> under<00:01:21.960> two

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with you on this one at the under two

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
with you on this one at the under two
and<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> half<00:01:22.409> goals<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> could

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and a half goals and I think we could

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
and a half goals and I think we could
sort<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.840> close<00:01:25.200> match<00:01:25.229> possibly

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
sort of see a very close match possibly

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
sort of see a very close match possibly
one<00:01:26.460> possibly<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.240> girls<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.930> possibly<00:01:28.439> also

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
one possibly two girls and possibly also

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
one possibly two girls and possibly also
not<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:29.159> both<00:01:29.310> sides<00:01:29.700> here<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.750> close

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
not from both sides here a very close

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
not from both sides here a very close
match<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.890> even<00:01:32.100> sort<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> similar<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> what

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
match maybe even sort of similar to what

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.030 
match maybe even sort of similar to what
we<00:01:33.090> saw<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.960> Chelsea<00:01:34.439> played<00:01:34.619> Manchester

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we saw when Chelsea played Manchester

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.910 
we saw when Chelsea played Manchester
United<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.390> during<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.869> bet<00:01:37.020> chat<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.890> I

second best defense at home in the

second best defense at home in the
league<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.369> Chelsea<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> highest<00:01:54.060> on

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.230 
league but Chelsea have the highest on
the<00:01:55.110> road<00:01:55.290> scoring<00:01:55.860> record<00:01:56.250> whilst<00:01:56.880> also

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the road scoring record whilst also

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.959 
the road scoring record whilst also
being<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.990> strong<00:01:58.350> defense<00:01:58.649> too<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.670> that's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
being in a strong defense too so that's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.899 
being in a strong defense too so that's
why<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> Ender<00:02:01.549> do<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.640> think

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
why I'm going for the Ender do you think

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
why I'm going for the Ender do you think
we're<00:02:03.060> seeing<00:02:03.299> goals<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.659> both<00:02:03.869> sides<00:02:04.200> like

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
we're seeing goals from both sides like

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.830 
we're seeing goals from both sides like
can<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.040> predict<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> winner<00:02:06.110> well<00:02:07.110> no<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
can you predict a winner well no I

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.240 
can you predict a winner well no I
cannot<00:02:09.840> predict<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.319> winner<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.679> understand<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
cannot predict a winner I understand the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.450 
cannot predict a winner I understand the
the<00:02:12.430> point<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.760> your<00:02:13.000> off<00:02:13.390> Alex<00:02:13.870> here<00:02:14.460> both

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
the point of your off Alex here both

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.120 
the point of your off Alex here both
teams<00:02:15.700> with<00:02:15.850> very<00:02:16.630> good<00:02:16.870> offensive<00:02:17.230> lines<00:02:17.650> but

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
teams with very good offensive lines but

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.340 
teams with very good offensive lines but
i<00:02:18.490> think<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.480> approach<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.140> game

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
i think that the approach of the game

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.480 
i think that the approach of the game
well<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.840> lose<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.530> not<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.310> lose<00:02:24.460> it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
well is not to lose it so not to lose it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.180 
well is not to lose it so not to lose it
you<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:26.230> kind<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.560> approach<00:02:26.830> that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
you and that kind of approach that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.140 
you and that kind of approach that
morning<00:02:27.550> gonna<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:29.110> sure<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.590> game

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.180 
morning gonna have for sure in this game
in<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.420> opinion<00:02:31.600> will<00:02:31.840> result<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.890> again

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
in my opinion will result on again

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.030 
in my opinion will result on again
without<00:02:33.370> many<00:02:33.820> goals<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:35.110> I'm<00:02:35.410> with<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.740> with

the ender from its vice the baseline and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.900 
the ender from its vice the baseline and
I<00:02:38.500> also<00:02:39.209> well<00:02:40.209> both<00:02:40.630> teams<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.050> score<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
I also well both teams to score and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.210 
I also well both teams to score and
Cecily<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> i<00:02:43.330> can<00:02:43.870> see<00:02:44.050> well<00:02:44.230> Wanda<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.980> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
Cecily I i can see well Wanda I think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.580 
Cecily I i can see well Wanda I think
that<00:02:45.400> just<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:46.180> Tim<00:02:46.390> thanks<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.410> guy

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that just when Tim thanks for this guy

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
that just when Tim thanks for this guy
so<00:02:48.250> do<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.580> more<00:02:48.760> likely<00:02:48.790> that

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
so do you think it's more likely that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.440 
so do you think it's more likely that
we'll<00:02:49.330> see<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:50.800> or<00:02:50.980> talk<00:02:51.250> two<00:02:51.550> goals<00:02:51.820> say<00:02:52.150> from

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
we'll see one or talk two goals say from

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.130 
we'll see one or talk two goals say from
just<00:02:52.840> one<00:02:53.020> team<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:53.500> opposed<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.980> both<00:02:54.160> teams

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
just one team as opposed to both teams

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.010 
just one team as opposed to both teams
yes<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.410> think<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.280> mark<00:02:57.550> probable<00:02:58.180> it's

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
yes I think that it's mark probable it's

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.920 
yes I think that it's mark probable it's
more<00:02:59.260> proud<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.100> see<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.880> those<00:03:01.150> on<00:03:01.390> one<00:03:01.600> side

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
more proud to see just those on one side

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.610 
more proud to see just those on one side
but<00:03:02.260> well<00:03:03.130> both<00:03:03.610> teams<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.030> whistle<00:03:04.450> song<00:03:04.810> so
