 in the andromeda models that carry the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 letter a and letter j in its nomenclature 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520
 indicate that they have a dispenser

 one 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.630
 it has a valve with a seal that 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.940
 will prevent the entrance of hot air and

 in the freezer compartment of 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.730
 our andromeda models those that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.540
 have the letter h in their nomenclature 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.979
 it will indicate that it has an ice maker

 This consists of an easy mold

 removal and will give rectangular shape to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.450
 trained skies has a line that 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.440
 indicates the maximum filling limit of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.440
 water to freeze 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:25.469
 It also brings a drawer that collects 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.929
 skies unmold two I have the way 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.060
 has a dora release lever that 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.009
 it is rotated and allows the mold to float 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.280
 causing the heavens to come loose and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.619

 door 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.910
 we reverse the process to assemble it
