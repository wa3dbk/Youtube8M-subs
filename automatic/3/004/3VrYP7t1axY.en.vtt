00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it's peeling right off of there you can

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's peeling right off of there you can
do<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.350> two<00:00:49.350> ways<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> either<00:00:50.190> heat<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> up
