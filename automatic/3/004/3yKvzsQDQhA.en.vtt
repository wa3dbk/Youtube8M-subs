okay<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.740> want<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> take<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> little<00:00:08.340> closer<00:00:08.610> look

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
okay I want to take a little closer look

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.120 
okay I want to take a little closer look
at<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:10.280> ignition<00:00:11.280> control

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130

at this ignition control
ofc<00:00:13.640> this<00:00:14.060> is<00:00:14.270> simply<00:00:14.810> a<00:00:15.020> flame<00:00:15.380> safety

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
ofc this is simply a flame safety

Rogers 50:47 which is a fairly common
one<00:00:30.200> for<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.130> time<00:00:31.369> this<00:00:31.520> furnace<00:00:31.880> was<00:00:32.060> made

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.760 

kind<00:00:35.420> of<00:00:35.480> look<00:00:35.660> at<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.840> couple<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.200> things<00:00:36.410> on<00:00:36.739> it

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
kind of look at a couple of things on it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.840 
kind of look at a couple of things on it
okay<00:00:37.579> these<00:00:38.120> are<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.050> hot<00:00:39.530> wires<00:00:39.860> going<00:00:40.670> to

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
okay these are the hot wires going to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.910 
okay these are the hot wires going to
the<00:00:41.420> hot<00:00:41.570> surface<00:00:41.960> igniter<00:00:42.050> there's<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.680> switch

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the hot surface igniter there's a switch

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.970 
the hot surface igniter there's a switch
inside<00:00:43.160> here<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.700> turns<00:00:43.880> these<00:00:44.239> on<00:00:44.740> here<00:00:45.740> we

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
inside here that turns these on here we

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.130 
inside here that turns these on here we
get<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.160> green<00:00:46.370> wire<00:00:46.670> which<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:46.970> grounded<00:00:47.750> to
