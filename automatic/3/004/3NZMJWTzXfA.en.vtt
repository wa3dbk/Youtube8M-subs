00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.690
 so hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.210
 minecraft video and I hope one 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.210
 couple of spells in minecraft vanilla 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 so I am that again 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 whole was with the comments 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.750
 It can be suggested briefly 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.030
 Show and that should be the whole thing 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 also work for a rpg server 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 and therefore also for the multiplayer 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 and so it is also built here can 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.559
 you see that's the whole and me 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.420
 have it in three variations here 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.309
 once built for ice so that's that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 to be frozen against year once 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.339
 For fire it 's just this fire 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 effect as in the intro already 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.760
 seen in front of people and once the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.769
 explode effect that makes people easy 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.900
 so the opponents first simply 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.960
 explode and I can show it for a moment 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.269
 here that with this effect if I have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.650
 now take this wand and there 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.269
 few right click make close to these 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.960
 adversary or bullying 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.850
 then you are frozen so have here 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.689
 this slowing down and he just can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 stop running 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.490
 yes show at the next enchantment 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 simply want to that's just this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 this fire effect and if i am here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 with a wand near one 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 mobs right click then he gets 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670
 just this fire department just burns 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.149
 and and this is also the fire blog 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.359
 set so yes it is just a simple 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.990
 great effect and yes there should be now 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.369
 the same way, yes , yes 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.569
 Of course, whole works well with 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.969
 So many mops not with one 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.979
 companies here, for example, with three 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.140
 keep it up if I'm here 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 apply fire effects 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.899
 We take all pugs in the orbit of five 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.819
 blocks burned and yes exactly 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.630
 if I explode this one here now 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.090
 effect and the user again 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.890
 of course without the crew dying here 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 then we'll see 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 it can explode easily and die 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.680
 do it again with several 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.260
 injured dead just like the whole 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.720
 I'll show you that now 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.250
 the whole thing works with scoreboard 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 objectives for example here with the ice 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.130
 objective with the fire ship or with 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.200
 the export objective and yes the whole 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.000
 is set to one if I here eg 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.750
 So this magic wand pack this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.640
 activate 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.010
 because this objective is just 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.810
 cities mews and then just this pack 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 So it will be measured if I pack this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.630
 use 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 if that is the case is just in the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.739
 now set to one and with 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.630
 this in this command block the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.130
 this bell is connected it will 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.890
 immediately reset to zero and so on 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.330
 I can just because the whole short-term 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.519
 I can be certain at 1 now 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.860
 execute commands by doing so and here to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.430
 for example, execute a place on command 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.170
 or here 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.860
 this particle with execute at the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.970
 run opponents or with me too and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 the same here also with the fire that 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.410
 still the difference that takes place here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.570
 a particle or something or effects it 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.130
 Of course , an exit command is also possible 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.959
 executed with a set block command 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.739
 is that just under this mob of in 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.299
 my five blocks just radios themselves 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.400
 is that just under the one 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.709
 fire blog is set and the same 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 so burn so i can give that 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.680
 the whole just here yes understand if 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.420
 because someone uses a magic wand now 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.070
 has and with all the teams here 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.049
 a man has been added yet 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.420
 he already team is the same ice and there 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.769
 at the front one sees team is equal to fire 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.720
 because you can just on a server 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.940
 Just fire the team or ice or 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.650
 explode barns and then just this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.360
 use each ability and that's exactly what 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.640
 whole with the texture here with the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.560
 magic wand with the wand texture 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.510
 the whole is included in the map 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.489
 So you do not have the texts so 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.870
 now the texture pack is not anymore 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.790
 but is easy at the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.140
 map and if you are in the single 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.230
 you just have to play the player 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.329
 world barns and you can do it all 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.190
 use is right in it and has this 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.470
 magic wand but if the whole on one 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.660
 then you have to install server 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.440
 just these resources file at the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.600
 Of course, the world is what she is all about 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.610
 Show the whole thing needs to work 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.209
 you just in the resorts pack folder 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.100
 pull into 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.610
 and then had this wand too 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.780
 visible exactly if you liked it 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.660
 Of course I want to get involved 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.820
 live and I hope it was 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.590
 helpful and will say thanks for 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.590
 watch and see you next time
