00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
life I was actually able to stick on

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.310 
life I was actually able to stick on
something<00:02:17.280> sure<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.420> fell<00:02:18.720> off<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.080> horse<00:02:19.170> a

don't lose the amount of weight they
would<00:03:35.460> in<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.670> first<00:03:36.000> year<00:03:36.390> as<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.660> would<00:03:36.840> in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
would in the first year as they would in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.790 
would in the first year as they would in
the<00:03:36.960> second<00:03:37.410> year<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:38.430> although<00:03:39.740> well<00:03:40.740> of

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
the second year because although well of

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.430 
the second year because although well of
course<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.250> was<00:03:41.690> people<00:03:42.690> don't<00:03:42.900> usually<00:03:43.080> lose

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
course I was people don't usually lose

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.600 
course I was people don't usually lose
as<00:03:43.680> much<00:03:43.830> weight<00:03:43.890> as<00:03:44.190> they<00:03:44.220> would<00:03:44.460> in<00:03:44.580> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
as much weight as they would in the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.090 
as much weight as they would in the
first<00:03:44.910> year<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.360> believe<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.050> your<00:03:46.860> body

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
first year I believe because your body

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.920 
first year I believe because your body
is<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.310> getting<00:03:47.730> used<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.390> lose<00:03:48.630> weight

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
is just getting used to the lose weight

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.280 
is just getting used to the lose weight
mode<00:03:49.290> burn<00:03:50.130> fat<00:03:50.490> load<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.900> second

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mode burn fat load but in the second

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.150 
mode burn fat load but in the second
year<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.630> body<00:03:54.870> resists<00:03:55.740> more<00:03:55.980> as

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
year or so the body resists more as

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.980 
year or so the body resists more as
there's<00:03:56.400> less<00:03:56.700> weight<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.210> lose<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.840> gets

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
there's less weight to lose and it gets

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.530 
there's less weight to lose and it gets
more<00:03:58.200> comfortable<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.030> sounds<00:04:00.330> kind

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
more comfortable I know it sounds kind

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.910 
more comfortable I know it sounds kind
of<00:04:00.840> up<00:04:01.020> but<00:04:01.170> that's<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.470> how<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.830> is

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
of up but that's just how it is

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.340 
of up but that's just how it is
although<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:03.000> don't<00:04:03.300> vote<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.540> me<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.170> is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
although that don't vote for me this is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.260 
although that don't vote for me this is
just<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:04.950> believe<00:04:05.400> I'm<00:04:05.640> pretty<00:04:05.910> sure<00:04:06.150> it's

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
just what I believe I'm pretty sure it's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.720 
just what I believe I'm pretty sure it's
different<00:04:06.450> for<00:04:06.780> other<00:04:06.870> people<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.730> believe

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
different for other people I believe

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.850 
different for other people I believe
that<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.540> order<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.900> get<00:04:10.170> something<00:04:10.680> you've

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
that in order to get something you've

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.770 
that in order to get something you've
never<00:04:11.070> had<00:04:11.370> before<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:12.330> have<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.660> do

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
never had before you have to do

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.710 
never had before you have to do
something<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.350> never<00:04:13.560> did<00:04:13.800> before

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
something you never did before

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.420 
something you never did before
so<00:04:15.720> even<00:04:16.230> though<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.950> probably<00:04:17.340> a

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so even though this is probably a

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.640 
so even though this is probably a
comparatively<00:04:18.120> small<00:04:18.330> thing<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.109> would<00:04:19.440> like

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
comparatively small thing I would like

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.740 
comparatively small thing I would like
to<00:04:19.980> try<00:04:20.400> apple<00:04:20.790> cider<00:04:20.970> vinegar

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
to try apple cider vinegar

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.200 
to try apple cider vinegar
