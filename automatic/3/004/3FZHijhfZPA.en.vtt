00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:14.040
 the ge power chip fame your passion 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.250
 our challenge the businessman anaílson 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.150
 nunes da silva bought his hilux sw4 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.080
 two months ago she leaves the factory with 171 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.320
 horses 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.660
 he then decided to increase the power and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 He went to the digi power which installed a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 performance kit that drove the engine 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 vehicle for 231 horses 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.590
 he is already a digital customer and there are many 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.719
 years 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.700
 in this time already makes more than ten cars 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.329
 I do not do this 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.039
 I was very pleased with the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.890
 vehicle performance and we're going now 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.860
 to the highway to test this kit 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.100
 performance for hilux where it increases 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.379
 up to 60 horses for the vehicle 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 and who will help us explain how 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.960
 Does this kit really work? 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.750
 to innovate and improve the performance of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 vehicle Claudia, this is for sure it is the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 product developed and manufactured by 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 said power 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.400
 the only one of this model in Brazil and he comes 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 really to bring a benefit one 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.439
 security for the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.689
 owner of hilux sw4 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.200
 at this moment we are walking with the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.420
 the kit is turned off. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 module is off so it is in the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.439
 original form and cláudio exactly this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 is another is another criterion other the Question 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.390
 our kit has differential in the market 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.979
 where you can choose to indicate 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.810
 it means person who walks with the car 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.180
 original no problem 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.850
 beyond the problem now that it is really 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.520
 that the car performs better there 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.159
 so you have to stop the vehicle 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.830
 connects the kit with the car in motion as 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.880
 it works for a kit it can not be 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.880
 connected with moving car 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.020
 are some security measures that 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.950
 You have to be able to turn on the power. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.640
 client then it is customary to turn it on 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 if it is stopped and turned off and now 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.570
 we are going to do a test with sw4 in 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.600
 a climb 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.730
 the car is not running with the kit 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.630
 and we'll go up to see the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.910
 performance 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.910
 come on, come on then. 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.290
 You see the car makes a lot of noise. 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:53.140
 engine is making enough force 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:56.620
 to be able to win the climb 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.069
 It must be about 800 meters the pilot 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.069
 would have 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.470
 The car does not match is Claudia. 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.870
 exactly back strength in him you step on and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.750
 Do you feel that he is using the gait? 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.300
 heavier for power 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.849
 compensate for the car's lack of strength 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.760
 Can I call now, can I have a key? 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.739
 switch on and off and another key 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.630
 selector for you to choose the level of 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.580
 power you want to use let's 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:34.239
 fight now let's always get the kit ready 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.260
 is now connected in three options you 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:43.120
 has three power shielding options 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.239
 24 more performance horses plus 40 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.620
 60 shows more horses Horses 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.049
 to be a girl 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.959
 Let's put it on the show so you go. 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.170
 see that I have two stages to go 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.180
 Ok, we're the girl now, I'll do the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.180
 course to see the result 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:13.900
 can is you need to neither accelerate too much 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.900
 looks at speed performance 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.850
 I'm not stepping on too much because there's leftover 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.590
 corresponds exactly to the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:33.240
 also looks confess national brake 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:37.740
 because you have not even spent half of the hotel 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.990
 with one another with the original car 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.009
 exactly the difference is too big 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.880
 then 60 horses plus 15 pounds of 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.410
 torque 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.530
 So this big difference that you 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.110
 on the rise is precisely by the gain 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.870
 of impressive torque for those who are 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.150
 at home and want a kit of self with the 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:03.479
 phone said the power of the phone 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.720
 paula 0 800 6 0 6 3 332 called revisit 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.160
 We sure have stores scattered around 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.930
 all Brazil 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.479
 and it was these stores we already have 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.000
 countless partners where you can be 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.990
 finding a kit being well attended with 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.990
 satisfaction Guaranteed 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:37.610
 the main thing is to get perform your passion
