look<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> but<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.050> think<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:44.500> looks<00:04:44.530> really

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
look of it but I think it looks really

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.620 
look of it but I think it looks really
cute<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.310> are<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.820> already<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.180> one<00:04:46.360> built

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
cute and are you already have one built

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.180 
cute and are you already have one built
in<00:04:46.870> shorts<00:04:47.200> underneath<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:47.979> don't<00:04:48.130> have

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
in shorts underneath so you don't have

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.940 
in shorts underneath so you don't have
to<00:04:48.340> worry<00:04:48.520> about<00:04:48.669> wearing<00:04:49.510> like<00:04:49.720> spandex<00:04:50.590> or

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
to worry about wearing like spandex or

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.670 
to worry about wearing like spandex or
anything<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:53.020> think<00:04:53.140> this<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.650> a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
anything like that so I think this is a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.830 
anything like that so I think this is a
really<00:04:54.070> cute<00:04:54.310> look<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.940> really<00:04:55.450> depends<00:04:55.780> on

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
really cute look it really depends on

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.450 
really cute look it really depends on
what<00:04:55.900> romper<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.470> what<00:04:56.680> skirt<00:04:56.919> you<00:04:57.100> get<00:04:57.250> like
