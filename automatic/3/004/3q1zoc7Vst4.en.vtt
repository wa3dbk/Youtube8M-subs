now how this works is you're going to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.560 
now how this works is you're going to
take<00:01:04.860> your<00:01:05.070> seed<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> you're<00:01:05.940> going<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
that you can find in a crack so if you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.139 
that you can find in a crack so if you
were<00:01:54.350> trying<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.950> plant<00:01:55.579> these<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.060> a
