00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.470
 the bush 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.100
 which means sablazo in the name of the technique derive part of stoned 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.899
 researcher that the development 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.399
 edwards in the cesar and the English word of the sickle that means 

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.669
 transfer 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.270
 What is the technique 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.700
 The technique allows the identification of specific sequences must perform 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.790
 before sources identify this morning after commented on restriction that 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.250
 contains the sequence 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.410
 This is produced by means of electrophoresis in gentilly hybridization 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.920
 using only his theses 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 The following steps describe below 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 pasadena 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.920
 by ahmed was what it does is the restriction molecules are broken 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.490
 Dénia and are distributed according to their sizes in a data gel 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.800
 past on this paper a nitrocellulose paper membrane is now placed 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 onwards it works like a sponge that thanks to the capillarity 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.550
 on paper clings to an alkaline solution 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.550
 what makes the denia denature 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.659
 and the one that plays the nitrocellulose without a copy of the neal not updated 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.710
 those centers a sealed plastic bag 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.960
 with a solution that contains 2 de dénia radioactively marked 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420
 specific 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 with the henchmen that are looking for 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.049
 the membrane of papers exposed for a prolonged period of time with the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.380
 probes to favor immigration 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.030
 which is a very effective technique for 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.060
 the species will bake specific objectives 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 and holds the X-ray of the nea we're looking for 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.109
 usoz 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.090
 is used to determine the ease with which an individual can contract 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210
 Specific diseases 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.880
 one 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.039
 conclusions we can conclude that this technique is very important because 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.780
 we can detect large gene selections like for example if a person is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.630
 more susceptible than another to acquire sickle cell disease hemophilia the ctm
