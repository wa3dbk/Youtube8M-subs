flowers<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.750> thought<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.110> were<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
flowers and I thought they were going to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.749 
flowers and I thought they were going to
open<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.579> did

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
open up a little bit more but they did

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
open up a little bit more but they did
that's<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.530> little

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that's what they look like just little

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's what they look like just little
orange<00:01:50.220> nuggets<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:51.360> what's<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
orange nuggets now what's going to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
orange nuggets now what's going to
happen<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> they're<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> dry<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
happen is they're going to dry up and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.249 
happen is they're going to dry up and
then<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> form<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.960> stem

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
then it's going to form a little stem

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
then it's going to form a little stem
and<00:01:55.500> push<00:01:55.829> them<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.159> into<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> soil<00:01:56.880> and
