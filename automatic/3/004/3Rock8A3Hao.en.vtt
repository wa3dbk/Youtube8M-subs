00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.040
 that is, the truth I have to say is 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.069
 very very very good 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.129
 It is very soft and apart from recycling 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.150
 what matters is good recyclable 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:12.540
 we have a 3 inch screen this 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.829
 as you can see but here we have a 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.349
 3 inch screen as you can see 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.450
 here this red is a single track for 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.980
 lift the protective purpose that already brings 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 let's advertise paid 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:32.140
 Argentina and now we have the button 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 start the back button and the button 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.160
 menu in the bottom part we have 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.580
 the microphone on the side 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 we made the qwerty keyboard that 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.380
 those are very fanatical keyboards because 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.740
 how am I sending texts month 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.630
 constantly data and be 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.940
 putting the two on the screen does not 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.470
 It is very comfortable but this keyboard 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 it is much more hall 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.600
 here the right side we have 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.850
 volume controller go down 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.700
 button volume to quickly access 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.650
 the 5 megapixel camera possesses 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.200
 at the top we have the button 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.019
 on and the button that the same button 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.250
 It also works to block the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.610
 keyboard the device in the middle we have 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.300
 the mini usb connector 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.990
 and its input 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.840
 of 3.5 handsets or handsets 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.300
 millimeters 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.529
 in the back xperia with the logo 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.129
 very cute corporeal very nice the detail 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.779
 excellent as I said this 5 camera 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.289
 megapixels allows you to record videos in 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.800
 high definition 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.800
 Y 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.150
 It has a giga hertz processor of the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.240
 from a core 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.600
 Well, the Android 2.3 operating system 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.700
 gingerbread that for this kind of 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.290
 devices is more than versatile because 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.000
 It's very light and the phone itself 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.000
 works works very well 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.160
 good new things that I have to call 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.300
 a lot of attention of are and directions 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.990
 they are and direction is always 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.990
 used 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.780
 to give us to show us packagings vista 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:35.470
 where the charger came with its little bag 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.440
 the cable then came with his bag 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.210
 in free hands he came with his so is 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.610
 everything always came with his appointments 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.880
 well this is not the only thing that brings 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.270
 the bag is this 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.400
 is the battery that does not last long is astro 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.800
 can check in any forum in 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.570
 My fellow people anywhere 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.040
 that they also have this same 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.100
 equipment does not last the battery 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.220
 Regrettably 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.520
 always take tablet options for 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.240
 load it in by usb or buy another 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.610
 Unfortunately, there is no other battery 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.340
 shape 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.770
 what I was telling you is that this does not bring us 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.330
 to these two dates because they are just 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.669
 and directions are leaving to use to 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.020
 these sachets these sachets and is 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:27.590
 recyclable but still they opt for 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.979
 save your your new equipment in this 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.469
 in this bag of recyclable material 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.719
 that does not open them up to be exactly that 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.910
 it's because I do not know it does not specify it in 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.040
 nowhere 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.230
 but hey this is all for the middle 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.230
 environment and we support 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.849
 I do not know how, leaving aside the 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.639
 nylon all for 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.530
 thinking a bit about the environment is 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.259
 pretty good sony ericsson is 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.990
 making his move with the xperia 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.360
 mini pro and with other cell phones of the 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.780
 same range 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.990
 well this is all for now the next 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:12.550
 video is going to see let's give the team 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.740
 in operation as it performs as 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.610
 responds to the 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.380
 to our requirements and well that's 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.289
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.289
 we'll see in the next and think of droid
