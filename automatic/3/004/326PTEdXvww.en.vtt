F<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.230> i'm<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.470> sure<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.039> always<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.460> did

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
F to do it i'm not sure we always we did

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
F to do it i'm not sure we always we did
it<00:00:26.730> earlier<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.090> i<00:00:27.510> already<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.380> this

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it earlier so i already have this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it's probably will take awhile to do as

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's probably will take awhile to do as
it<00:00:35.760> always<00:00:35.910> does

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
it always does

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.090 
it always does
what<00:00:38.110> always<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.470> meant<00:00:38.680> not<00:00:38.830> sure<00:00:38.950> whether

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
what always just meant not sure whether

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.250 
what always just meant not sure whether
who<00:00:39.220> do<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.490> you<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:40.840> sure<00:00:40.990> whether<00:00:41.170> it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
who do to you not sure whether it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.140 
who do to you not sure whether it
depends<00:00:42.220> on<00:00:42.250> how<00:00:42.370> much<00:00:42.490> memory<00:00:42.670> have<00:00:42.970> or

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
depends on how much memory have or

depends on how much memory have or
anything

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.840

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.210 

right<00:01:13.420> you'll<00:01:14.380> start<00:01:14.620> replacing<00:01:14.860> all<00:01:15.040> this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
right you'll start replacing all this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.440 
right you'll start replacing all this
which<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.730> like<00:01:15.760> half<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.420> half<00:01:17.700> grass<00:01:18.700> and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
then you're starting to crater and I'll

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.980 
then you're starting to crater and I'll
be<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.190> filtering<00:01:21.520> here<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.720> middle<00:01:22.870> of
