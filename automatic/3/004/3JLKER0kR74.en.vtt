00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
original price was 399 so if the sales

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.700 
original price was 399 so if the sales
over<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> full<00:00:27.510> price<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:28.500> again

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
did include batteries with remote - so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.390 
did include batteries with remote - so
that's<00:03:10.670> good<00:03:10.970> then<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.750> was<00:03:11.870> happy<00:03:12.050> for<00:03:13.990> to<00:03:14.990> me

okay and as far as the back I'll show
you<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.560> ports<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.010> stuff<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.460> just<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> second

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
you the ports and stuff in just a second

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.740 
you the ports and stuff in just a second
here<00:03:32.330> okay<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:36.410> looks<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.600> don't<00:03:38.600> know<00:03:38.660> if

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
here okay it looks like I don't know if

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
USB port we got two HDMI ports we got a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.950 
USB port we got two HDMI ports we got a
VGA<00:03:46.720> plug

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
VGA plug

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.620 
VGA plug
we've<00:03:48.350> got<00:03:48.650> components<00:03:49.580> we<00:03:49.790> got<00:03:49.970> audio/video

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
we've got components we got audio/video

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.900 
we've got components we got audio/video
cable<00:03:51.050> and<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.950> audio<00:03:52.340> left<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.760> right

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
cable and then the audio left and right

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.590 
cable and then the audio left and right
we've<00:03:53.570> got<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.200> head<00:03:54.830> oh<00:03:54.980> no<00:03:55.340> that's<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
we've got the head oh no that's the the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.680 
we've got the head oh no that's the the
cable<00:03:57.590> wire<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.280> then<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.700> headphone<00:03:59.090> jack<00:03:59.450> as

cable wire and then a headphone jack as

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.080 
cable wire and then a headphone jack as
well<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:01.040> looks<00:04:01.280> like<00:04:01.370> all<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> ports

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
well and that looks like all the ports

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.880 
well and that looks like all the ports
on<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:02.330> I<00:04:03.020> don't<00:04:03.230> believe<00:04:03.560> there's<00:04:03.709> anything

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
on it I don't believe there's anything

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.880 
on it I don't believe there's anything
on<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.130> sides<00:04:05.350> check<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.470> other<00:04:06.620> side

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
on the sides check the other side

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.080 
on the sides check the other side
oh<00:04:07.100> yes<00:04:07.730> we<00:04:07.910> got<00:04:08.470> buttons<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.709> side<00:04:10.090> start

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
oh yes we got buttons on the side start

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.570 
oh yes we got buttons on the side start
from<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.300> bottom<00:04:11.420> up<00:04:11.660> power<00:04:12.020> source<00:04:12.739> menu

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
from the bottom up power source menu

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.340 
from the bottom up power source menu
channel<00:04:14.239> down<00:04:14.360> channel<00:04:14.750> up<00:04:14.870> volume<00:04:15.200> down

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
channel down channel up volume down

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.400 
channel down channel up volume down
volume<00:04:15.410> up<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.600> that's<00:04:17.600> about<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.959> we<00:04:18.169> got<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
volume up and that's about it we got the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.870 
volume up and that's about it we got the
sensor<00:04:18.770> in<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.980> bottom<00:04:19.310> right<00:04:19.520> hand<00:04:19.549> corner

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
sensor in the bottom right hand corner

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.390 
sensor in the bottom right hand corner
so<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:21.410> makes<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.709> difference<00:04:22.010> before<00:04:22.160> you're

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so that makes a difference before you're

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.390 
so that makes a difference before you're
placing<00:04:22.640> it<00:04:22.940> got<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.480> keep<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:23.780> mind<00:04:24.400> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
placing it got to keep that in mind and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.790 
placing it got to keep that in mind and
let's<00:04:25.460> see<00:04:26.300> how<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.630> attaches<00:04:27.230> here<00:04:27.470> this

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
let's see how this attaches here this

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.650 
let's see how this attaches here this
just<00:04:28.070> slides<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.640> or<00:04:28.790> if<00:04:28.880> we<00:04:28.970> got<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.270> do<00:04:29.419> some

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
just slides in or if we got to do some

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.830 
just slides in or if we got to do some
hardware<00:04:30.380> with<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:31.870> okay<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:34.540> just<00:04:35.540> slid

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
hardware with this okay that just slid

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.230 
hardware with this okay that just slid
in<00:04:36.050> oh<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.620> does<00:04:36.830> we<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.340> some<00:04:37.760> rings<00:04:37.940> here

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
in oh it does we have some rings here

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.340 
in oh it does we have some rings here
that<00:04:38.390> we're<00:04:38.480> going<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.900> install<00:04:39.169> on

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
that we're going to have to install on

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.600 
that we're going to have to install on
the<00:04:39.470> bottom<00:04:39.770> I'm<00:04:39.860> not<00:04:39.980> going<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.220> do<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.460> on

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
the bottom I'm not going to do that on

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.090 
the bottom I'm not going to do that on
video<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.210> that's<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:42.230> about<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.530> unboxing

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
video but that's just about the unboxing

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.890 
video but that's just about the unboxing
there<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.640> wonder<00:04:43.970> if<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.270> still<00:04:44.480> spins<00:04:44.780> like

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
there I wonder if it still spins like

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.990 
there I wonder if it still spins like
that<00:04:45.110> when<00:04:45.230> you<00:04:45.320> do<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.610> but<00:04:46.610> that's<00:04:46.850> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
that when you do that but that's the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760 
that when you do that but that's the
unboxing<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.810> review<00:04:48.200> should<00:04:48.260> be<00:04:48.530> up

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
unboxing and the review should be up

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.310 
unboxing and the review should be up
