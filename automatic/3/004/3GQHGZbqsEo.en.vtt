00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
banjo and all that and conquer but they

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.789 
banjo and all that and conquer but they
were<00:03:37.519> actually<00:03:38.180> pretty<00:03:38.359> hardcore<00:03:38.810> games<00:03:39.260> for

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
were actually pretty hardcore games for

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.990 
were actually pretty hardcore games for
that<00:03:39.889> console<00:03:41.049> especially<00:03:42.049> conquer<00:03:42.409> and<00:03:43.000> who

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that console especially conquer and who

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.280 
that console especially conquer and who
can<00:03:44.150> forget<00:03:44.479> Goldeneye<00:03:45.290> which<00:03:46.280> redefined<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
can forget Goldeneye which redefined the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.470

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.810 

yeah<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.320> guess<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.820> was<00:03:58.970> pretty<00:03:59.330> much<00:04:00.820> you

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
yeah so I guess that was pretty much you

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.090 
yeah so I guess that was pretty much you
might<00:04:02.000> say<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.810> rant<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:05.000> new<00:04:05.150> rareware

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
might say a rant on the new rareware

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.760 
might say a rant on the new rareware
