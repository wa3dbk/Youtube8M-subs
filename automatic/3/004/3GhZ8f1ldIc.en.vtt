00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.540
 good friends, we are already very few 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.510
 days of the start of this great event that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 is the football Brazil 2014 and the formula 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.210
 excel dotcom we have decided to do something 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.770
 so they can keep the statistics of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.530
 this event 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.950
 and we already have this book that consists of 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.369
 two of two eyes one is where we are going to 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.250
 record the results of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.980
 each encounter and automatically we're going 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.309
 to do the calculation 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.820
 and we should put the points the position 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.390
 that occupies the team and also in a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 automatic 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.540
 happen here 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.720
 from here on the round of 16 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.440
 the names of the teams that pass to 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.500
 this phase and it will also put us here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 and meetings to be of 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.400
 give 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.160
 then we are going to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.840
 to be here the good record ends 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.829
 phantom show them 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 we have here the phase to carriÃ³ the 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.899
 group phase and then here the phase of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.079
 final payments we go from 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.490
 here will automatically appear the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.510
 meetings that are going to happen with the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.480
 names the teams 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.310
 we have a quarter final semifinals 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.940
 and I find for the third place and the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.940
 Grand finale 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.409
 then we will register here the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.249
 results we are going to put 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.249
 then here 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.540
 if we see when we do the registration of 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.310
 result of a meeting 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.650
 automatically brings us the club in 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.280
 this table is a table contributed by 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.280
 each group 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.229
 let's finish filling this 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.239
 and if we see when we finish filling 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.969
 the results of the group automatically 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.879
 puts us here the position that each 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.080
 one of them and we mark with a background 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.120
 Gray 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.460
 the two teams that pass to the next 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 to the next phase 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.910
 and 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.040
 and it would be a matter of going to register 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.090
 do 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.370
 and only complete 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.430
 if we go here these two teams appear 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.489
 which are the ones that the group they are 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.090
 going to the last 16 and this is 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.900
 automatic 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.840
 something here in the case of from the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.030
 eighth finals if there is part in a 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.870
 encounter gets a normal result 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.110
 here and in these cells we are going to put the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.790
 result of penalties we are going to go 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.020
 I have another book where she 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:23.460
 I have filled it here 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.860
 and let's see that all the 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.100
 results and the calculations that are generated 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.100
 automatically 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.830
 if we see here it also tells us which ones 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.390
 go to the quarterfinals phase and 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.460
 here we have an example of a tie as 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.910
 we said this nothing else nothing is going to 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.130
 give 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.850
 from the round of 16 if there is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.730
 partly in this case there must be a 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.530
 tiebreaker and we put the normal result 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.040
 and here we put the result of the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 criminal 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.820
 let's put here for example if then 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.630
 they put us red 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.770
 these two cells for us to put the 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.370
 result 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.370
 and this one 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.040
 and finally here as we said the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:25.090
 name equine teams from 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:28.090
 the current phase of eighths is becoming 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
 automatic 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.300
 and today is champion to mexico 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.680
 but for example here in the phase of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.150
 eighth we left out to Brazil 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.740
 let's go here 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.440
 if we go here is not Brazil why 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.770
 here 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.949
 I do not qualify 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.300
 I'm going to modify this this result to 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.300
 that they see that fall 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.310
 to appear here in the end states 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.700
 the name of brazil instead of croatia 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.320
 and good as well as how he says he lives 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.320
 here according to the results 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.780
 croatia went to the final then here 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.540
 Brazil should appear if we leave out 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.560
 to croatia from here I will not change this 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.389
 result to put one here 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.750
 we see that what qualifies here are 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.930
 brazil and mexico 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.900
 and we're going to go to the last 16 and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.689
 Here appears Brazil instead of Croatia 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.989
 and as we see 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:40.080
 take the acrobatics to the end then 

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:42.750
 here phrase appears 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.110
 Ivan we made champion better here it appears 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.740
 the name of the champion 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.410
 and here we have a table this is in 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.200
 alphabetical order is in all 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.880
 teams and here we will put what 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.360
 position of what position is left 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.060
 this 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.729
 we have here the same final statistics 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.729
 we have the games won tied 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:13.110
 lost the goals in favor goals in 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:16.379
 against the difference and we have the goals 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.260
 in favor and goals against by exported 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:21.230
 match 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:25.690
 then I'm going to leave them so that 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:28.760
 download the formulas the thread is 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.169
 fully protected and can see can 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.030
 see the formulas 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.050
 if you can serve something 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.509
 Y 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.509
 good if they detect any error 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:49.490
 It would be good if they put us in a 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.039
 Comment what is the error and if applicable 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.639
 if they solve it then also put the 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:59.379
 solution I hope it serves you and that 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.379
 enjoy this world
