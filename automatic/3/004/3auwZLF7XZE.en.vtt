00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.740
 yop everyone i hope you 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.840
 be well 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.970
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.860
 video on the ryad map 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.630
 so this video is for you 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.130
 show how to paralyze it will have 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.320
 several people so there in the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.820
 video in this case will be at 2 so he 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.730
 will have to follow the steps as I go 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.140
 you describe them in the video so for 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.730
 start it would be necessary for you to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.890
 take the quick rival at the same time 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.600
 So me, I advise you to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.520
 make a small count up to 3 and 3 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.570
 you both take after that 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.040
 you once you have taken the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.649
 blow crime she'll forgive it will have to go 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 at the level of the stone 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.510
 then provide the elixir vulture 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.030
 always the same a little accounts and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.859
 you take it at the same time and for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.109
 finish it will have to go get the 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.999
 mastodon so always like a little 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.280
 count down to 3 you hold the 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.739
 action key and you take masto a 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.830
 times the four trumps that I have you 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.409
 cities will be in your possession there he 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.730
 will one of the two players 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.740
 take care of the box to get the du 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.299
 pariser but before bleeding me 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 I advise you to block 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.140
 by by gus so wanted to give a candy 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.030
 he 'll shelter you will block it 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 like that you will really have no worries 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.810
 at the box level you will be she 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.360
 will remain well and truly spawn and she 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 will not move anymore so here is once 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.560
 that you started doing the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.920
 box and you get paralyzed 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.439
 hours the player he will have got will have to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.479
 commit suicide at the same place as me in 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.409
 the video why in the same place as 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.780
 me because it's a little bug of the game that 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.570
 does that when you commit suicide at this 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.979
 place actually the the game do you 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.329
 do not recognize they regard as 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.670
 as dead and missing 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.079
 so all the weapons you have for 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.549
 I go back to the box 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.600
 so there once you're down 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.090
 your 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.619
 teammates bleeds the box a maximum 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.689
 without stopping but they have to 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.790
 resuscitate anyway before you 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.920
 gone proud once you have 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.200
 reappeared it is imperative that you 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 return recover the mas early because you 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 will lose an asset by an asset to 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.459
 every time it is imperative that the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.739
 master remains in your possession 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.060
 so when you are going to commit suicide 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.830
 the first time you will lose the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.209
 it's not a big deal 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.950
 you do not need to retrieve it 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.569
 once you are going to commit suicide 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.400
 a second time there you will lose 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.750
 the mas early so when your 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.700
 colleague will revive you could in 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.069
 permanently recover the mas early it takes 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 always on you the late or three weapons 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.670
 vultures and masto if you have c3 c3 to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.959
 all there is enough money and you 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.489
 respect the conditions of the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 video you will really have no worries 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.650
 for to succeed 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.850
 it is necessary just to be patient 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.319
 persevere and we get there 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.910
 so that's so I'll leave you on 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.130
 this video end I hope it will 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.360
 will be pleased if it is the case do not forget 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.739
 you do not deprive a coward and a little 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.480
 like a little comment and why 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.680
 not a subscription to the study was going there 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.680
 very soon on illegal timber 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.970
 and
