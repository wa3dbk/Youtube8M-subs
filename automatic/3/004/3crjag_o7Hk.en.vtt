00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.760
 Like water 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.900
 Run year: 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.940
 Spring after winter. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.040
 Death cry 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.400
 The distance subsided. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.340
 Only the wind of the night. 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.340
 Having gone through a maze of houses, 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.020
 I look at the sky without words, 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 Admiring the blue light of the stars and the bright moon. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.160
 Among people 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.400
 And gray days 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.100
 All life outside the window 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.360
 And the pain of separation, 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.680
 And the bitterness of torment, 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.240
 And the rain is like wine. 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.720
 I will enter the city nonsense, 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.360
 Not seeing where darkness is, where light is. 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.920
 Around evil 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.320
 eyes are glass 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.480
 But anyway. 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.200
 Show 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.480
 Prove 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.340
 That I will always be myself 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.040
 Do not lose your appearance 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 Becoming a transparent shadow 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.940
 Under rain 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 Sing about that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 What will my star rise 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.660
 Tears dry again 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.220
 And go away doubts 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.980
 Abomination of eternal sins 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.620
 I am in the lines of poetry 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.680
 I'll tell them "goodbye!" 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.260
 I leave everything in the past 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 It will be easier to live 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.800
 Forget the horror of terrible dreams 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.520
 Let death they prophesy 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.240
 In the new life later 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.840
 I will appear a flower 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.760
 Which grows at night 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.520
 I will be very sorry 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.100
 But if you want 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.860
 I'll sing you again in the song 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.580
 How I live and how I love 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.360
 In blind shadow 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 Days go by 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.760
 Not their way forever 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.720
 They do not catch up 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.960
 And here again 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.000
 No longer return 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.020
 Let the flame of the soul tremble 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.740
 Hurry to live life 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.940
 And in that it is time to forget, the value of breathing 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.680
 Show 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.960
 To prove 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 That you yourself will always 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.440
 And do not hide contempt 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.200
 To weakness and sadness 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.280
 Let in the eyes 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.660
 Pain and fear 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080
 Song you dispel darkness 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.500
 Slightly faster year will pass 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.720
 Never regret 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.340
 Abomination of eternal sins 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.640
 I am in the lines of poetry 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.880
 I'll tell them "goodbye!" 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.640
 I leave everything in the past 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.260
 It will be easier to live 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.240
 Forget the horror of terrible dreams 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.940
 Let death they prophesy 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.620
 In the new life later 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.920
 I will appear a flower 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.260
 Which grows at night 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.900
 I will be very sorry 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.540
 But if you want 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.240
 I'll sing you again in the song 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.000
 How I live and how I love 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.340
 On the face let tired 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.020
 And let them not hold legs 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.660
 I will continue my journey 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.480
 Sun light will not sleep 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.960
 On the road, few of us 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.700
 Will be able to take and relax 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.120
 It will be difficult on the way 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.080
 But luck lies ahead 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.580
 Right, it's time for us 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.200
 Still whining wounds 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.940
 Just live, make plans 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460
 And go, oddly enough 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.240
 Then everything is worse 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.820
 It is always more difficult to go up 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.640
 But we live as we can 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.000
 we 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.460
 Abomination of eternal sins 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.740
 I am in the lines of poetry 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.140
 I'll tell them "goodbye!" 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820
 I leave everything in the past 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.320
 It will be easier to live 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 Forget the horror of terrible dreams 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.000
 Let death they prophesy 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.680
 In the new life later 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.220
 I will appear a flower 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.240
 Which grows at night 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.980
 I will be very sorry 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.600
 But if you want 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.300
 I'll sing you again in the song 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.080
 How I live and how I love 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.040
 Like water 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.160
 Run of the year 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.340
 Always in a circle
