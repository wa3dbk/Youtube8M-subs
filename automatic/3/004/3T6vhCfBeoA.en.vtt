00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
right there and you can do four

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.279 
right there and you can do four
different<00:00:18.090> track<00:00:18.690> setups<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.560> there

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
different track setups right there

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.820 
different track setups right there
and<00:00:22.289> that's<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.710> looks<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.580> box

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
and that's what looks like on the box

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
and that's what looks like on the box
four<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:27.050> what<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.109> looks<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> on

four and one is what it looks like on

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
four and one is what it looks like on
the<00:00:28.800> back<00:00:30.890> right<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.969> produced<00:00:33.480> by

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the back right there that's produced by

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
the back right there that's produced by
Spin<00:00:34.200> Master<00:00:34.500> limited<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:38.210> next<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.390> show

Spin Master limited and next I'll show

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.100 
Spin Master limited and next I'll show
you<00:00:39.719> though<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.550> box<00:00:41.550> assembled<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.690> I'll

try<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.860> different<00:00:44.390> nano<00:00:45.390> speed<00:00:45.750> cars<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
try out with different nano speed cars I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.240 
try out with different nano speed cars I
already<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:48.230> here<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.680> is

a nano speed foreign one rally Cup set

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
a nano speed foreign one rally Cup set
now<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> setup<00:00:55.140> B<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:58.910> ABC

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
now this is the setup B there's a ABC

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.280 
now this is the setup B there's a ABC
and<00:01:00.329> D<00:01:00.980> set<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.300> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and D set up that you can do and this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.310 
and D set up that you can do and this
one's<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.680> set<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.519> B<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.960> comes<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
one's just set up B and it comes with a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:19.820 
one's just set up B and it comes with a
small<00:01:10.320> Ford<00:01:11.280> Fiesta

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.390 

right<00:01:20.830> there<00:01:22.590> here's<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.010> front<00:01:24.280> looks

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
right there here's what the front looks

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.440 
right there here's what the front looks
like<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:28.330> what<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.600> top<00:01:28.840> looks<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
like that's what the top looks like and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.020 
like that's what the top looks like and
back<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.960> course<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.630> bottom<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
back of course on the bottom and the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.940 
back of course on the bottom and the
track<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:38.080> kind<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.440> resembles<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:41.290> horns<00:01:41.710> on

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
track it kind of resembles the horns on

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
track it kind of resembles the horns on
a<00:01:41.980> ram<00:01:42.690> but<00:01:43.690> anyhow<00:01:44.140> here's<00:01:44.740> how<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.040> works

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a ram but anyhow here's how it works

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.080 
a ram but anyhow here's how it works
basically<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.790> take<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.180> car<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.850> pull

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
basically you take this car and you pull

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.110 
basically you take this car and you pull
it<00:01:52.180> back<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:55.620> sometimes<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.800> doesn't<00:01:57.190> grab

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
it back and sometimes it doesn't grab

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.660 
it back and sometimes it doesn't grab
this<00:01:58.900> isn't<00:01:59.260> on<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> perfectly<00:02:00.310> flat<00:02:00.520> surface

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
this isn't on a perfectly flat surface

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.640 
this isn't on a perfectly flat surface
it's<00:02:01.420> on<00:02:01.540> carpet<00:02:02.050> or<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.960> try<00:02:05.260> this<00:02:05.320> other

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
it's on carpet or just try this other

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's on carpet or just try this other
side<00:02:08.010> pull<00:02:09.010> it<00:02:09.100> back<00:02:12.840> sometimes<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.080> makes<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
side pull it back sometimes it makes it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.270 
side pull it back sometimes it makes it
over<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.740> loop

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
over the loop

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.410 
over the loop
try<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.180> again<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.550> go<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.060> pops

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
try it again there we go and it pops

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.770 
try it again there we go and it pops
through<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> flags<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.780> now

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
through like that with the flags and now

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
through like that with the flags and now
I'll<00:02:25.989> show<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.340> close-ups<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.820> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.210 

and<00:02:46.980> now<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.190> we're<00:02:48.370> back<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:50.010> didn't<00:02:51.010> show

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and now that we're back I didn't show

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.600 
and now that we're back I didn't show
you<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.120> other<00:02:52.330> cars<00:02:52.690> oh<00:02:53.459> here's<00:02:54.459> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
you the the other cars oh here's the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.610 
you the the other cars oh here's the
other<00:02:54.760> cars<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.709> try<00:02:56.950> out<00:02:58.620> but

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
other cars that I I I can try out but

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.580 
other cars that I I I can try out but
they're<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:01.150> all<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.629> them<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.140> take<00:03:02.410> more

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
they're not all of them they take more

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
they're not all of them they take more
power<00:03:02.970> some<00:03:03.970> take<00:03:04.209> more<00:03:04.480> power<00:03:05.080> than<00:03:05.410> others

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
power some take more power than others
