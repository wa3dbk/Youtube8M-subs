00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 Rodolfo S치enz Valiente taught me a very nice art trick and animation technique to transform into a box. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:26.759
 How can we do, as animators, and transform ourselves into a box? He told me: "Why? 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.570
 do not take a rope, no, you put it around you, you strain it tightly and you try to walk 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.289
 with that? You will see that you will feel as if you were a box, an inanimate object that 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:53.230
 Take life. " All those experiences that Rufo had in his life 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.120
 as a teacher, he captures them in this book, which is "Art and technique of animation". 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.530
 As you can see, it's a big book, right? Luckily in Spanish, everything in Spanish in development! 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.610
 But then we enter what animation is; and that's where the images are, where 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:22.370
 there are the examples. He talks about the framings, the different aspects of the principles 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.260
 of animation. Look at the aspect of the work of the action line, it is something very 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.970
 useful, both in the cartoon, in 2D, in 3D. Very good examples, a synthesis 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.500
 exceptional. I had the pleasure of meeting Rodolfo S치enz 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.110
 Valiente -Rufo, as his friends told him-, at the Anima festival, in C칩rdoba, in Argentina, 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.500
 in the year 2005. And in a day he had the generosity to give me that exercise, the one to transform 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.660
 in a box, and in giving it to me so that I could give it to my students in AnimationGym, in 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.619
 where I teach animation courses Rufo's legacy endures in this wonderful 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.129
 book that is very good. It is great to be able to introduce yourself in this work 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.700
 that covers amount of information in all animation techniques: drawing, stop 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.129
 motion, 3D animation. Look, sometimes he talks to us about the internal structures of the 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.999
 characters for stop motion. It covers aspects that other books do not, such as 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.760
 the script of the animation. To develop an animated short, to develop an idea, 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 a movie, we have to know how to pose the characters, their dialogues, well, Rodolfo 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.120
 S치enz Valiente, in this book, does it. And another thing that I find very interesting 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.829
 It's the economic aspect, is not it? How to charge a project, how to divide the hours, the 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.340
 expenses, everything we have, he explains it very, very well. It has an excellent glossary 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:14.779
 at the end, about animation terms. I, truthfully, I sincerely recommend you 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:20.239
 to be able to access this book, "Art and technique of animation", which is very good, 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.989
 is from Ediciones de la Flor, the same ones that edit Mafalda, do you know the famous character 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.400
 of Quino? Well, the same publisher: Ediciones de la Flor, has this book called 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.249
 "Art and technique of Animation". I recommend them a lot.
