app<00:00:50.879> has<00:00:51.000> been<00:00:51.030> delays<00:00:51.510> maybe<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> exs<00:00:52.440> might

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
app has been delays maybe the exs might

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.779 
app has been delays maybe the exs might
be<00:00:52.710> able<00:00:52.770> today<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.760> just

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
be able today but for now we're just

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
be able today but for now we're just
going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> take<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> first<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
going to take a look at the first of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to take a look at the first of
these<00:00:55.199> squads<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
these squads you can see here it is a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
these squads you can see here it is a
hybrid<00:00:57.120> between<00:00:57.449> Palacio<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> zarate<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
hybrid between Palacio and zarate the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.889 
hybrid between Palacio and zarate the
reason<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.699> chosen<00:00:59.789> these<00:01:00.210> two<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.719> are

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
reason I've chosen these two is they are

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
reason I've chosen these two is they are
the<00:01:01.020> non<00:01:01.379> rare<00:01:01.559> strikers<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> highest

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the non rare strikers with the highest

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
the non rare strikers with the highest
attacker<00:01:03.120> written<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> whole<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.199> footage

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
attacker written on the whole of footage

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
attacker written on the whole of footage
so<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.159> 85<00:01:05.670> pace<00:01:05.970> 84<00:01:06.600> dribbling<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so you can see 85 pace 84 dribbling an

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
so you can see 85 pace 84 dribbling an
82<00:01:07.380> shooting<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.830> Palacio<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> 82<00:01:09.270> pays<00:01:09.450> 83

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
82 shooting for Palacio and 82 pays 83

inspiration one and see whether you want
to<00:03:59.250> pick<00:03:59.400> up<00:03:59.550> these<00:03:59.700> players<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.200> this

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
mix between the Bundesliga and the cydia

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.210 
mix between the Bundesliga and the cydia
the<00:04:03.840> reason<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.230> built<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:04.620> squad<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:04.920> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the reason I built this squad is of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.920 
the reason I built this squad is of
course<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.610> get<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> link<00:04:06.060> between<00:04:06.240> Ramos<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
course to get the link between Ramos and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.690 
course to get the link between Ramos and
I<00:04:07.110> barber<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.890> both<00:04:08.070> link<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.430> nicely

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
I barber they both link up nicely

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.310 
I barber they both link up nicely
together<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.510> they're<00:04:09.690> both<00:04:09.900> Columbia

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
together because they're both Columbia

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
together because they're both Columbia
and<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:10.709> have<00:04:10.830> built<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.160> respective<00:04:11.910> league

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and then have built a respective league

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.640 
and then have built a respective league
on<00:04:12.360> either<00:04:12.480> side<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.050> four<00:04:13.260> triple<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
on either side of the four triple to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.110 
on either side of the four triple to
around<00:04:14.250> both<00:04:14.400> them<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:14.640> do<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:14.820> get<00:04:15.060> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
around both them we do actually get a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.640 
around both them we do actually get a
couple<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.420> nice<00:04:15.570> links<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> loser<00:04:16.140> with

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
couple of nice links to a loser with

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.590 
couple of nice links to a loser with
Barami<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.459> lincoln<00:04:17.910> together<00:04:18.180> nicely<00:04:18.390> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
Barami in lincoln together nicely and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.090 
Barami in lincoln together nicely and
they<00:04:18.660> look<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.930> two<00:04:19.140> very<00:04:19.440> good<00:04:19.530> sense<00:04:20.010> of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
they look like two very good sense of

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.920 
they look like two very good sense of
the<00:04:20.190> fence<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.430> mids<00:04:20.640> inlet<00:04:21.359> both<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.810> same

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the fence of mids inlet both the same

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.540 
the fence of mids inlet both the same
races<00:04:22.260> inlet<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.680> rare<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:22.979> you'll<00:04:23.190> cost<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
races inlet is rare so you'll cost it a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.650 
races inlet is rare so you'll cost it a
little<00:04:23.729> bit<00:04:23.880> more<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> both<00:04:24.419> probably

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
little bit more but the both probably

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.270 
little bit more but the both probably
going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:25.050> reasonably<00:04:25.860> cheap<00:04:25.950> and

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
going to be reasonably cheap and

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.270 
going to be reasonably cheap and
probably<00:04:26.520> around<00:04:26.760> discard

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
probably around discard

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.580 
probably around discard

guy<00:06:22.870> who<00:06:22.930> doesn't<00:06:23.320> look<00:06:23.530> amazing<00:06:23.789> but<00:06:24.789> apart

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
guy who doesn't look amazing but apart

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.060 
guy who doesn't look amazing but apart
from<00:06:25.240> a<00:06:25.390> shootin<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:25.930> is<00:06:26.140> paced<00:06:26.470> most<00:06:26.830> of<00:06:27.010> the

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
from a shootin and is paced most of the

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.250 
from a shootin and is paced most of the
stats<00:06:27.310> are<00:06:27.520> basically<00:06:28.000> 70<00:06:28.450> which<00:06:28.660> isn't<00:06:29.080> too

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
stats are basically 70 which isn't too

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.900 
stats are basically 70 which isn't too
bad<00:06:29.440> so<00:06:29.979> you<00:06:30.039> can<00:06:30.250> probably<00:06:30.460> get<00:06:30.729> away<00:06:30.760> with

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
bad so you can probably get away with

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.810 
bad so you can probably get away with
using<00:06:31.240> this<00:06:31.870> chop<00:06:32.289> choupo-moting<00:06:32.830> guy<00:06:33.460> isn't

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
using this chop choupo-moting guy isn't

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.339 
using this chop choupo-moting guy isn't
particularly<00:06:34.090> amazing<00:06:34.360> as<00:06:34.600> i'll<00:06:34.690> only<00:06:34.900> 78

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
particularly amazing as i'll only 78

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:36.750 
particularly amazing as i'll only 78
pace<00:06:35.590> but<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.830> does<00:06:35.950> have<00:06:36.039> decent<00:06:36.430> dribbling

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
pace but it does have decent dribbling

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.399 
pace but it does have decent dribbling
and<00:06:36.880> shooting<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.659> maybe<00:06:37.870> you<00:06:37.990> will<00:06:38.140> end<00:06:38.289> up

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
and shooting so maybe you will end up

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.779 
and shooting so maybe you will end up
being<00:06:38.470> a<00:06:38.680> nice<00:06:38.860> little<00:06:39.010> numb<00:06:39.250> rare<00:06:39.400> player<00:06:39.610> and

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
being a nice little numb rare player and

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.070 
being a nice little numb rare player and
the<00:06:40.120> goalkeeper<00:06:40.570> if<00:06:40.720> it<00:06:40.840> was

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
the goalkeeper if it was

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.749

for<00:06:41.199> a<00:06:41.229> 65<00:06:41.740> position<00:06:42.129> would<00:06:42.340> probably<00:06:42.639> be<00:06:42.729> a

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 
for a 65 position would probably be a

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.420 
for a 65 position would probably be a
gold<00:06:43.030> as<00:06:43.150> well<00:06:43.270> 81<00:06:43.780> 581<00:06:44.620> reflexes<00:06:45.099> and<00:06:45.220> 80
