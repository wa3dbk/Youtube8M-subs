these<00:01:01.309> are<00:01:01.519> just<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:02.379> very<00:01:03.379> few<00:01:03.500> examples<00:01:04.309> to

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
these are just a very few examples to

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:14.550 
these are just a very few examples to
prove<00:01:05.380> what<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:06.500> trying<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.920> say<00:01:07.300> now<00:01:08.300> Sofia

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
very close to this to the discovery and

interpret<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.050 

and<00:01:55.030> now<00:01:55.300> we<00:01:55.360> have<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:56.370> crash<00:01:57.370> between<00:01:57.730> two

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
and now we have this crash between two

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.640 
and now we have this crash between two

these crowds of remaining of all
missions<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:22.510> means<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.110> was<00:02:23.380> not

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
missions are it means that was not

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.380 
missions are it means that was not
accidental<00:02:26.190> how<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:27.520> know<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.090> truth

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
accidental how can we know this is truth

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.710 
accidental how can we know this is truth
well<00:02:28.720> let's<00:02:29.410> watch<00:02:29.760> let's<00:02:30.760> see<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.240> I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
well let's watch let's see because I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
well let's watch let's see because I
believe<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.620> not<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> be<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.280> last

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
believe this is not going to be the last

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.000 
believe this is not going to be the last
time<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.690> something<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.470> in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
time we see something like that in

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.800 
time we see something like that in
October<00:02:36.990> 2007<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.290> whole<00:02:38.530> mission<00:02:39.810> was

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
October 2007 the whole mission was

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.090 
October 2007 the whole mission was
observed<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.820> very<00:02:43.450> few<00:02:43.780> videos<00:02:44.100> we

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
observed this is just very few videos we

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.730 
observed this is just very few videos we
have<00:02:45.310> presented<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.330> past<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:47.530> we

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
have presented this in the past but we

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.620 
have presented this in the past but we
want<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.040> prove<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.280> will<00:02:48.700> have<00:02:48.880> been<00:02:49.060> were
