00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.599
 jacket would like to say about 

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.610
 cell phone cameras so he has 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.500
 three megapixel camera without autofocus 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.400
 assets ruslan key located 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.389
 on the side of the phone you can and forget the menu 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.490
 that's why all the same, let's do it easier 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.289
 we activate hryvnia 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.039
 here actually hurry so here 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.329
 Heaped percentage can be said and there is 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.439
 lower minimum 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.550
 there you can even call 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.369
 mean answers edit 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.810
 various sizes 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.160
 settings 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.200
 can cause saturation by the way 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.150
 camera hunting and not autofocus myself 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.510
 The phone is generally considered budget 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 there is a lot of white balance on the construction site 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.739
 percentage adjustment from the appointment that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.110
 very rarely happens at all in the phones 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.950
 additionally 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.080
 what is there 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.350
 pressed even 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.400
 in addition where will be stored 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.290
 preview quality 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.160
 clamping is even 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.810
 how can i see us 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.300
 well, it's just canceling the idea is clear, I think 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.160
 reap Egypt information 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.870
 This is such a book in the name of Eliseev 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.710
 sides can be switched 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.119
 plot and they basically I already spent in 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.850
 they don't matter in principle 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.310
 the only night mode is a copy 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.140
 document a little different night 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920
 the mode there we have 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.070
 the shutter speed is slightly increased 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 and in the document more contrast 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.710
 image becomes 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 fashion 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 also an interesting function of arresting such 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.360
 brother and complex position object 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 This when photographed 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.560
 some 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.990
 on the frames went out different exposure 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.860
 quite an interesting thing then photoshop 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.979
 You can make the sale of the hero photos 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.560
 here on our right 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.840
 have spectacular pretty cool 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.690
 quite a lot of them which is very interesting 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.850
 percent 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.100
 here we have the brightness setting 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.860
 interface sense 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.660
 video cameras are basically the same 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.660
 the most interesting thing is that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.740
 I expected the video here to be maximum 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.240
 320 by 240 and nevertheless 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.259
 video here 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.549
 written with a resolution of 640 by 480 and 30 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.799
 frames per second 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.159
 image really 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.959
 cool 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.469
 bitch same mediocre 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.209
 images are cool 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.499
 as you see them 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.649
 Is there an auto? Is it a night mode? 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.969
 Here you can 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:31.999
 to choose 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.179
 effects brightness 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.449
 when shooting video 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.709
 unfortunately not 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.930
 case in court but instead we have 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.439
 adjust brightness 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.949
 This feature is interesting especially 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.679
 when he but you removed the attack 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.189
 cloudy weather or vice versa 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.690
 can 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.230
 and the most powerful attributes 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.799
 edit 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.760
 Manual mode is straight when shooting video 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.540
 edit and brightness 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.350
 especially if the phone can't shutter you 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.370
 or adjust the exposure and for example 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.270
 at 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.759
 his phone for example 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.979
 m 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.799
 in the sun 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.430
 the brightness we have falls photo you can 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.919
 manually reduce it and then we will have 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.159
 came to Kosovo he himself was not and then I 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.869
 not bad 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.869
 as far as such 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.589
 cameras 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.820
 n to repeat that 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.199
 video and that it is really good 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.629
 take pictures 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:30.609
 not bad
