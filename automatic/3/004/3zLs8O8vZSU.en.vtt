00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.709
 the song in which nothing is more common the siri the mackerel with the cod and others 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.490
 who live in the sea the club does not have huge amounts of gametes 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.279
 many games are formed and the amount of puppies is also large 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.970
 however, most of them died before reaching adulthood 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.699
 producing a large number of puppies these species 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 guarantee their maintenance 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.530
 the father and the mother 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.220
 in October there will be transmission I took my son had same roni and is what 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.350
 tells the column ciciliotti I know how it is click here 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.960
 dolphins are marine mammals 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.649
 they were just a chick with gestation medicine 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.380
 gestation takes a year and tomorrow will increase puppy up to a year and a half of 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.060
 age 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.930
 so during this period of breastfeeding the baby dolphin 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.160
 save energy in the search for food in addition to the demand for food 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.600
 would remove from his parents what would be injured since he could be attacked 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 by predators 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390
 it means that the dolphins 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.880
 curiosities like us that same 20 more 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.440
 and other animals 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 and here also says that they have behaviors the sources 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 completely social 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.149
 that's right dolphins have social behaviors 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.330
 I mean they live in a group 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.270
 for example at the time of delivery, the mother moves away from the group along with one 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 another female who goes cajuda tuition and when the dolphin in the sequel took up 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.640
 the surface of the sea 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.050
 he breathe 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.720
 this is the kind of social behavior called parental behavior that brings 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.870
 an enormous number of advantages this behavior refers to the care of the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.970
 parents with the puppies 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.869
 there are many advantages of species producing a single child 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.800
 and takes special care and their descendants 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.480
 as each female generates one suffered acts the parents can take care of it until the stage 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.639
 adult survival 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.669
 like the other marine living creatures the bonfim puppies are also 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.789
 subject to predator action in the case 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.189
 of sharks 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.030
 only as a dolphin father he is always taking care of the cub next to him 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:33.459
 If a shark attack occurs, the father can set his or her cub after 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 stronger and more experienced than his son had been born 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.459
 Jorge, it is easy to conclude that, although there was no parental 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.569
 dolphin population would be much lower 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.169
 in this social behavior of dolphins goes far beyond what you 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.259
 just saw 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.939
 during the period in which he is accompanied by his parents he goes through a 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:53.989
 apprentice 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.409
 where until now nothing 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.900
 to live alone without the help of the more experienced dolphins 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:05.339
 watching the parents the puppy learns to go get food learn how to hunt 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:09.519
 fish and also learn how to flee said defending his coaches 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.759
 and living with his parents and his son, he learned to depend on sharks 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.759
 It's just like us and it's very similar. 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.500
 here also says that living with other puppies the dolphins also 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.490
 they play a lot of things 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.509
 which serve as a workout for adulthood with the play lines 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.579
 it's not easy, it's all right 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.599
 a month ago 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 or else 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.780
 - coffins 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.749
 during those three years 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.699
 because I'm not sad 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.659
 it can not be 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.069
 the parks sector 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.339
 by the brown way and least of all with children 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.949
 that's right 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.529
 if we compare the juvenile mortality rate of the animals that 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.989
 take care of their offspring when animals that do not care for their young will see 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.639
 that the mortality of animals that care for the prolele 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.299
 is much smaller 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.200
 while only 1% of the 500,000 games of the members survived much of the 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.680
 puppies reaches the adult stage but of course it is not all 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.750
 dolphins that survive because they are also subject to parasitism at 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.989
 lack of food for environmental catastrophes 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.440
 besides the dolphins have been fighting in the simpsons and are other examples of 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 animals that take special care of their young 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.129
 the orangutans, for example strain and pups per gestation and it remains 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.129
 four to five years old with the mother already the chimpanzee pups 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.930
 stay up to seven years with the mother when they reach sexual maturity 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.699
 in nature there are countless examples of animals that take care of their 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.699
 animals that do not have these care but what matters in the 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.120
 It is time that you know the different forms of the species within 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.439
 to ensure the survival of your puppies as you will review now 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.189
 so far we do not think we read gamin au vÃ©lo neutralize them 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.999
 you have seen that the juvenile mortality rate is much higher among the species 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.009
 not caring for their descendants 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.460
 in compensation, these species guarantee survival by producing 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.789
 lots of puppies 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.800
 because he saw that the pups of the animals that care for their descendants are 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.569
 difficult things to capture he has a chance of survival is much greater 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.180
 these species generating a small number of offspring 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.610
 but I left now based on the realities all you will find several times 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.490
 those that can help you understand 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.270
 what are the advantages and disadvantages of a species common to 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.159
 myspace tacv and like dolphins until next time
