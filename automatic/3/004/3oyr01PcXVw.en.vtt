00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
brain supposedly organizes information

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
brain supposedly organizes information
creates<00:02:00.810> emotions<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> she<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
creates emotions that she is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
creates emotions that she is
self-awareness<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> mind<00:02:03.299> file<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
self-awareness so a mind file is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
self-awareness so a mind file is
basically<00:02:04.079> enough<00:02:04.500> information<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.640> able

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
basically enough information to be able

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300 
basically enough information to be able
to<00:02:05.939> pass<00:02:06.329> off<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.020> consciousness<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.740> being

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to pass off the consciousness as being

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
to pass off the consciousness as being
like<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> original<00:02:09.060> person<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.539> based<00:02:09.810> off<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
like the original person is based off of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.130 
like the original person is based off of
yeah<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.550> weird

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
yeah this is really weird

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.340 
yeah this is really weird
yeah

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
yeah

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.000 
yeah
I<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.820> next<00:02:15.090> time<00:02:15.210> guys<00:02:16.230> no<00:02:16.980> I

I have to say you next time guys no I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
I have to say you next time guys no I
think<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.610> bizarre<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.600> for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
think it's bizarre I think it's not for

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.610 
think it's bizarre I think it's not for
the<00:02:19.080> person<00:02:19.700> whose<00:02:20.700> whose<00:02:21.150> mind<00:02:21.600> file<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the person whose whose mind file is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
the person whose whose mind file is
being<00:02:22.860> retreated<00:02:23.340> by<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.550> robot<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.240> for

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
being retreated by the robot it's for

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.360 
being retreated by the robot it's for
the<00:02:24.480> other<00:02:24.600> person<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:25.620> benefits<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the other person so what benefits that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220 
the other person so what benefits that
like<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.210> it's<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.480> oh<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.750> want<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.990> hang

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
like then it's like oh you want to hang

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.770 
like then it's like oh you want to hang
out<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:28.560> thought<00:02:28.860> processes<00:02:29.400> no<00:02:29.700> well<00:02:30.450> no

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
out with my thought processes no well no

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
out with my thought processes no well no
there's<00:02:31.260> two<00:02:31.500> ways<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.130> work<00:02:32.310> for

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
there's two ways that it can work for

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.590 
there's two ways that it can work for
the<00:02:32.580> person<00:02:32.940> who's<00:02:33.090> being<00:02:33.240> sort<00:02:33.540> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the person who's being sort of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.800 
the person who's being sort of
replicated<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.830> could<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.570> want

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
replicated one it could be that you want

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.330 
replicated one it could be that you want
it<00:02:36.930> while<00:02:37.080> you're<00:02:37.260> alive<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.770> walk<00:02:37.950> around<00:02:38.220> and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
talking about I know but I'm saying like

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.190 
talking about I know but I'm saying like
so<00:03:17.460> you're<00:03:17.820> saying<00:03:18.120> you're<00:03:18.360> imagining<00:03:19.020> you're

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
so you're saying you're imagining you're

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
so you're saying you're imagining you're
thinking<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.770> wouldn't<00:03:20.040> find<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.460> be<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
thinking you wouldn't find to be a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.910 
thinking you wouldn't find to be a
suitable<00:03:21.000> sort<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.510> replacement<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.350> there

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
suitable sort of replacement but there

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.700 
suitable sort of replacement but there
might<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.160> millions<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.970> people<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.590> maybe<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
might be millions of people for maybe a

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.500 
might be millions of people for maybe a
suitable<00:03:26.250> relationship<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.030> don't<00:03:27.210> think

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
suitable relationship but I don't think

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.150 
suitable relationship but I don't think
that's<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:27.990> part<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> human<00:03:29.040> experience

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that's like part of the human experience

isn't<00:05:05.949> sort<00:05:06.159> of<00:05:06.250> losing<00:05:06.610> your<00:05:06.699> friends<00:05:07.060> when

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
isn't sort of losing your friends when

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.399 
isn't sort of losing your friends when
you<00:05:07.270> move<00:05:07.389> across<00:05:07.569> the<00:05:07.780> world<00:05:07.930> another<00:05:08.169> thing

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
you move across the world another thing

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.659 
you move across the world another thing
that<00:05:08.530> influences<00:05:09.009> how<00:05:09.159> you<00:05:09.220> develop<00:05:09.580> as<00:05:09.639> a

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
that influences how you develop as a

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.010 
that influences how you develop as a
human<00:05:09.729> but<00:05:10.150> we've<00:05:10.270> sort<00:05:10.479> of<00:05:10.569> bridged<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.990> gap

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
human but we've sort of bridged the gap

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.870 
human but we've sort of bridged the gap
with<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.830> mean<00:05:12.220> there's<00:05:12.370> all<00:05:12.460> sorts<00:05:12.789> of

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
with that I mean there's all sorts of

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.339 
with that I mean there's all sorts of
things<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.300> used<00:05:13.599> to<00:05:13.780> be<00:05:13.870> big

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
things that used to be big

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.020 
things that used to be big
transformative<00:05:15.039> experiences<00:05:15.699> that<00:05:15.849> no

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
transformative experiences that no

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.580 
transformative experiences that no
longer<00:05:16.449> really<00:05:16.720> affect<00:05:17.139> you<00:05:17.229> in<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.349> way<00:05:17.470> they

longer really affect you in the way they

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.210 
longer really affect you in the way they
used<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:19.349> maybe<00:05:20.349> you<00:05:20.650> might<00:05:20.770> be<00:05:20.889> right<00:05:21.069> and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
used to maybe you might be right and

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.710 
used to maybe you might be right and
like<00:05:21.669> they're<00:05:21.819> not<00:05:21.940> gonna<00:05:22.030> force<00:05:22.389> you<00:05:22.539> like

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
like they're not gonna force you like

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.990 
like they're not gonna force you like
you<00:05:22.900> have<00:05:23.139> to<00:05:23.440> have<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.620> mind<00:05:23.919> file<00:05:24.370> replicant

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
you have to have a mind file replicant

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.059 
you have to have a mind file replicant
of<00:05:25.150> your<00:05:25.330> dead<00:05:25.630> spouse<00:05:25.990> you<00:05:26.740> certainly<00:05:26.979> do

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
of your dead spouse you certainly do

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.010 
of your dead spouse you certainly do
have<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.250> do<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.460> now<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.849> will<00:05:28.389> also<00:05:28.599> say<00:05:28.810> I

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
have to do that now I will also say I

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.659 
have to do that now I will also say I
think<00:05:29.259> that<00:05:29.469> many<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.070> articles<00:05:30.310> sort<00:05:30.610> of

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
think that many of the articles sort of

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.820 
think that many of the articles sort of
talking<00:05:30.880> about<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.360> think<00:05:32.320> it's<00:05:32.530> something

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
talking about this think it's something

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.800 
talking about this think it's something
other<00:05:33.159> than<00:05:33.340> what<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.699> it<00:05:34.360> doesn't<00:05:34.719> look

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
other than what it is it doesn't look

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.779 
other than what it is it doesn't look
like<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:34.990> particularly<00:05:35.349> advanced<00:05:35.860> AI<00:05:36.039> like<00:05:36.610> she

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
like a particularly advanced AI like she

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.189 
like a particularly advanced AI like she
was<00:05:36.909> reading<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.270> script<00:05:37.570> there<00:05:37.750> I<00:05:37.780> don't<00:05:37.930> think

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
was reading a script there I don't think

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.920 
was reading a script there I don't think
that<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.380> was<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:38.800> was<00:05:39.130> like<00:05:39.930> spontaneous

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
that that was that was like spontaneous

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.670 
that that was that was like spontaneous
it<00:05:41.469> looks<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.880> looks<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.320> needs<00:05:44.500> more

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
it looks it looks that it needs more

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.830 
it looks it looks that it needs more
work<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:45.009> also<00:05:45.159> looks<00:05:45.520> like<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.880> aliens<00:05:46.330> when

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
work it also looks like in aliens when

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.140 
work it also looks like in aliens when
the<00:05:46.990> cyborgs<00:05:47.590> are<00:05:47.770> like<00:05:47.919> almost<00:05:48.340> dead<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:49.000> all

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
the cyborgs are like almost dead and all

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.490 
the cyborgs are like almost dead and all
of<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.270> sudden<00:05:49.509> they're<00:05:49.630> more<00:05:49.750> like<00:05:49.930> plasticy

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
of a sudden they're more like plasticy

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.689 
of a sudden they're more like plasticy
and<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:50.650> have<00:05:50.770> bashment<00:05:51.159> ahead<00:05:51.400> a<00:05:51.430> few<00:05:51.610> more

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
and you have bashment ahead a few more

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.550 
and you have bashment ahead a few more
times<00:05:51.909> I<00:05:52.180> wanted<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.840> bash<00:05:53.110> her<00:05:53.289> in<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.440> head

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
times I wanted to bash her in the head

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.070 
times I wanted to bash her in the head
so<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.949> white<00:05:54.130> goop<00:05:54.400> comes<00:05:54.669> out<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.900> that's

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
so the white goop comes out but that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.809 
so the white goop comes out but that's
maybe<00:05:56.289> just<00:05:56.409> sci-fi<00:05:56.889> effect<00:05:57.190> you<00:05:57.400> will<00:05:57.580> link

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
maybe just sci-fi effect you will link

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.790 
maybe just sci-fi effect you will link
to<00:05:57.969> the<00:05:58.090> video<00:05:58.419> but<00:05:58.900> he<00:05:59.080> talks<00:05:59.319> about<00:05:59.440> how<00:05:59.740> he

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
to the video but he talks about how he

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.249 
to the video but he talks about how he
like<00:06:00.219> eventually<00:06:00.520> wants<00:06:00.969> to<00:06:01.090> put<00:06:01.509> her<00:06:01.690> like<00:06:02.080> on

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
like eventually wants to put her like on

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.620 
like eventually wants to put her like on
the<00:06:02.440> phone<00:06:02.710> or<00:06:03.099> sensors<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:04.120> could<00:06:04.300> put<00:06:04.479> on

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the phone or sensors you could put on

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.600 
the phone or sensors you could put on
your<00:06:04.659> clothes<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.380> stuff<00:06:05.530> like<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:05.860> so<00:06:06.490> then

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
your clothes and stuff like that so then

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.980 
your clothes and stuff like that so then
you<00:06:06.699> have<00:06:06.849> this<00:06:07.000> it's<00:06:07.240> like<00:06:07.419> her<00:06:07.599> where<00:06:07.870> you're

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
you have this it's like her where you're

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.200 
you have this it's like her where you're
talking<00:06:08.229> hey<00:06:08.740> what's<00:06:09.219> going<00:06:09.460> on<00:06:09.550> i<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:10.090> know

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
talking hey what's going on i you know

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.640 
talking hey what's going on i you know
what<00:06:10.270> i<00:06:10.360> mean<00:06:10.389> that's<00:06:10.659> just<00:06:10.780> weird

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
what i mean that's just weird

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.080 
what i mean that's just weird
yeah<00:06:11.770> it<00:06:11.979> eventually<00:06:12.190> it<00:06:12.430> could<00:06:12.550> be<00:06:12.669> in<00:06:12.759> a<00:06:12.849> full

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
yeah it eventually it could be in a full

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.029 
yeah it eventually it could be in a full
body<00:06:13.300> that<00:06:13.630> looks<00:06:13.870> just<00:06:14.080> like<00:06:14.199> a<00:06:14.289> human<00:06:14.650> I

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
body that looks just like a human I

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.709 
body that looks just like a human I
think<00:06:15.490> that<00:06:15.610> we<00:06:15.699> will<00:06:15.789> definitely<00:06:16.419> have<00:06:16.690> that

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
think that we will definitely have that

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:17.999 
think that we will definitely have that
that's<00:06:17.289> why<00:06:17.469> I<00:06:17.500> like<00:06:17.650> talking<00:06:17.770> about<00:06:17.889> this

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 
that's why I like talking about this

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.550 
that's why I like talking about this
stuff<00:06:18.280> because<00:06:18.400> it's<00:06:18.699> gonna<00:06:18.940> happen<00:06:19.409> I<00:06:20.409> think

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
stuff because it's gonna happen I think

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.839 
stuff because it's gonna happen I think
that<00:06:20.860> eventually<00:06:21.280> we<00:06:21.400> will<00:06:21.490> have<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.699> deal

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
that eventually we will have to deal

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.059 
that eventually we will have to deal
with<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.300> its<00:06:22.599> name<00:06:22.840> will<00:06:23.020> not<00:06:23.139> be<00:06:23.319> bina48

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
with it and its name will not be bina48

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.649 
with it and its name will not be bina48
it<00:06:24.430> will<00:06:24.669> be<00:06:24.819> Skynet<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:26.860> get<00:06:27.069> ready<00:06:27.159> for<00:06:27.280> that

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
it will be Skynet so get ready for that

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.529 
it will be Skynet so get ready for that
anyway<00:06:28.659> if<00:06:28.840> you<00:06:29.110> if<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:29.710> disagree<00:06:30.520> with<00:06:30.849> with

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
anyway if you if you disagree with with
