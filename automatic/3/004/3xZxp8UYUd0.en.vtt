00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.520 
other options you can go with that left
back<00:02:59.560> like<00:03:00.250> such<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:00.910> Smeltzer<00:03:01.660> from<00:03:01.959> Borussia

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
back like such as Smeltzer from Borussia

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.370 
back like such as Smeltzer from Borussia
Dortmund<00:03:03.100> but<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.330> went<00:03:04.570> with<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> anson<00:03:05.230> and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
Dortmund but I went with the anson and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.940 
Dortmund but I went with the anson and
said<00:03:05.590> because<00:03:05.950> he's<00:03:06.100> slightly<00:03:06.340> cheaper<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
said because he's slightly cheaper and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.460 
said because he's slightly cheaper and
yeah<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.820> right<00:03:09.970> back<00:03:10.209> we've<00:03:10.420> got<00:03:10.630> young<00:03:11.170> I

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
yeah in it right back we've got young I

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.330 
yeah in it right back we've got young I
think<00:03:11.769> that's<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.250> sight<00:03:12.570> he's<00:03:13.570> ok<00:03:13.900> he's<00:03:14.590> got<00:03:14.769> ok

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
think that's a sight he's ok he's got ok

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.039 
think that's a sight he's ok he's got ok
so<00:03:15.400> that's<00:03:15.700> not<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:15.970> best<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.510> world<00:03:16.600> he's

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
so that's not the best in the world he's

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.410 
so that's not the best in the world he's
not<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.440> set<00:03:18.130> anything<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.820> lot<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.330> he's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
not going to set anything a lot but he's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.949 
not going to set anything a lot but he's
got<00:03:19.600> 78<00:03:20.110> pay<00:03:20.440> 70<00:03:20.950> for<00:03:21.250> defending<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.000> 67

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
got 78 pay 70 for defending and 67

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.270 
got 78 pay 70 for defending and 67
heading<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.470> thought<00:03:23.680> he<00:03:23.860> was<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
heading so I thought he was one of the
