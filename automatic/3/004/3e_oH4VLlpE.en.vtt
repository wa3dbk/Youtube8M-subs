copy<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> let<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.159> all

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
copy and you let go and that's all

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
copy and you let go and that's all
highlighted<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> hold

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
highlighted now and now we use a hold

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.310 
highlighted now and now we use a hold
control<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.890> tip<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.369> copy<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> go

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
control see tip to copy it and when I go

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.219 
control see tip to copy it and when I go
back<00:02:01.530> over<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.390> say<00:02:03.600> control<00:02:03.930> V<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
back over here and we say control V to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.649 
back over here and we say control V to
paste<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> got<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> whole<00:02:06.420> mess<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
paste you see I got a whole mess of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.960 
paste you see I got a whole mess of
information<00:02:07.429> including<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.700> stuff

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
information including all this stuff

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
information including all this stuff
that<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:10.050> previously<00:02:10.770> couldn't<00:02:11.190> copy<00:02:11.489> all

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that I previously couldn't copy all

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
that I previously couldn't copy all
together

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
together

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.090 
together
so<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.400> tip<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.850> used<00:02:14.300> an<00:02:14.540> SI<00:02:14.960> p<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.440> can't

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
so that tip is used an SI p if you can't

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.670 
so that tip is used an SI p if you can't
copy<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.490> very<00:02:16.670> easily<00:02:16.850> use<00:02:17.330> ctrl<00:02:17.750> Y<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.350> then

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
copy it very easily use ctrl Y and then

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.580 
copy it very easily use ctrl Y and then
ctrl-c<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.370> ctrl-v
