doesn't come off

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.160 
doesn't come off
and<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.980> use<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> low<00:02:13.060> heat<00:02:13.830> low<00:02:14.830> temperature<00:02:16.170> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and I use a low heat low temperature you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.740 
and I use a low heat low temperature you
can<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.410> these<00:02:17.530> at<00:02:17.680> michaels<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.400> white<00:02:19.000> gun

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
can get these at michaels the white gun

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.270 
can get these at michaels the white gun
