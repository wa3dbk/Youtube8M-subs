00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
fifty percent of knowledge population so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920 
fifty percent of knowledge population so
a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.730> churches<00:00:24.090> were<00:00:24.240> abandoned<00:00:24.779> and

Viking Age Norway became also a
Christian<00:00:29.550> nation<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> lot<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.279> reformation

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
Christian nation so a lot of reformation

Christian nation so a lot of reformation
Zinna<00:00:32.730> Christianity<00:00:33.360> has<00:00:33.510> led<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
Zinna Christianity has led to that the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
Zinna Christianity has led to that the
mehfil<00:00:35.160> went<00:00:35.969> over<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> building<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> other

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mehfil went over to building the other

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930 
mehfil went over to building the other
type<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> structures<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.910> today

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
type of structures that we know today

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.450 
type of structures that we know today
one<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> churches<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> Norway<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> also<00:00:41.250> on

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
one of the churches in Norway is also on

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.299 
one of the churches in Norway is also on
the<00:00:41.489> UNESCO<00:00:42.059> World<00:00:42.239> Heritage<00:00:42.510> List<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the UNESCO World Heritage List so in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
the UNESCO World Heritage List so in
fact<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> small<00:00:45.030> viking<00:00:45.600> museum

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.520 

so<00:00:55.899> I<00:00:56.170> think<00:00:56.409> at<00:00:57.010> first<00:00:57.250> with<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:58.480> life<00:00:58.659> he<00:00:59.500> is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
so I think at first with the life he is

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.259 
so I think at first with the life he is
a<00:01:01.019> Manchester<00:01:02.019> big<00:01:02.469> quarter<00:01:02.769> for<00:01:03.269> himself

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
a Manchester big quarter for himself

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.340 
a Manchester big quarter for himself
they<00:01:05.199> also<00:01:05.549> invaded<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.970> antis<00:01:07.540> info<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
they also invaded the antis info and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.529 
they also invaded the antis info and
kept<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.280> settlement<00:01:09.729> there<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.060> many<00:01:10.180> years

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
kept the settlement there for many years

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.670 
kept the settlement there for many years
in<00:01:10.810> 70<00:01:11.590> years<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.729> known<00:01:13.000> for<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.680> over

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
in 70 years so is known for that over

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.620 
in 70 years so is known for that over
here<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.460> authorship<00:01:15.939> which<00:01:16.479> was

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
here we have the authorship which was

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.770 
here we have the authorship which was
found<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.110> 1904<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.820> lathe<00:01:19.000> build<00:01:19.330> chip<00:01:19.570> in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
found in 1904 it's a lathe build chip in

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.740 
found in 1904 it's a lathe build chip in
writing<00:01:20.170> edge<00:01:20.350> which<00:01:20.619> entered<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.130> 1066<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
writing edge which entered in 1066 it

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.609 
writing edge which entered in 1066 it
was<00:01:22.840> built<00:01:23.110> about<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.850> 800<00:01:25.420> years<00:01:25.630> so

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
was built about the the 800 years so

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.649 
was built about the the 800 years so
when<00:01:26.920> they<00:01:27.039> found<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.460> ship<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.909> they<00:01:28.450> found

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
when they found the ship and they found

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.779 
when they found the ship and they found
out<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.080> was<00:01:29.110> still<00:01:29.350> able<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.799> sail<00:01:30.190> on<00:01:30.490> Z

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
out that it was still able to sail on Z

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.770 
out that it was still able to sail on Z
so<00:01:31.630> they<00:01:32.200> are<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.459> what<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.179> problem<00:01:34.659> was

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
so they are and what the problem was

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.469 
so they are and what the problem was
that<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.229> maneuver<00:01:36.149> capabilities<00:01:37.149> of<00:01:37.179> the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
that the maneuver capabilities of the

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.899 
that the maneuver capabilities of the
ship<00:01:37.690> wasn't<00:01:38.080> as<00:01:38.440> good<00:01:38.649> as<00:01:38.860> they<00:01:39.429> talk<00:01:39.640> they

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
ship wasn't as good as they talk they

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.550 
ship wasn't as good as they talk they
found<00:01:40.270> out<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.959> things<00:01:41.170> they<00:01:41.229> found

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
found out with the things they found

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.949 
found out with the things they found
like<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.520> will<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.789> very<00:01:42.819> hard<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.509> do<00:01:43.659> it

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
like it will be very hard to do it

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:51.240 
like it will be very hard to do it
so<00:01:44.679> they're<00:01:44.860> not<00:01:45.130> actually<00:01:49.170> 12<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.740> test<00:01:51.009> our

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
so they're not actually 12 to test our

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.029 
so they're not actually 12 to test our
pilot<00:01:51.759> really<00:01:52.119> work<00:01:52.299> inside<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.500> ship<00:01:53.709> or<00:01:53.920> nay

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
pilot really work inside the ship or nay

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.250 
pilot really work inside the ship or nay
found<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.399> was<00:01:54.670> two<00:01:55.630> bodies<00:01:55.990> one

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
found a was two bodies one

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.450 
found a was two bodies one
leg<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.580> one

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
leg and one

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.490 
leg and one
so<00:02:01.150> different<00:02:01.600> believe<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.170> was<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
so different believe that it was the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.320 
so different believe that it was the
mother<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.580> first<00:02:04.450> King<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.690> Norway<00:02:05.220> novel

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
mother of the first King of Norway novel

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.809 
mother of the first King of Norway novel
but<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.510> layer<00:02:07.690> they<00:02:08.020> have<00:02:08.520> assumed<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.610> is

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
but the layer they have assumed that is

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.420 
but the layer they have assumed that is
more<00:02:10.090> likely<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.630> high<00:02:10.959> priestess<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:12.010> American

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
more likely a high priestess in American

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.500 
more likely a high priestess in American
society<00:02:12.640> no<00:02:13.569> favorite<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.410> with<00:02:14.709> you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.350
