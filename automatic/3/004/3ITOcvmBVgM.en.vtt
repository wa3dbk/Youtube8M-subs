glue from getting into there and then
we're<00:00:34.030> going<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.239> need<00:00:34.390> some<00:00:34.750> kind<00:00:34.960> of<00:00:35.140> saw<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
we're going to need some kind of saw to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.099 
we're going to need some kind of saw to
cut<00:00:36.489> out<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.149> center<00:00:37.449> part<00:00:37.659> of<00:00:37.719> this<00:00:37.870> mount

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.079 
cut out the center part of this mount
once<00:00:38.949> we're<00:00:39.249> finished<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.879> could<00:00:40.059> be

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
once we're finished so that could be

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.079 
once we're finished so that could be
something<00:00:40.179> like<00:00:40.539> a<00:00:40.569> jigsaw<00:00:41.139> or<00:00:41.409> a<00:00:41.879> dremel<00:00:42.879> and

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
then if you want to finish it off for

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.020 
then if you want to finish it off for
the<00:00:44.800> night<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.069> could<00:00:45.219> use<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.699> file<00:00:45.999> to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
the night so you could use a file to

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.579 
the night so you could use a file to
make<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.569> look<00:00:46.780> really<00:00:47.109> nice<00:00:47.260> and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
make it look really nice and

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.680

professional<00:00:48.039> when<00:00:48.129> we're<00:00:48.249> finished<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.510> gets

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
professional when we're finished it gets

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.489 
professional when we're finished it gets
started<00:00:49.870> we're<00:00:50.049> going<00:00:50.139> to<00:00:50.199> take<00:00:50.319> a<00:00:50.350> little

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
started we're going to take a little

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.219 
started we're going to take a little
piece<00:00:50.739> of<00:00:50.889> this<00:00:51.010> painters<00:00:51.639> tape<00:00:52.079> place<00:00:53.079> it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
piece of this painters tape place it

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.029 
piece of this painters tape place it
over<00:00:53.350> top<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.679> our<00:00:53.979> nut<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.739> we're<00:00:56.859> going<00:00:56.979> to

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
over top of our nut then we're going to

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.799 
over top of our nut then we're going to
grab<00:00:57.190> our<00:00:57.280> box<00:00:57.609> cutter<00:00:57.909> and<00:00:58.120> just<00:00:58.600> slice

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
grab our box cutter and just slice

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.119 
grab our box cutter and just slice
around<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.199> outside<00:00:59.469> edge<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.769> painters

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
around the outside edge of the painters

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.309 
around the outside edge of the painters
tape<00:01:00.209> so<00:01:01.209> that<00:01:01.239> all<00:01:01.539> we<00:01:01.749> have<00:01:01.869> left<00:01:02.019> when<00:01:02.199> we're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
tape so that all we have left when we're

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.079 
tape so that all we have left when we're
done<00:01:02.409> is<00:01:02.619> a<00:01:02.649> little<00:01:02.769> piece<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.190> tape<00:01:03.489> covering

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
done is a little piece of tape covering

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.710 
done is a little piece of tape covering
the<00:01:04.479> hole<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.170> glue<00:01:06.130> cannot<00:01:06.850> get<00:01:07.360> inside

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
the hole so that glue cannot get inside

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.330 
the hole so that glue cannot get inside
it<00:01:07.900> then<00:01:08.470> we're<00:01:08.740> going<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.890> something<00:01:09.070> very

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it then we're going to something very

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.940 
it then we're going to something very
similar<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.270> two<00:01:10.510> gaps<00:01:10.750> on<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.410> base<00:01:11.650> of

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
similar with the two gaps on the base of

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.630 
similar with the two gaps on the base of
the<00:01:12.310> Mount

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.520 

with<00:01:19.640> all<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:19.940> done<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.570> can<00:01:20.750> place<00:01:20.990> our<00:01:21.170> nut

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
with all that done we can place our nut

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.880 
with all that done we can place our nut
right<00:01:22.220> into<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.700> center<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.030> our<00:01:23.240> mount<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
right into the center of our mount and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.150 
right into the center of our mount and
then<00:01:24.890> we<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.550> grab<00:01:25.670> our<00:01:25.940> glue<00:01:26.180> gun<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.160> just

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
then we can grab our glue gun and just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.360 
then we can grab our glue gun and just
start<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.550> fill<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.330> gap<00:01:29.690> with<00:01:30.290> glue<00:01:33.370> the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
start to fill this gap with glue the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.330 
start to fill this gap with glue the
goal<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.090> fill<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> entire<00:01:35.870> empty<00:01:36.620> ditch

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
goal is to fill the entire empty ditch

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.840 
goal is to fill the entire empty ditch
for<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.850> cut<00:01:38.810> out<00:01:38.960> behind<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.830> GoPro<00:01:40.610> mount

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
for that cut out behind the GoPro mount

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.120 
for that cut out behind the GoPro mount
with<00:01:41.630> glue<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.170> it'll<00:01:42.350> be<00:01:42.440> flush<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:43.010> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
with glue so it'll be flush with the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.590 
with glue so it'll be flush with the
surface<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.700> we're<00:01:43.820> finished<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.330> flush

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
surface when we're finished and flush

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.300 
surface when we're finished and flush
with<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.930> bolt<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.350> bolt<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.770> surprisingly

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
with the bolt the bolt is surprisingly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.150 
with the bolt the bolt is surprisingly
just<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.690> right<00:01:47.840> size<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.890> same

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
just about the right size of the same

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.810 
just about the right size of the same
depth<00:01:49.820> as<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.750> cutout<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.640> have

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
depth as the cutout is we now just have

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.360 
depth as the cutout is we now just have
to<00:01:52.940> wait<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.300> hot<00:01:53.450> glue<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.750> cool<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.680> our

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
to wait for the hot glue to cool and our

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.670
