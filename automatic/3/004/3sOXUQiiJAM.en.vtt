okay<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> I'll<00:02:45.940> redo<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.150> shot<00:02:47.420> after<00:02:47.990> the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
okay so I'll redo this shot after the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.430 
okay so I'll redo this shot after the
product<00:02:49.490> lizard-skin<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.240> applied<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.870> then

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
product lizard-skin is applied and then

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440 
product lizard-skin is applied and then
we'll<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:52.340> or<00:02:52.670> hopefully<00:02:53.180> it'll<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
we'll see or hopefully it'll be a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:03.360 
we'll see or hopefully it'll be a
difference

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.070 

this<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.760> post<00:03:05.120> application<00:03:05.930> of

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
this is the post application of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.670 
this is the post application of
lizard-skin

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
lizard-skin

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.820 
lizard-skin
both<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.790> sound<00:03:08.420> control<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.620> heat

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
both the sound control and the heat

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.350 
both the sound control and the heat
barrier<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:12.740> applied<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.090> various

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
barrier I have applied it to the various

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.750 
barrier I have applied it to the various
places<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.960> showed<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.530> previous<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
places I showed on the previous on the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.110 
places I showed on the previous on the
video<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.950> now<00:03:19.100> I'm<00:03:19.280> going<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.670> test<00:03:19.910> it

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
video and so now I'm going to test it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.870 
video and so now I'm going to test it
and<00:03:20.500> well<00:03:21.500> actually<00:03:21.860> right<00:03:22.220> now<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:22.459> can<00:03:22.670> tell

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and well actually right now you can tell

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.420 
and well actually right now you can tell
that<00:03:23.510> there's<00:03:23.810> no<00:03:23.959> reverb<00:03:24.590> as<00:03:24.770> there<00:03:25.280> was

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
that there's no reverb as there was

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.910 
that there's no reverb as there was
prior<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.180> applying<00:03:26.450> lizard-skin<00:03:27.080> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
prior to applying lizard-skin it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.900 
prior to applying lizard-skin it
definitely<00:03:28.520> sounds<00:03:29.030> more<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:31.190> sound<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.700> more

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
definitely sounds more the sound is more

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.570 
definitely sounds more the sound is more
deafened<00:03:32.420> or<00:03:32.630> or<00:03:32.840> dampened<00:03:33.410> now<00:03:34.220> I'm<00:03:34.370> going<00:03:34.520> to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
deafened or or dampened now I'm going to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.190 
deafened or or dampened now I'm going to
wrap<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.940> those<00:03:35.120> various<00:03:35.420> places<00:03:35.630> as<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.050> did

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
wrap on those various places as I did

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.440 
wrap on those various places as I did
before<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.770> we'll<00:03:37.550> see<00:03:37.790> what<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> difference

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
before and we'll see what the difference

00:03:38.450 --> 00:04:30.590 
before and we'll see what the difference
is
