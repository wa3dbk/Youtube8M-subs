hello this is mullerian and this is the

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.400 
hello this is mullerian and this is the
ark<00:00:02.639> tactical<00:00:03.179> team<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.689> today<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.900 
ark tactical team and today I'm going to
be<00:00:04.470> dealing<00:00:04.680> with<00:00:04.920> another<00:00:05.490> thing<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.819> has

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
be dealing with another thing that has

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.480 
be dealing with another thing that has
to<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.690> watchtower<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.340> last

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to do with the watchtower so the last

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
to do with the watchtower so the last
time<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.849> talked<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> watchtower<00:00:09.870> we

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
time we talked with the watchtower we

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
time we talked with the watchtower we
were<00:00:10.260> doing<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> watchtower<00:00:11.040> blitz<00:00:11.370> we're

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
were doing the watchtower blitz we're

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.509 
were doing the watchtower blitz we're
basically<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.750> idea<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.370> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
basically the idea is that you have this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.490 
basically the idea is that you have this
big<00:00:14.790> unit<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.980> does<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> swift<00:00:17.430> reform<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
big unit here it does a swift reform and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
big unit here it does a swift reform and
basically<00:00:19.500> goes<00:00:19.740> long<00:00:20.039> wise<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.699> then<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
basically goes long wise and then the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.849 
basically goes long wise and then the
way<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.810> works<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.560> go<00:00:22.650> eight

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
way that works because you can go eight

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.990 
way that works because you can go eight
up<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.180> still<00:00:24.359> move<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
up here you can still move for that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
up here you can still move for that
directly<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.119> mean<00:00:27.359> unless<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.140> zero

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
directly I mean unless that this is zero

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
directly I mean unless that this is zero
with<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.789> definitely<00:00:30.029> walk<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> very

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
with you can definitely walk in the very

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.400 
with you can definitely walk in the very
first<00:00:31.560> turn<00:00:32.210> however<00:00:33.210> sometimes<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.140> can't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
first turn however sometimes you can't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
first turn however sometimes you can't
just<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:36.030> order<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just do that because in order to do that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
just do that because in order to do that
you<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.829> empty<00:00:38.370> watchtower<00:00:39.300> now

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you have to have an empty watchtower now

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.709 
you have to have an empty watchtower now
if<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.250> empty<00:00:41.460> watchtower<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
if you have an empty watchtower that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
if you have an empty watchtower that
means<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.020> opponent<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
means your opponent if they know that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.700 
means your opponent if they know that
same<00:00:44.579> trick<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.230> have

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
same trick can do it to you so you have

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830 
same trick can do it to you so you have
to<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.190> somebody<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.390> stop<00:00:48.629> them

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to have somebody in there to stop them

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160 
to have somebody in there to stop them
from<00:00:48.989> doing<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> problem<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.960> then

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
from doing that the problem then then

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.459 
from doing that the problem then then
becomes<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.579> unit<00:00:54.090> can't<00:00:54.960> leave<00:00:55.230> on

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
becomes that that unit can't leave on

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
becomes that that unit can't leave on
the<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.590> turn<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> big<00:00:57.239> unit<00:00:57.629> can't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the first turn so this big unit can't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
the first turn so this big unit can't
get<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.379> till<00:00:58.680> turn<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
get there till turn to so they have to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
get there till turn to so they have to
take<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.899> rounds<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.500> combat<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.760> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
take two rounds of combat and right now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
take two rounds of combat and right now
we<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.120> got<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.629> boys<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.379> which

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
we just got some our boys in there which

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.270 
we just got some our boys in there which
apparently<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.760> being<00:01:05.909> attacked<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> Moloch

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
apparently is being attacked by a Moloch

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.219 
apparently is being attacked by a Moloch
what<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.729> won't<00:01:08.970> hold<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> need<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what you know won't hold so you need to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
what you know won't hold so you need to
find<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:11.159> boost<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.610> fast<00:01:12.030> as

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
find a way to get them boost as fast as

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289 
find a way to get them boost as fast as
possible<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.299> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
possible but how do you do it and the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.960 
possible but how do you do it and the
idea<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> oh<00:01:15.960> okay<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.590> situation

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
idea is this oh okay in this situation

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
idea is this oh okay in this situation
we<00:01:17.970> started<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> tower<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.860> our

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we started with the tower we have our

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.710 
we started with the tower we have our
weak<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.729> our<00:01:20.909> boys<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.540> which

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
weak little are our boys in there which

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
weak little are our boys in there which
we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> hope<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.710> survive<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
we're going to hope just survive the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're going to hope just survive the
very<00:01:23.939> first<00:01:24.270> charge<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.110> turned

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
very first charge that they have turned

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.609 
very first charge that they have turned
one<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.720> turn<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.530> you

inches away and the best thing then is
ok<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.420> unit<00:01:45.810> cannot<00:01:46.290> enter<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.009> however

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
ok this unit cannot enter there however
