00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:12.440
 Coney charter is happy This video is a human shuriken 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:17.900
 Also out this document at this stage but is what not released 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:22.789
 Drago's grade is forgotten I'm sorry the top three Sakenken first edition included 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 This is the first person of Kenken Gama 10 ninja etc. 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:33.410
 Gingin buckle is attached to each blade is a form to replace and play as you like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.480
 White Ninja of the blade was not out of the same modeling 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.340
 The material is also the same 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.010
 Only replacement basis to N Jamomo Ninja Toka I can but still the core sell 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.300
 I think that there is no nambo 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.260
 If there is a child ninja core even after quinine Well then 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 52 minutes aligned 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.710
 Well someday I would like to arrange for 5 people 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 Hey, what about only but I feel also likely out with Candy portion of the core 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.500
 This grade is the size of the rotating gimmick 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 The perimeter is similar in size compared to the field risk 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 I feel that with the softening hand I do it because it will come nicely 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.070
 Although white is we have a Some people buckle included 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:22.470
 I want to return the core of the contents of the blade after that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.180
 I tried to attach to Chile sage, but I can play such a fashion like wearing world like fashion 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340
 I will 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.130
 The material was the same 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.830
 It's a shaw 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 It is a peach and a yellow that I aligned with blue red white 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 Now continue the core of the white ninja 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.830
 Though I did not To the introduction intently 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 The semi-transparent sticker illuminates the inside of the LED, and the horizontal unlock button 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:56.360
 Here it's such a mystery Roh switch, but I'm sorry 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.360
 It is an error I am sorry I'm sorry I make a makeover sound by repeatedly hitting 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 dj Huh 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.740
 I'm sorry you pointed out various thank you of the most head 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.220
 here 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:21.720
 This switch is a shame that the body care becomes when loaded 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.720
 Turning the relationship while hanging It is a switch of recognition say I was loaded 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 Recognized as rotation 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 So after loading 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.910
 The switch here is pressed in a row by rotating 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.910
 Mental flowering 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:55.260
 Thank you for pointing out only this part 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:58.730
 At first I had to say that the mystery button It was the button that triggered by the barrage 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.209
 There is a switch for the blade to enter 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.209
 Here 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.580
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.950
 The sound of this one circle is in a state of being unfinished 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.290
 I can hear you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.940
 Next is the red Ninja mechanism is the same as the white ninja 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.940
 The turning peninsula congratulates 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 Great depression sounds 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 Is it empty to taste navigator? 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.180
 It is followed jar N demon 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.180
 Here too the basic mechanism is the same 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.110
 It is followed by the sage comes with your test to know RIKEN of the core 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.880
 It may look and design has written stamp of machinery 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.470
 this part 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.010
 That face part is that of shuriken's face and throwing star who Drago 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.010
 It is Kiba 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:59.860
 There is no change of sound by the blade There is no switch here 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.180
 There is no switch for Reply 4 by rotation here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.050
 Just two 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.909
 There is a place to press 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.909
 There are 2 places switches here 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:28.009
 The prima facie instruction manual I'd hear in a backpack bridge Choi Gara' there is described as wasshoi 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.009
 There is also a case where it is not mistaken but just a mistake 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.780
 There are two buttons pressed simultaneously with the conference 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:14.449
 The sound of the button behind changes by pressing and holding the button 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.949
 When wearing a blade of a shurikenken 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.949
 It will be the head of the shurikenjin 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.670
 It is a blade of the Shurikenman Dragon 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:30.130
 Depending on the be mounted here 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.130
 It will be the head of the Shuriken people æ€’ 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.180
 Yes, the deluxe version of the manual shuriken was 2 button or 3 button specifications 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:49.220
 The Tteyuu items made of the Blue Sky mounting or button 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:54.260
 It will come out in the future if it is a existence like a flame god soul or Gaia memory 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.870
 I am very worried about whether I can replace the battery with products such as Shokugan 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.430
 So engine 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.409
 In the case of Shokugan, the initial snack was not able to replace the battery even in the dead body and notes that were soldered 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.449
 That's why 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:08.439
 I would like you to make it playable for a long time. 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.439
 Thank you for watching 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.289

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.289
 9 minutes
