it's<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.740> good<00:01:43.950> indication<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> cars

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it's a good indication of the cars

bring the car up to speed before he gets

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.339 
bring the car up to speed before he gets
to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.550> corner<00:02:00.000> basically<00:02:00.629> he's<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.200> get

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
to the corner basically he's got to get

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.050 
to the corner basically he's got to get
it<00:02:01.470> going<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.920> fast<00:02:02.129> as<00:02:02.310> he<00:02:02.429> can<00:02:02.610> around<00:02:02.879> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.940 
reading on the last part of the
nice<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.950> from<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.190> radical<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.800> can

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
nice one from the radical and as you can

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
nice one from the radical and as you can
see<00:02:22.980> Duncan<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:24.180> pushed<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.959> limit

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
see Duncan really pushed it to the limit

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190 
see Duncan really pushed it to the limit
if<00:02:25.620> he's<00:02:25.980> got<00:02:26.160> any<00:02:26.489> faster<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.480> car<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:27.810> off

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
if he's got any faster that car was off

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
if he's got any faster that car was off
the<00:02:28.530> track<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.069> rear<00:02:29.250> spoiler<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.300> doing

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the track the rear spoiler really doing

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.380 
the track the rear spoiler really doing
its<00:02:30.690> job<00:02:31.220> astonishing<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.700> radical<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.270> it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
its job astonishing the radical as it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.479 
its job astonishing the radical as it
came<00:02:33.540> round<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.959> bend<00:02:34.200> generated<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
came round that bend generated one and a

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.330 
came round that bend generated one and a
half<00:02:35.520> g<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.780> drivers<00:02:37.170> 10<00:02:37.440> stone<00:02:37.770> it's<00:02:38.160> like

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
half g if you drivers 10 stone it's like

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.970 
half g if you drivers 10 stone it's like
I'm<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.640> 115<00:02:39.480> stone<00:02:39.840> pushing<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.739> the

I'm in some 115 stone pushing on the

I'm in some 115 stone pushing on the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
side of him why can it do that because

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.080 
side of him why can it do that because
it's<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.470> racing<00:02:43.709> car<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.370> number<00:02:44.640> place<00:02:44.850> on

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's a racing car with number place on

it's a racing car with number place on
now<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.170> Porsche<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:47.069> actually<00:02:47.340> has<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> higher

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
now the Porsche it actually has a higher

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
now the Porsche it actually has a higher
top<00:02:48.060> speed<00:02:48.090> than<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.599> radical<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
top speed than the radical but this

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
top speed than the radical but this
remember<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.830> all<00:02:49.920> about<00:02:50.130> controlling<00:02:50.640> the

price<00:03:21.060> let's<00:03:21.989> look<00:03:22.200> at<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.470> two<00:03:22.680> together<00:03:22.920> the
