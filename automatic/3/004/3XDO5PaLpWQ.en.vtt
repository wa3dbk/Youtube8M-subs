00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.540
 very good to all and welcome to me 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 channel and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.910
 maga about 7-5 good friends with you 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 I'll make you order in two parts 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 like the others we lived in a part 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.260
 very basic what is going to be this in which 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
 simply because we will try to have a 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 city ​​that is specialized in a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.700
 framework and that is profitable worth and then 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 another one with the most advanced buildings by 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.540
 so to say and more complete the way in this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 first chapter that I'm going to teach good 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.410
 chapter in this first tutorial what 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 I'm going to teach is the basics 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 the first thing that you have to have in having 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 in account is that you are going to need a lot 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 oil and a lot of mineral so you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.470
 city ​​is going to need it, you have two 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.810
 ways of extracting what is the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.820
 traditional waterfront line without city a 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.640
 all the life that exposing the wells 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 petroleum of these or ore mines 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 It's worth either the mechanically manufactured tail 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 what is this here you can get a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.770
 pipe as done I in this case is worth 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.489
 hiconsa pipe so get hooked there 2 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.230
 good of these degrees 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.240
 have six here these are 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.640
 have your extraction and be so 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.220
 mineral as oil at a time 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 here you see the crude and the mineral that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.460
 be constantly go and wear it 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 directly to the factory through the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.760
 pipe in the factory so good for 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.110
 put it paper very few things seven 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.220
 industrial buildings 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.260
 and 14 commercial buildings 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.990
 once you have them you can put the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.390
 manufactured maracó and the first the first 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.830
 expansion that is the production line 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.620
 that lets us put them without any 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.820
 requirement 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.990
 for example if I want to ask for some 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.450
 cosilla is the assembly of drones 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.729
 generators 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.729
 what he does for you to see him 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.250
 some manufactures drones from 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.840
 processors that I go without need 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 you can buy the processor you can 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.380
 make vale you can see how they are made 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.799
 in another video that I have its territorial 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.600
 about electronics and good says you 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.060
 the drones fly to the boxes to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.220
 become with buying drones for 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.550
 the buyers and turns into said 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.380
 omega ccoo and good subscribers 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.880
 the houses paid to Monaco receive 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.930
 Monaco products through the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.519
 buyers these are through the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.019
 purchase of drones and they become 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.760
 single members with the double benefit 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.470
 but exactly what it means but 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.630
 I imagine that good they give more pasta not in 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.880
 general terms then the drones 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.440
 they are also sent to the levels of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.200
 security of mega towers to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 hangars from hospitals to parks 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.260
 of large fire brigades or districts 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.910
 police stations where they replace the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.190
 public workers I do not know exactly 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.590
 what is it that they will do not deprivation that is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.060
 more efficient in the fire, they will go 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.849
 drones and it will turn it off 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.920
 so it's interesting to have it although a 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.420
 little bit clear if what he says here are 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.099
 a little 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.200
 good here is exporting with ore by 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.140
 I have a hundred left over and then I'm 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.060
 buying processors 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.650
 in the processors I use them for 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.410
 make these drones that are coming out 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.569
 here from time to time it's worth me here 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.000
 you have the pipe simply you get it 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.530
 and a point appears here in a center 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.990
 who has experience and the pipeline to the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.900
 I trace around here to destination I have almost one 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.120
 botched because he did not know that you could not 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 happen that the pipe could not pass through 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.900
 over the road so have it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.239
 in mind when you see that 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 you are going to have a little bit of road or 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.440
 place it well and it is already although it is worth more 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.489
 niggles later not to 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.410
 place it what is the line of 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.959
 drone assembly you have to put 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.300
 this building from here this term 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.960
 mastodon and the expansion that is this in 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.090
 concrete is the 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.680
 the robotic division seems to be 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.870
 call what do you need to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.460
 put drones you have to choose because 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.610
 there are different things that you can put 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.450
 to put the building itself what is going to 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.890
 ask is the manufactured 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.200
 market and that are the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.450
 benefits of 5000's kings now 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.670
 as you see here I have benefits of 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.800
 10,000 now it's worth so I have 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.300
 enough more than necessary and as 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.820
 you see the benefits are industrial 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.740
 residential commercial members or what 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.780
 which is just what I read before for the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.720
 drones theme buyers that 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.550
 benefits of mega bulls 0.1 and 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.230
 reasonable benefits 0 because I think that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.120
 a magnet in the region right now that 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.590
 I believe to simply do the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.800
 tutorial 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.660
 and as you see here the frame changes 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.920
 they go around I imagine that selling I do not know 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.390
 what do they do with the boomerang 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.620
 west but let's want to use it in 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.810
 the whole industry as it spends more 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.360
 residence live the trade and it's what 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.210
 gives you the benefits here is worth other 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.680
 little things that you can put to the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.680
 factory do not make me with the sample 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.800
 is the 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.250
 view of the global market 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.950
 as a visa that received resources in a 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.050
 playful ship and the vtol do not have 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 traffic problems in valley and they are not 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.560
 and they are shocking they do not know what they are 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.150
 refer to that 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.150
 save the cuts of deposits 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.740
 bad and invisible commercial 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.419
 but I'm alone 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.419
 one 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.439
 but let's go the step you need univision 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.740
 a division of commerce in the headquarters of 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.539
 humans 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.990
 in the mastodon piece this instead of 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:37.620
 the robotic headquarters is that has proposed the 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.960
 division of commerce that and then 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.849
 we have the extraction station that is 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.740
 it is here that for this what we 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.400
 asks is an extraction division in the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.199
 field headquarters this is worth and be placed 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.509
 about why surely the easiest 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.000
 is that first place the oil 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.199
 traditional and in the ore mines of 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.910
 All life is worth and when you have 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.190
 enough benefits to get a 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.650
 second expansion or if you want to do it 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.419
 in first to sixth perfect if you want 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.250
 place the subject of the drones then 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.659
 first of robotics and to continue with the 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.009
 that count the benefit if you can 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:12.030
 expands and god supports you places islands the 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.720
 extraction stations are here 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.099
 ok and nothing the extraction tube is 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.919
 they give it once they give you it 's all here 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.139
 so it's nothing this has been the 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.479
 very basic tutorial but good ones 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.210
 minimum tips so you can do it 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.190
 Ok, it's quite sweet, you'll have to go 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.810
 little by little until I made it jce vale 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.419
 but good yo 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.700
 the series that I'm making of play 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.310
 without seven cities of tomorrow I'm going to 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.139
 specialize in this and if you want what 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.669
 you can do is go see chapter a 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.980
 chapter how I'm doing the city 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.900
 until I get to have all this in the 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.060
 normal mode not and have enough 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.350
 benefits that's the idea not so 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.970
 I do not expect you to like it if you have 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.950
 been like this already be light favorites that 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.950
 they help a lot and until the next
