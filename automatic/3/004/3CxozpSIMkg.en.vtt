00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
sometimes especially stressful this bit

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.669

like that that big Holloway and gold is
to<00:02:01.030> your<00:02:01.119> pieces<00:02:01.299> up<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:04.270> these<00:02:04.450> down<00:02:04.689> I'm

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
to your pieces up all these down I'm

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.419 
to your pieces up all these down I'm
tech<00:02:05.170> legs<00:02:05.409> around<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
tech legs around like that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.020 
tech legs around like that
and<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.519> want<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:10.380> take<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.530> treads<00:02:12.030> just

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and you want to take the treads just

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.690 
and you want to take the treads just
like<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.530> rotate<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> hammer<00:02:17.920> fall

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
like that and rotate the hammer fall

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.199 
like that and rotate the hammer fall
that<00:02:18.790> down

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
that down

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.850 
that down
so<00:02:19.989> again<00:02:20.910> fold<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> edge<00:02:22.450> around<00:02:22.769> there's<00:02:23.769> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
so again fold the edge around there's a

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
into jackhammer mode this little

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.550 
into jackhammer mode this little
crippled<00:03:18.160> chain<00:03:18.340> just<00:03:18.549> think<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:20.440> it's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
