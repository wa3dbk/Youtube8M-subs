has<00:01:59.810> reduced<00:02:00.079> damage<00:02:00.229> from<00:02:00.469> melee<00:02:00.619> attacks<00:02:00.920> by

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
has reduced damage from melee attacks by

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.060 
has reduced damage from melee attacks by
18<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:02.090> goes<00:02:02.270> 10<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.659> 20<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:03.680> stacks<00:02:03.890> are

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
18 that goes 10 to 20 and the stacks are

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.469 
18 that goes 10 to 20 and the stacks are
pretty<00:02:04.250> much<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.549> par<00:02:04.610> with<00:02:04.850> string<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.329> years

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
pretty much on par with string of years

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.600 
pretty much on par with string of years
otherwise<00:02:05.719> but<00:02:06.500> also<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.890> get<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:07.280> cool

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
otherwise but also you get this cool

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.749 
otherwise but also you get this cool
thing<00:02:07.820> over<00:02:08.090> here<00:02:08.590> fifty<00:02:09.590> percent<00:02:10.100> chance<00:02:10.429> to

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
thing over here fifty percent chance to

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.120 
thing over here fifty percent chance to
cause

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
cause

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.120 
cause
shock<00:02:11.370> pulse<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:13.080> erupt<00:02:13.350> me<00:02:13.620> enemies<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.070> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
shock pulse to erupt me enemies when you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.980 
shock pulse to erupt me enemies when you
hit<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.000> does<00:02:15.270> work<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.660> every

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
hit them this does work with every

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.420 
hit them this does work with every
single<00:02:16.200> one<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.680> attacks<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.220> shock

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
single one of your attacks the shock

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.790 
single one of your attacks the shock
pulse<00:02:17.670> does<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.150> maybe<00:02:18.390> about<00:02:18.630> 56<00:02:19.290> k<00:02:19.440> damage

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
pulse does like maybe about 56 k damage

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.620 
pulse does like maybe about 56 k damage
I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.970> create<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.510> really

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I think it can create but it's really

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.940 
I think it can create but it's really
hard<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.960> tell<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.260> i<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.740> many

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
hard to tell because i have so many

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.890 
hard to tell because i have so many
attacks<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.520> i<00:02:23.580> play<00:02:23.790> rolling<00:02:24.090> bar<00:02:24.210> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
attacks and i play rolling bar but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.150 
attacks and i play rolling bar but
anyway<00:02:25.260> i<00:02:25.440> think<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
anyway i think this is one of the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 
anyway i think this is one of the
coolest<00:02:26.310> belts<00:02:26.730> ever<00:02:26.940> seen<00:02:27.300> i'm<00:02:27.960> definitely

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
coolest belts ever seen i'm definitely

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.110 
coolest belts ever seen i'm definitely
using<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.830> i<00:02:28.950> dropped<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.400> 50<00:02:29.610> million<00:02:29.940> on

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
using it i dropped like 50 million on

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
using it i dropped like 50 million on
this<00:02:30.270> one<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.570> i<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:31.230> feel<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.440> bad

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this one and i really feel that bad

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.850 
this one and i really feel that bad
about<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:33.170> basically<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.620> really

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
about it basically it's just really

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.590 
about it basically it's just really
awesome<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.520> shock<00:02:35.730> pulse<00:02:35.970> percentage<00:02:36.450> goes

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
awesome the shock pulse percentage goes

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.080 
awesome the shock pulse percentage goes
from<00:02:36.750> 25<00:02:37.230> 25<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.070> 50<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.730> melee<00:02:38.940> damage

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
from 25 25 to 50 and the melee damage

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.330 
from 25 25 to 50 and the melee damage
reductions<00:02:39.600> from<00:02:39.690> 10<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.170> 20<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.070> pretty

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
reductions from 10 to 20 so it's pretty

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.530 
reductions from 10 to 20 so it's pretty
damn<00:02:41.490> good<00:02:41.640> roll<00:02:41.850> that's<00:02:42.000> why<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.210> spent<00:02:42.450> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
damn good roll that's why I spent so

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.920 
damn good roll that's why I spent so
much<00:02:42.660> another<00:02:43.560> thing<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.130> got<00:02:44.820> my<00:02:44.970> new<00:02:45.660> helm

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
much another thing is I got my new helm

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.520 
much another thing is I got my new helm
and<00:02:46.110> ariel's<00:02:46.740> visit<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.900> did<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.380> with

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and ariel's visit so what did I do with

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.130 
and ariel's visit so what did I do with
my<00:02:49.650> old<00:02:49.890> helm<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.310> sold<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> yesterday<00:02:51.210> for<00:02:51.540> 140

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
my old helm I sold it yesterday for 140

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.270 
my old helm I sold it yesterday for 140
million<00:02:52.350> today<00:02:53.540> worth<00:02:54.540> much<00:02:55.140> much<00:02:55.530> much<00:02:55.980> less

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
million today worth much much much less

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.040 
million today worth much much much less
than<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.550> because<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.570> did<00:02:57.690> not<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
than that because it did not have a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.130 
than that because it did not have a
socket<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.640> keep<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.880> mind

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
socket so you have to keep in mind

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.370 
socket so you have to keep in mind
sockets<00:03:01.140> now<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:02.040> ramped<00:03:02.880> way<00:03:03.360> way<00:03:03.960> up<00:03:03.990> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
sockets now just ramped way way up and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.850 
sockets now just ramped way way up and
value<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.130> comes<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.530> comes<00:03:07.770> to

socket so sold on without a socket and
bought<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.220> one<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.550> there's<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.820> is

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
bought this one and there's this is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.850 
bought this one and there's this is
costing<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.330> 80<00:03:24.600> million<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.710> you<00:03:25.800> know

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
costing about 80 million and you know

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.830 
costing about 80 million and you know
this<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.040> pretty<00:03:26.280> cool<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.240> tax<00:03:27.630> fee

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
this is pretty cool it's got the tax fee

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.350 
this is pretty cool it's got the tax fee
and<00:03:28.110> crit<00:03:28.590> that's<00:03:29.430> still<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.060> got<00:03:30.240> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
and crit that's still there it's got the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.480 
and crit that's still there it's got the
high<00:03:30.510> strength<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.740> it's<00:03:31.860> also<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.190> more

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
high strength but it's also got more

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.600 
high strength but it's also got more
more<00:03:33.240> stats<00:03:33.600> than<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> other<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.770> did<00:03:34.950> so

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
more stats than the other one did so

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.760 
more stats than the other one did so
this<00:03:35.730> one<00:03:35.880> came<00:03:36.030> with<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.240> socket<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:37.620> why

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
this one came with a socket that's why

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.690 
this one came with a socket that's why
it<00:03:37.830> was<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.040> expensive<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:40.430> there's<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.490> pretty

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
it was so expensive and there's a pretty

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.340 
it was so expensive and there's a pretty
interesting<00:03:41.880> stat<00:03:42.240> over<00:03:42.390> there<00:03:42.570> sixteen

it's a pretty tricky one it does seem to
add<00:04:10.680> some<00:04:10.920> damage<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.400> it's<00:04:11.550> pretty<00:04:11.670> awesome<00:04:11.880> I

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
add some damage so it's pretty awesome I

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.670 
add some damage so it's pretty awesome I
really<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.050> they<00:04:13.110> did<00:04:13.170> with<00:04:13.290> some

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
really like what they did with some

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.500 
really like what they did with some
legendaries<00:04:14.220> but<00:04:14.459> some<00:04:14.670> others<00:04:14.940> are<00:04:15.120> pretty

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
legendaries but some others are pretty

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.430 
legendaries but some others are pretty
lame<00:04:15.720> so

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
lame so

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.750 
lame so
maybe<00:04:17.680> they<00:04:17.799> went<00:04:17.920> to<00:04:18.040> slice<00:04:18.280> those<00:04:18.430> up<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
maybe they went to slice those up in the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.640 
maybe they went to slice those up in the

from now unfortunately for those of you

from now unfortunately for those of you
that<00:05:31.660> are<00:05:31.780> played<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.200> while<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.530> lot<00:05:32.710> of

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
that are played for a while a lot of

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.390 
that are played for a while a lot of
your<00:05:32.919> gears<00:05:33.160> going<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.520> become<00:05:34.950> much<00:05:35.950> much

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
your gears going to become much much

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.460 
your gears going to become much much
less<00:05:36.700> valuable<00:05:37.210> if<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.660> had<00:05:37.840> like<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.230> mid

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
less valuable if you had like the mid

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.250 
less valuable if you had like the mid
the<00:05:38.710> top<00:05:38.950> end<00:05:39.130> gear<00:05:39.490> prior<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.390> patch<00:05:40.600> so

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
the top end gear prior to the patch so

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.659 
the top end gear prior to the patch so
that's<00:05:41.440> kind<00:05:41.680> of<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.800> big<00:05:41.980> downside<00:05:42.400> for<00:05:42.430> those

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
that's kind of a big downside for those

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.159 
that's kind of a big downside for those
who've<00:05:42.850> been<00:05:42.970> playing<00:05:43.090> but<00:05:43.720> those<00:05:43.840> who<00:05:43.990> want

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
who've been playing but those who want

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.750 
who've been playing but those who want
to<00:05:44.260> pick<00:05:44.710> up<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.950> game<00:05:45.100> again<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.520> want<00:05:45.730> to

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
to pick up the game again and want to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.000 
to pick up the game again and want to
continue<00:05:45.850> playing<00:05:46.270> it's<00:05:47.110> it's<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.620> pretty<00:05:47.830> nice

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
continue playing it's it's a pretty nice

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.159 
continue playing it's it's a pretty nice

experience the items have a lot more

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.240 
experience the items have a lot more
Flair<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:51.490> really<00:05:51.760> really<00:05:52.419> is<00:05:52.570> awesome

Flair and that really really is awesome

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
now when it comes to the Paragon

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.480

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
guys to have an idea about how long it

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.340 
guys to have an idea about how long it
takes<00:06:02.919> to<00:06:03.040> level<00:06:03.370> up<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:03.840> so<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:04.870> got<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.200> level

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
takes to level up and so I got to level

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.610 
takes to level up and so I got to level
7<00:06:05.740> no<00:06:06.640> big<00:06:06.820> deal<00:06:06.970> but<00:06:07.300> what<00:06:07.419> i<00:06:07.480> did<00:06:07.720> was<00:06:07.900> i<00:06:07.960> timed

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
7 no big deal but what i did was i timed

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.520 
7 no big deal but what i did was i timed
a<00:06:08.890> full<00:06:09.160> act<00:06:09.400> 3<00:06:09.700> cleared<00:06:10.030> and<00:06:10.210> i<00:06:10.900> want<00:06:11.230> to<00:06:11.290> fight

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
a full act 3 cleared and i want to fight

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.010 
a full act 3 cleared and i want to fight
how<00:06:11.740> much<00:06:11.890> experience<00:06:12.130> I<00:06:12.790> got<00:06:13.000> so<00:06:13.419> for<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.660> free

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
how much experience I got so for a free

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.909 
how much experience I got so for a free
clear<00:06:14.260> for<00:06:14.470> me<00:06:14.500> was<00:06:15.100> about<00:06:15.820> 50<00:06:16.540> minutes<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:17.050> it

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
clear for me was about 50 minutes and it

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.150 
clear for me was about 50 minutes and it
gave<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.460> little<00:06:18.790> over<00:06:19.180> 25<00:06:19.930> million<00:06:20.320> experience

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
gave a little over 25 million experience

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.650 
gave a little over 25 million experience
now<00:06:21.970> when<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:22.450> comes<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:22.690> parallel<00:06:23.020> knows<00:06:23.169> each

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
now when it comes to parallel knows each

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.870 
now when it comes to parallel knows each
has<00:06:23.960> independent<00:06:24.680> experience<00:06:25.280> requirement

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
has independent experience requirement

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.340 
has independent experience requirement
so<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.330> amount<00:06:26.480> that<00:06:26.570> you<00:06:26.750> need<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:27.140> fully

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
so the amount that you need to fully

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.350 
so the amount that you need to fully
level<00:06:27.650> up<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:28.010> remember<00:06:28.790> exact<00:06:29.030> I<00:06:29.120> think<00:06:29.270> it's

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
level up I remember exact I think it's

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.880 
level up I remember exact I think it's
10<00:06:29.630> billion<00:06:30.020> something<00:06:30.290> like<00:06:30.380> that<00:06:30.560> I<00:06:30.680> don't

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
10 billion something like that I don't

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.920 
10 billion something like that I don't
know<00:06:30.950> whatever<00:06:31.700> it<00:06:31.850> is<00:06:31.910> I<00:06:32.090> did<00:06:32.300> the<00:06:32.390> math<00:06:32.420> just

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
know whatever it is I did the math just

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.440 
know whatever it is I did the math just
roughly<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.680> if<00:06:34.220> I<00:06:34.310> played<00:06:34.520> 14<00:06:35.000> hours<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.360> day

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
roughly and if I played 14 hours a day

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.680 
roughly and if I played 14 hours a day
straight<00:06:36.380> act<00:06:36.740> 3<00:06:37.280> grind<00:06:37.640> all<00:06:37.910> day<00:06:38.270> every<00:06:38.660> day

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
straight act 3 grind all day every day

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.800 
straight act 3 grind all day every day
14<00:06:39.380> hours<00:06:39.770> a<00:06:39.950> day<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:41.390> will<00:06:41.570> take

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
14 hours a day it will take

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.660 
14 hours a day it will take
approximately<00:06:43.060> 30<00:06:44.060> days<00:06:44.480> at<00:06:44.840> that<00:06:45.410> rate<00:06:45.740> to

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
approximately 30 days at that rate to

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.330 
approximately 30 days at that rate to
get<00:06:46.850> paragon<00:06:47.330> level<00:06:47.630> 100<00:06:48.080> I<00:06:48.260> think<00:06:49.130> that's<00:06:49.250> a

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
get paragon level 100 I think that's a

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.160 
get paragon level 100 I think that's a
good<00:06:49.520> spot<00:06:49.730> that's<00:06:50.270> a<00:06:50.360> little<00:06:50.510> bit<00:06:50.750> more<00:06:50.930> than

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
good spot that's a little bit more than

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.810 
good spot that's a little bit more than
it<00:06:51.200> took<00:06:51.440> to<00:06:51.500> get<00:06:52.280> level<00:06:52.910> 99<00:06:53.240> on<00:06:54.160> on<00:06:55.160> Elodie<00:06:55.670> and

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
it took to get level 99 on on Elodie and

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.910 
it took to get level 99 on on Elodie and
Diavolo<00:06:56.240> to<00:06:56.450> and<00:06:56.660> I<00:06:57.290> think<00:06:57.320> that's<00:06:57.680> a<00:06:57.740> pretty

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
Diavolo to and I think that's a pretty

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.690 
Diavolo to and I think that's a pretty
good<00:06:58.160> spot<00:06:58.370> for<00:06:58.430> the<00:06:58.760> hardcore<00:06:59.680> so<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:01.220> don't

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
good spot for the hardcore so I don't

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.920 
good spot for the hardcore so I don't
think<00:07:01.820> I'm<00:07:01.910> going<00:07:02.030> to<00:07:02.090> go<00:07:02.150> through<00:07:02.720> with<00:07:02.870> that

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
think I'm going to go through with that

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.470 
think I'm going to go through with that
you<00:07:03.560> know<00:07:03.710> as<00:07:03.890> a<00:07:03.950> rush<00:07:04.430> but<00:07:04.880> every<00:07:05.180> now<00:07:05.300> and

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
you know as a rush but every now and

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.000 
you know as a rush but every now and
then<00:07:05.630> when<00:07:06.200> I'm<00:07:06.320> going<00:07:06.440> to<00:07:06.500> play<00:07:06.620> some<00:07:06.680> diablo

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
then when I'm going to play some diablo

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.680 
then when I'm going to play some diablo
3<00:07:07.400> i'm<00:07:07.790> just<00:07:08.030> going<00:07:08.150> to<00:07:08.180> feel<00:07:08.360> a<00:07:08.390> little<00:07:08.480> bit

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
3 i'm just going to feel a little bit

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.750 
3 i'm just going to feel a little bit
better<00:07:08.810> about<00:07:08.930> it<00:07:09.170> and<00:07:09.410> i<00:07:10.100> hope<00:07:10.280> you<00:07:10.400> guys<00:07:10.520> feel

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
the same i really think the patch does

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.720 
the same i really think the patch does
the<00:07:13.580> game<00:07:13.730> a<00:07:13.790> lot<00:07:14.090> but<00:07:14.810> it<00:07:15.710> does<00:07:15.950> fall<00:07:16.190> short<00:07:16.520> on

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730 
the game a lot but it does fall short on

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.470 
the game a lot but it does fall short on
some<00:07:17.480> incentives<00:07:18.050> um<00:07:18.230> I<00:07:19.180> really<00:07:20.180> think<00:07:20.300> there

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
some incentives um I really think there

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.730 
some incentives um I really think there
should<00:07:20.630> be<00:07:20.690> some<00:07:20.840> kind<00:07:21.020> of<00:07:21.050> Paragon<00:07:21.440> level

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
should be some kind of Paragon level

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.230 
should be some kind of Paragon level
ladder<00:07:21.950> because<00:07:22.220> that<00:07:22.610> would<00:07:22.790> that<00:07:23.180> would

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
ladder because that would that would

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.940 
ladder because that would that would
really<00:07:23.510> push<00:07:24.020> people<00:07:24.380> to<00:07:24.500> play<00:07:24.650> the<00:07:24.770> game

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950 
really push people to play the game

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.530 
really push people to play the game
people<00:07:25.280> would<00:07:25.430> love<00:07:25.670> that<00:07:26.090> people<00:07:26.270> want

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
people would love that people want

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.380 
people would love that people want
to<00:07:26.630> compete<00:07:27.020> parallel<00:07:27.920> levels<00:07:28.190> that's<00:07:29.060> a<00:07:29.210> long

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
to compete parallel levels that's a long

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.240 
to compete parallel levels that's a long
way<00:07:29.570> from<00:07:29.630> where<00:07:30.230> diablo<00:07:30.470> was<00:07:30.770> two<00:07:31.070> days<00:07:31.220> ago

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250
