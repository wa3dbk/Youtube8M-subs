Maine<00:04:48.310> Stearns<00:04:48.700> an<00:04:49.090> experiment<00:04:50.130> today<00:04:51.130> what

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
Maine Stearns an experiment today what

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.280 
Maine Stearns an experiment today what
in<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.730> past<00:04:51.970> especially<00:04:52.330> teams<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:53.050> black

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
in the past especially teams like black

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.010 
in the past especially teams like black
our<00:04:53.620> first<00:04:53.950> bailout<00:04:54.280> has<00:04:54.520> always<00:04:54.700> been<00:04:55.030> we

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
our first bailout has always been we

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.130 
our first bailout has always been we
need<00:04:56.200> probably<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:57.310> total<00:04:57.520> package<00:04:57.820> water<00:05:00.000> and

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
need probably a total package water and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.590 
need probably a total package water and
actually<00:05:02.460> they<00:05:03.460> did<00:05:03.670> much<00:05:03.880> better<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.450> much

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
actually they did much better and much

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.760 
actually they did much better and much
better<00:05:04.780> for<00:05:05.050> which<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.320> mean<00:05:05.470> they've<00:05:05.590> done<00:05:05.740> a

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
better for which I mean they've done a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.560 
better for which I mean they've done a
lot<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:05.980> stuff<00:05:06.280> roads<00:05:06.490> leading<00:05:06.700> up<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.210> but

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
lot of stuff roads leading up to it but

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.270 
lot of stuff roads leading up to it but
it's<00:05:07.750> not<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.930> capability<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:08.920> athletes

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
it's not the capability of the athletes

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.160 
it's not the capability of the athletes
in<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.580> first<00:05:09.820> without<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.630> terms<00:05:10.840> of<00:05:11.020> like

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
in that first without in terms of like

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.230 
in that first without in terms of like
