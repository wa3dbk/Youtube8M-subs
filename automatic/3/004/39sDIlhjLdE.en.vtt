00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
and I've had a lot of questions about

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.459 
and I've had a lot of questions about
how<00:00:45.570> exactly<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:48.469> metallic

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
how exactly to do the metallic

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
how exactly to do the metallic
candy-coat<00:00:50.280> color<00:00:50.610> scheme<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:54.079> basically

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
candy-coat color scheme so basically

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.750 
candy-coat color scheme so basically
what<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:55.829> done<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:57.360> skipped<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> primer

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
what I've done is I skipped the primer

what I've done is I skipped the primer
and<00:00:59.760> took<00:01:00.210> extra<00:01:00.660> care<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:01.469> sure<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.800> my

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and took extra care to make sure all my

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.850 
and took extra care to make sure all my
pieces<00:01:02.190> were<00:01:02.579> sanded<00:01:03.140> very<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.439> smooth

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
pieces were sanded very very smooth

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
pieces were sanded very very smooth
using<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.880> polishing<00:01:06.780> block<00:01:07.250> which<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.460> close

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
nice metallic and then just clear coated

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.990 
nice metallic and then just clear coated
it<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.820> clear<00:01:30.329> blue<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:31.320> clear<00:01:32.130> red<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.640> clear

it with clear blue or clear red or clear
yellow<00:01:33.299> depending<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.740> color<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
yellow depending on the color of the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.300 
yellow depending on the color of the
piece<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> other<00:01:37.229> parts<00:01:38.840> swords<00:01:39.840> are

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
piece and for the other parts swords are

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.200 
piece and for the other parts swords are
polished<00:01:41.310> aluminum<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.930> armor<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> just

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
polished aluminum and the armor is just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
polished aluminum and the armor is just
aluminum<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.159> isn't<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.610> huge

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
aluminum so there isn't a huge

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
aluminum so there isn't a huge
difference<00:01:51.270> between<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> two<00:01:51.899> colors

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
difference between the two colors

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.139 
difference between the two colors
actually<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:54.619> mean<00:01:55.619> after<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> clear<00:01:56.520> coated<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
actually I mean after I clear coated it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually I mean after I clear coated it
with<00:01:58.100> gloss<00:01:59.100> there's<00:02:00.060> basically<00:02:00.540> no

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
with gloss there's basically no

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.859 
with gloss there's basically no
difference<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.350> can't<00:02:01.560> tell<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.750> aluminum<00:02:03.750> in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
difference I can't tell the aluminum in

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.429 
difference I can't tell the aluminum in
the<00:02:04.020> polished<00:02:04.590> aluminum<00:02:05.070> part<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:07.229> how

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the polished aluminum part so that's how

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.249 
the polished aluminum part so that's how
I<00:02:07.469> did<00:02:07.770> it

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
I did it

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.820 
I did it
and<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:11.150> kind<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.269> simple<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.620> really

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and it's kind of simple but you really

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.570 
and it's kind of simple but you really
have<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.129> know<00:02:15.560> how<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.620> use<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.159> all<00:02:17.310> clouds

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
have to know how to use the all clouds

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.289 
have to know how to use the all clouds
because<00:02:17.909> it's<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.830> an<00:02:19.830> easy<00:02:20.040> paint<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.760> use

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
because it's not an easy paint to use

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.130 
because it's not an easy paint to use
kind<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.349> easy<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.739> make<00:02:22.860> mistakes<00:02:24.140> so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
kind of it's easy to make mistakes so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.130 
kind of it's easy to make mistakes so
just<00:02:25.799> just<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:26.879> cautious<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:27.810> you're<00:02:27.900> doing

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
just just be cautious when you're doing

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.339 
just just be cautious when you're doing
it<00:02:28.290> something<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.049> didn't

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
it something like that and I didn't

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.100 
it something like that and I didn't

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that panel lines wouldn't go with this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.750 
that panel lines wouldn't go with this
metallic<00:02:47.840> color<00:02:48.840> scheme<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.010> that's<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.609> my

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
metallic color scheme and that's just my

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.170 
metallic color scheme and that's just my
opinion

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
opinion

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.490 
opinion
but<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.650> could<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:55.049> didn't

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
but it could have like it just didn't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.199 
but it could have like it just didn't
think<00:02:55.530> flat<00:02:56.459> black<00:02:56.760> looked<00:02:57.120> great<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
think flat black looked great on the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.589 
think flat black looked great on the
metallics<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.659> chose<00:03:00.959> not<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.700> got

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
metallics so I chose not to do it I got

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.890 
metallics so I chose not to do it I got
my<00:03:03.720> decals<00:03:04.379> from<00:03:04.650> Samuel<00:03:05.069> decal<00:03:05.659> and<00:03:06.659> those

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
my decals from Samuel decal and those

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500 
my decals from Samuel decal and those
were<00:03:07.049> real<00:03:07.290> pain<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.620> apply<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:09.239> because

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
were real pain to apply just because

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.330 
were real pain to apply just because
they're<00:03:09.659> so<00:03:09.870> complicated<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:12.290> yeah<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.530> just

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
they're so complicated and yeah I just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.990 
they're so complicated and yeah I just
stopped<00:03:14.579> coated<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:16.099> futures<00:03:17.099> or

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
stopped coated it with futures or

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.879 
stopped coated it with futures or
pledges<00:03:18.690> future<00:03:19.349> which<00:03:19.919> is<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:21.079> floor<00:03:22.079> wax<00:03:22.380> an

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
pledges future which is a floor wax an

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.159 
pledges future which is a floor wax an
acrylic<00:03:23.340> floor<00:03:23.730> wax<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.419> a<00:03:24.599> very<00:03:24.959> high

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
acrylic floor wax that is a very high

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.280 
acrylic floor wax that is a very high
gloss<00:03:25.470> finish<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.720> used<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.079> as<00:03:28.260> a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
gloss finish and I just used that as a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.629 
gloss finish and I just used that as a
top<00:03:28.859> coat<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.290> that's<00:03:31.440> how<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.889> turned<00:03:32.040> out

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
top coat so and that's how it turned out

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.390 
top coat so and that's how it turned out
oh<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.209> want<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.859> show<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.919> guys<00:03:35.069> how<00:03:35.129> to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
oh I don't want to show you guys how to

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.369 
oh I don't want to show you guys how to
do<00:03:38.400> all<00:03:38.549> or<00:03:38.879> mess<00:03:39.780> around<00:03:39.900> with<00:03:40.109> all<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
do all or mess around with all the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.920 
do all or mess around with all the
weapons<00:03:40.769> because<00:03:41.269> Vegeta<00:03:42.269> did<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.629> in<00:03:42.780> his

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
weapons because Vegeta did that in his

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.349 
weapons because Vegeta did that in his
video<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.470> took<00:03:43.680> well<00:03:44.340> over<00:03:44.370> 20<00:03:44.940> minutes<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
video and it took well over 20 minutes I

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.960 
video and it took well over 20 minutes I
think<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.829> go<00:03:47.010> over<00:03:47.220> all<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.459> weapons<00:03:47.819> this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
think to go over all the weapons this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.960 
think to go over all the weapons this
sword<00:03:48.209> there<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.019> kit<00:03:49.650> comes<00:03:49.829> with<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.879> I'm

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
sword there this kit comes with so I'm

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.580 
sword there this kit comes with so I'm
gonna<00:03:51.120> skip<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:51.810> show<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
gonna skip that and just show you the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.170 
gonna skip that and just show you the
finished<00:03:53.160> painted<00:03:53.519> paint<00:03:54.000> job<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:56.180> guess

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
finished painted paint job and I guess

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.759 
finished painted paint job and I guess
we<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.329> get<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.569> little<00:03:57.720> closer<00:03:58.049> as<00:03:58.319> well<00:04:00.769> just

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
we can get a little closer as well just

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.180 
we can get a little closer as well just
do<00:04:01.949> I<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> nicer<00:04:02.730> look<00:04:03.569> at<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.840> kit

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.970 

and<00:04:08.190> some<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> finer<00:04:09.360> details<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.830> can

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
and some of the finer details you can

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.990 
and some of the finer details you can
see<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.160> spot<00:04:14.970> there<00:04:15.210> where<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:17.280> chrome<00:04:17.610> didn't

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
see a spot there where the chrome didn't

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.480 
see a spot there where the chrome didn't
go<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.450> very<00:04:18.930> well<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:23.130> there<00:04:23.280> are<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.370> few

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
go on very well and so there are a few

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.070 
go on very well and so there are a few
spots<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.000> are<00:04:24.120> just<00:04:24.270> kind<00:04:24.420> of<00:04:24.540> rough<00:04:24.870> like

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
spots that are just kind of rough like

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:45.470 
spots that are just kind of rough like
that<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:32.120> little<00:04:33.120> further<00:04:33.450> down<00:04:33.780> oh<00:04:44.090> yeah<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
that a little further down oh yeah the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.960 
that a little further down oh yeah the
lighting<00:04:45.870> so<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:48.620> did<00:04:49.620> him<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.370> light<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.730> kit

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
lighting so I did him to light this kit

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.400 
lighting so I did him to light this kit
oops<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:52.850> used<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> 555<00:04:54.810> timer<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.350> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
oops and used like a 555 timer and to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.880 
oops and used like a 555 timer and to
make<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:56.450> GN<00:04:57.450> drives<00:04:57.750> like<00:04:58.050> blink<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.650> stuff

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
make the GN drives like blink and stuff

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.200 
make the GN drives like blink and stuff
but<00:04:59.460> after<00:05:00.240> building<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:00.990> kit<00:05:01.940> it's<00:05:02.940> so

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
but after building this kit it's so

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.660 
but after building this kit it's so
skinny<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:05.100> chest<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:05.940> small

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
skinny in the chest is just so small

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.180 
skinny in the chest is just so small
that<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.760> decided<00:05:09.090> not<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> do<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:10.100> would<00:05:11.100> have

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that I decided not to do it I would have

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.750 
that I decided not to do it I would have
had<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.490> use<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.790> power<00:05:12.360> supply<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.490> had<00:05:14.490> to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
had to use a power supply and had to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.970 
had to use a power supply and had to
have<00:05:14.970> wired<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.080> until<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.470> action<00:05:16.770> base

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
have wired that until I can action base

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.310 
have wired that until I can action base
or<00:05:17.250> something<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:18.960> didn't<00:05:19.140> want<00:05:19.290> to

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
or something and I just didn't want to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.420 
or something and I just didn't want to
do<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.500> with<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:19.920> kit

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
do that with this kit

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.140 
do that with this kit
I<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:21.240> wanted<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:22.250> display<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.460> by<00:05:23.820> itself

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
I just wanted to display it by itself

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.360 
I just wanted to display it by itself
without<00:05:24.420> an<00:05:24.720> action<00:05:25.050> base<00:05:25.200> or<00:05:25.470> anything<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.130> I

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
without an action base or anything so I

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:43.530 
without an action base or anything so I
decided<00:05:27.300> not<00:05:27.510> to<00:05:27.570> do<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:31.460> but<00:05:34.100> yeah

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.580 

so<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.570> think<00:05:44.660> that's<00:05:44.930> gonna<00:05:45.080> do<00:05:45.260> it<00:05:45.350> for<00:05:45.380> this

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
so I think that's gonna do it for this

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.540 
so I think that's gonna do it for this
video<00:05:46.070> guys<00:05:46.390> hopefully<00:05:47.390> you<00:05:47.660> guys<00:05:47.840> enjoyed
