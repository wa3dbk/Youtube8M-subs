Pike<00:02:34.970> spearing<00:02:35.450> we<00:02:35.540> hope<00:02:35.780> we've<00:02:36.680> been<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
Pike spearing we hope we've been on the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.340 
Pike spearing we hope we've been on the
ice<00:02:37.160> for<00:02:37.250> about<00:02:37.520> 4<00:02:37.760> hours<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:39.050> yet<00:02:39.320> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
ice for about 4 hours and have yet to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.440 
ice for about 4 hours and have yet to
have<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> flag<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> fish<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> hole<00:02:41.180> so

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
have a flag or a fish in the hole so

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
have a flag or a fish in the hole so
it's<00:02:41.570> been<00:02:41.690> pretty<00:02:41.720> slow<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.920> water<00:02:43.130> is

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's been pretty slow the water is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 
it's been pretty slow the water is
slowly<00:02:43.550> getting<00:02:44.030> more<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.330> more<00:02:44.420> murky<00:02:44.989> so

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
slowly getting more and more murky so

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.390 
slowly getting more and more murky so
we're<00:02:45.410> not<00:02:45.470> sure<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.709> that's<00:02:45.830> gonna<00:02:46.010> help<00:02:46.190> or

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
we're not sure if that's gonna help or

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.740 
we're not sure if that's gonna help or
hurt<00:02:46.520> us<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.940> we're<00:02:47.180> hoping<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.570> we're

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
hurt us so we're hoping that we're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.360 
hurt us so we're hoping that we're
coming<00:02:47.930> right<00:02:48.260> into<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.590> best<00:02:48.770> stretch<00:02:49.070> here

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
coming right into the best stretch here

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.370 
coming right into the best stretch here
hopefully<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.030> get<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.180> fish<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.600> we've<00:02:51.140> yet<00:02:51.320> to

hopefully we get a fish in we've yet to
see<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:51.860> or<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> flag<00:02:52.520> go<00:02:52.730> up<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.120> we're
