00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.950
 let's start making a ponytail 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.789
 we can do it whole backwards or 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.880
 leave your bangs loose 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.930
 we are going to comb it well and we have it with 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.940
 a big rubber 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.140
 we will take several turns until the 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.140
 let's note well subject 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.550
 once the pigtail is made 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.400
 we are going to place the little hairs that we 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.800
 have been able to get out of this and we take a 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.500
 comb and a little bit of lacquer we anoint the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.650
 lacquer on the comb and we had it already 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.880
 continuation of the comb we pass the hand 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.260
 we do this so that the queue 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.329
 be perfect 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.420
 once our queue is perfect 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.100
 let's separate a small lock from 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 down the queue 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.979
 we separated them and now what we do is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 surround all the pigtail with that lock 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.580
 whole and we can even give you two 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.580
 turn that to your liking 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.690
 We had a good time stretching the lock to 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.880
 that the pigtail is not visible and we will hold the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.610
 tuft under with two forks 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.210
 closed 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.620
 we put them well and we'll put one in 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 one direction 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.090
 and the other box in the other direction 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.210
 so we'll make sure that the lock 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.040
 hold on your site all the time 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.890
 and it stays that way 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.590
 in the second option we are going to separate 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.550
 just another lock and we're going to make a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.530
 simple three-strand braid 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.130
 we separated the three strands and started 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.130
 to braid 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.360
 you can also make a braid of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.710
 Tang me this time I made it simple 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.079
 once we have all the lock 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 braided we take a small rubber band and 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.130
 we hold the braid 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.420
 we're fine braid so you do not 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420
 undo 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.579
 and the operation this time is going to be the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.269
 same as before we are going to surround the rubber band 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.349
 with the braid until you can not see 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.030
 depending on the length of your hair 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.430
 you will give a turn or two 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 we surround the pigtail well we make sure 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.409
 that is full cover 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.870
 and we are going to hold the braid of it 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.200
 way with two forks one towards each 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200
 side 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.320
 the forks will be closed 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.130
 one sideways 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.769
 and another one towards others 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.080
 Well, you 've already seen that taking our 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.380
 pigtails is very easy 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.570
 This is the result and I hope to see you very 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.280
 soon in the next video little fingers 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.280
 up if you liked it and we are waiting for you 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.960

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.960
