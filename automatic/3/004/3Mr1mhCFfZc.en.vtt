different antennas one is the short one
for<00:01:36.420> TX<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.080> for<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> RX<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.180> going

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
for TX and for the RX so what I'm going

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.240 
for TX and for the RX so what I'm going
to<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.650> short

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to do I'm going to take this short

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
to do I'm going to take this short
antenna<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.150> yellow<00:01:42.480> cables<00:01:42.900> out<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
antenna with these yellow cables out and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.360 
antenna with these yellow cables out and
mount<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.760> my<00:01:45.260> Skywalker<00:01:46.260> on<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.800> nose<00:01:47.010> and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
mount it on my Skywalker on the nose and

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.350 
mount it on my Skywalker on the nose and
keep<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> vertical<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.610> plan<00:01:50.940> that<00:01:51.330> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
keep it vertical this is my plan that I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.920 
keep it vertical this is my plan that I
will<00:01:51.660> actually<00:01:52.610> put<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.300> on<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
will actually put it right here on the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.520 
will actually put it right here on the
nose<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.530> keep<00:01:55.980> it<00:01:56.190> vertical<00:01:56.750> okay<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:58.410> right

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
nose and keep it vertical okay all right

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.610 
nose and keep it vertical okay all right
the<00:01:59.190> other<00:01:59.490> RX<00:02:00.030> antenna<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> gotta<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.440> on

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
the other RX antenna I gotta put it on

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.170 
the other RX antenna I gotta put it on
the<00:02:01.800> floor<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.510> can<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:04.790> this<00:02:05.790> antenna

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the floor and you can see this antenna

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.410 
the floor and you can see this antenna
is<00:02:06.510> longer<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.800> is<00:02:07.980> for<00:02:08.250> bigger<00:02:08.700> airplane<00:02:09.269> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is longer this is for bigger airplane so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
is longer this is for bigger airplane so
if<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.750> bigger<00:02:09.929> airplanes<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.800> use

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
if you have bigger airplanes you can use

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.330 
if you have bigger airplanes you can use
the<00:02:11.129> longer<00:02:11.519> antenna<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.840> rx<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the longer antenna for your rx and so I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.430 
the longer antenna for your rx and so I
was<00:02:14.580> also<00:02:15.030> considering<00:02:15.769> mounting<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.950> like

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
was also considering mounting it like

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.250 
was also considering mounting it like
just<00:02:19.519> thought<00:02:20.519> mounting<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.599> like<00:02:21.780> all<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
just thought mounting it like all the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.089 
just thought mounting it like all the
way<00:02:22.409> back<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.569> keep<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.750> vertical<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.590> on

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
way back and keep it vertical there on

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.009 
way back and keep it vertical there on
the<00:02:26.250> tail<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:26.909> anyway<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.750> keep<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the tail but anyway I want to keep it

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.740 
the tail but anyway I want to keep it
away<00:02:28.260> from<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.830> video<00:02:29.190> transmitter<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
away from the video transmitter here and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.890 
away from the video transmitter here and
the<00:02:31.020> motor<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> stuff<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.730> my<00:02:32.880> plan<00:02:33.210> is

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the motor and stuff so what my plan is

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.250 
the motor and stuff so what my plan is
mount<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.890> RX<00:02:35.489> somewhere<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
mount the RX somewhere here on the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.580 
mount the RX somewhere here on the

bottom near the FY 21 AP and extend the
internet<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.220> nose<00:02:41.400> okay<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.650> best

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
internet to the nose okay and the best

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.869 
internet to the nose okay and the best
thing<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.519> beb<00:02:44.970> RC<00:02:45.480> sent<00:02:45.689> me<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.189> this<00:02:47.189> long

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
thing that beb RC sent me is this long

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.140 
thing that beb RC sent me is this long
antenna<00:02:48.689> for<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.140> TX<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.340> channeling<00:02:50.790> TX

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
antenna for the TX the channeling TX

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.830 
antenna for the TX the channeling TX
it's<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.599> half<00:02:52.189> wavelength<00:02:53.189> antenna<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.689> is

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's a half wavelength antenna and it is

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
it's a half wavelength antenna and it is
supposed<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> give<00:02:55.470> us<00:02:55.560> better<00:02:55.799> range<00:02:56.250> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
supposed to give us better range so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.229 
supposed to give us better range so
anyway<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.959> cannot<00:02:58.290> go<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.370> know<00:02:59.489> beyond<00:02:59.879> 10

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
anyway I cannot go you know beyond 10

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.050 
anyway I cannot go you know beyond 10
kilometer<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:01.140> my<00:03:01.319> Skywalker<00:03:02.060> batteries

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
kilometer because my Skywalker batteries

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.970 
kilometer because my Skywalker batteries
always<00:03:03.359> run<00:03:03.540> out<00:03:03.659> but<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.079> time<00:03:04.260> he<00:03:04.470> will<00:03:04.650> try

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
always run out but this time he will try

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.129 
always run out but this time he will try
something<00:03:05.519> what<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> did<00:03:06.389> on<00:03:06.569> my<00:03:06.599> foot<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.109> a

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
something what I did on my foot have a

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.780 
something what I did on my foot have a
tendency<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.159> remove<00:03:08.609> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
tendency is that I remove the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.740 
tendency is that I remove the
transmitter<00:03:10.519> what<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:11.760> crystal<00:03:12.329> yeah<00:03:12.540> I

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
transmitter what is that crystal yeah I

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.479 
transmitter what is that crystal yeah I
removed<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> transmitter<00:03:13.739> crystal<00:03:14.250> from

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
removed the transmitter crystal from

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.539 
removed the transmitter crystal from
inside<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:16.109> futaba<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.980> transmitting

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
inside so the futaba is not transmitting

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.970 
inside so the futaba is not transmitting
anything<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.269> turn<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.599> on<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.959> using<00:03:19.859> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
anything if I turn it on and using the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.979 
anything if I turn it on and using the
CL<00:03:20.370> channeling<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> will<00:03:21.329> be<00:03:21.420> transmitting

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
CL channeling it will be transmitting

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.229 
CL channeling it will be transmitting
only<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> qinling<00:03:23.189> that's<00:03:23.670> not<00:03:23.879> causing

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
only to the qinling that's not causing

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.149 
only to the qinling that's not causing
interference<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:25.019> other<00:03:25.260> friends<00:03:25.769> who<00:03:25.980> are

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
interference to other friends who are

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.099 
interference to other friends who are
flying<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.609> there<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.150> also<00:03:27.540> won't<00:03:27.840> cause

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
flying out there and also won't cause

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.379 
flying out there and also won't cause
any<00:03:28.349> interference<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.189> the<00:03:29.310> chain<00:03:29.519> link<00:03:29.730> so

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
any interference to the chain link so

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.910 
any interference to the chain link so
this<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.569> what<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.109> do<00:03:31.319> now<00:03:31.500> I'm

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
this is what I'm going to do now I'm

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.119 
this is what I'm going to do now I'm
going<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.340> back<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.700> my<00:03:32.849> Skywalker<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
going to get back to my Skywalker and

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.250 
going to get back to my Skywalker and
set<00:03:35.129> everything<00:03:35.280> up<00:03:35.639> inside<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:37.049> we

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
set everything up inside and then we

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:50.410 
set everything up inside and then we
will<00:03:37.349> go<00:03:37.409> out<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.010> give<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.430> flight

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.450 

Oh
