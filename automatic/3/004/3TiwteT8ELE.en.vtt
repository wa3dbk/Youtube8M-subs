00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
link in the description on how to do

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.939 
link in the description on how to do
that<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.500> very<00:00:52.500> simple<00:00:52.829> takes<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.340> seconds

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
that it's very simple takes two seconds

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.180 
that it's very simple takes two seconds
so<00:00:55.949> i'll<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.640> trailer<00:00:57.059> park<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
so i'll just use trailer park one and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
so i'll just use trailer park one and
you'll<00:00:59.190> drag<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> onto<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> background<00:01:01.250> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you'll drag it onto the background so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
you'll drag it onto the background so
then<00:01:02.489> there's<00:01:03.149> picture<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.430 
out it doesn't want to realistic so what
you<00:02:41.620> want<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.830> do<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.550> delight<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.290> can

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
you want to do is a delight if you can

00:02:44.440 --> 00:03:05.670 
you want to do is a delight if you can
find<00:02:44.680> it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.770 

alright<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:06.790> once<00:03:06.969> you<00:03:07.090> got<00:03:07.209> your<00:03:07.329> light<00:03:07.510> just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
alright so once you got your light just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.130 
alright so once you got your light just
drag<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.109> up<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> good<00:03:10.180> place<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.870> you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
drag it up to a good place that you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.420 
drag it up to a good place that you
think<00:03:11.379> is<00:03:11.530> good<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.430> go<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.390> shadow<00:03:14.430> go

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
think is good and just go to shadow go

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.099 
think is good and just go to shadow go
to<00:03:15.489> make<00:03:16.150> sure<00:03:16.299> shadow<00:03:16.629> map<00:03:17.409> soft<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.159> on<00:03:18.340> and

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
to make sure shadow map soft is on and

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.899 
to make sure shadow map soft is on and
then<00:03:20.109> if<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.379> render<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.829> out<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.609> it

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
then if you render it out it's a it

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.170 
then if you render it out it's a it
looks<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.209> bit<00:03:23.109> more<00:03:23.290> realistic<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.120> now<00:03:25.120> you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
looks a bit more realistic and now you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.959 
looks a bit more realistic and now you
want<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.599> add<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:26.620> little<00:03:26.769> bit<00:03:27.310> gloss<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.849> the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:27.969 
want to add a little bit gloss to the

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.539 
want to add a little bit gloss to the
text<00:03:28.389> to<00:03:28.659> the<00:03:28.810> text<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.310> choose<00:03:30.489> your

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
text to the text so just choose your

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.780 
text to the text so just choose your
color<00:03:30.730> I'd<00:03:31.209> use<00:03:31.269> gray<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.349> go<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.069> reflection

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
color I'd use gray and go to reflection

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.149 
color I'd use gray and go to reflection
texture<00:03:34.889> for<00:03:35.889> now<00:03:36.269> put<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.709> furnace<00:03:38.709> around

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
texture for now put the furnace around

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.809 
texture for now put the furnace around
40<00:03:39.909> and<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.799> mixed<00:03:41.799> rents<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.730> around<00:03:42.970> 35<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
40 and the mixed rents to around 35 and

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.339 
40 and the mixed rents to around 35 and
to<00:03:45.819> make<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.000> more<00:03:46.120> glossy<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.139> pull

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
to make it more glossy you just pull

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.409 
to make it more glossy you just pull
this<00:03:47.439> up<00:03:47.669> but<00:03:48.669> i'm<00:03:48.790> just<00:03:48.970> going<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.150> use<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.389> a

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
this up but i'm just going to use it a

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.330 
this up but i'm just going to use it a
little<00:03:49.540> bit<00:03:49.689> right<00:03:49.840> there<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.889> that's<00:03:51.069> good

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
little bit right there so that's good

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.220 
little bit right there so that's good
and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.810> drag<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.079> onto<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.379> mo<00:03:53.500> text<00:03:53.950> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
and then drag it onto the mo text and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:09.860 
and then drag it onto the mo text and
then<00:03:57.359> looks<00:03:58.359> more<00:03:58.629> realistic<00:03:59.019> than<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.829> would

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.440 

so<00:04:10.530> yes<00:04:11.489> about<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.549> also<00:04:14.700> make<00:04:15.420> a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
so yes about it you can also make a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.879 
so yes about it you can also make a
video<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.199> if<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.650> go<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.019> last<00:04:19.169> frame<00:04:19.320> and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
video so if I go to the last frame and

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.159 
video so if I go to the last frame and
I'll<00:04:20.310> put<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.820> bottom<00:04:20.970> how<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> add<00:04:22.139> a

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
I'll put it to the bottom how to add a

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.620 
I'll put it to the bottom how to add a
keyframe<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.400> very<00:04:23.580> end<00:04:23.729> or<00:04:24.090> wherever

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
keyframe go to the very end or wherever

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.439 
keyframe go to the very end or wherever
you<00:04:24.690> want<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.020> appear<00:04:26.060> just<00:04:27.060> told<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
you want it to appear just told the

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.659 
you want it to appear just told the
middle<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.930> break<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.560> frame<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.070> make<00:04:29.550> it

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
middle and break you frame and make it

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.510 
middle and break you frame and make it
come<00:04:29.910> up<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.810> where<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.960> want<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:32.330> then

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
come up to where I want it and then

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.680 
come up to where I want it and then
