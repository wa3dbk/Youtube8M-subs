you're gonna get an ortholite tag and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.610 
you're gonna get an ortholite tag and
then<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.450> i'm<00:00:46.140> guessing<00:00:46.500> which

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
then you're gonna get i'm guessing which

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
then you're gonna get i'm guessing which
would<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> earth<00:00:47.370> why<00:00:47.579> Tinsel's<00:00:48.030> it's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
would be the to earth why Tinsel's it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.369 
would be the to earth why Tinsel's it's
very<00:00:49.350> thin<00:00:49.739> minimalistic<00:00:50.870> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> soft<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
very thin minimalistic kind of soft and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
very thin minimalistic kind of soft and
squishy<00:00:52.680> though<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.940> feels<00:00:54.120> pretty<00:00:54.210> good

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
squishy though so it feels pretty good

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.189 
squishy though so it feels pretty good
and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:56.030> like<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.199> foot

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and then it's kind of like a foot

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.200 
and then it's kind of like a foot
mapping<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> um<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.600> yeah<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.739> pretty<00:01:01.890> thin

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
mapping and um i yeah it's pretty thin

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
mapping and um i yeah it's pretty thin
I'm<00:01:03.210> guessing<00:01:03.539> those<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.930> extra<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I'm guessing those are like extra and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
I'm guessing those are like extra and
then<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> inside<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
then on the inside you do have like a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
then on the inside you do have like a
Sun<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.640> mount<00:01:08.760> take

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
Sun in and so that you can mount take

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.429 
Sun in and so that you can mount take
out<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.290> are

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
out so that's probably what these are

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.399 
out so that's probably what these are
for<00:01:10.650> probably<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.820> cushion<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
for probably for more cushion on the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
for probably for more cushion on the
inside<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> says<00:01:14.070> run<00:01:14.310> natural<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
inside it says run natural and then it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
inside it says run natural and then it
says<00:01:15.210> adidas<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.950> doesn't<00:01:17.310> come<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.549> um

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
says adidas and that doesn't come out um

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.620 
says adidas and that doesn't come out um
it<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:20.220> feels<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.790> stuff<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> mean<00:01:21.479> I'm

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it it feels kind of stuff but I mean I'm

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
it it feels kind of stuff but I mean I'm
pretty<00:01:21.869> sure<00:01:22.110> wouldn't<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.619> comfortable<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
pretty sure wouldn't be comfortable to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
pretty sure wouldn't be comfortable to
run<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:24.020> considering<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.320> running

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
run in considering these are running

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.719 
run in considering these are running
shoes<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.950> wouldn't<00:01:26.159> use<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
shoes but I wouldn't use them for that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
shoes but I wouldn't use them for that
on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> bottom<00:01:28.790> take<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.079> these

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
on the bottom take it I did use these

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.039 
on the bottom take it I did use these
these<00:01:31.530> aren't<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
these aren't they don't come like this

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
these aren't they don't come like this
obviously<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> reminds<00:01:35.610> me<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> like

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
obviously it kind of reminds me of like

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
obviously it kind of reminds me of like
a<00:01:36.060> waffle<00:01:36.299> style<00:01:36.900> design<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.799> flex<00:01:38.130> points

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a waffle style design like flex points

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
a waffle style design like flex points
of<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.479> running<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.439> running

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
of where you would running this running

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.380 
of where you would running this running
shoe<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.340> probably<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> can

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
shoe is probably so that way you can

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
shoe is probably so that way you can
feel<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.840> more<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.740> aren't<00:01:43.979> bare<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
feel like more like your aren't bare you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
feel like more like your aren't bare you
know<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.420> anything<00:01:45.630> restricting

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
know you don't have anything restricting

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.270 
know you don't have anything restricting
you<00:01:46.610> because<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.320> realistic<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you because let's be realistic this is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880 
you because let's be realistic this is
basically<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.970> another<00:01:51.210> sock<00:01:51.710> there's<00:01:52.710> no

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
basically like another sock there's no

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.749 
basically like another sock there's no
support<00:01:55.219> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> interesting<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
support this is interesting it has the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.690 
support this is interesting it has the
