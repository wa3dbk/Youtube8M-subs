level<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:15.189> right<00:01:17.280> kind<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.399> little<00:01:18.579> trick

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
level all right kind of a little trick

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.969 
level all right kind of a little trick
to<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.420> do<00:01:19.569> without<00:01:19.780> having<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.350> put

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
to it you can do without having to put

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.600 
to it you can do without having to put
it<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.539> hole<00:01:23.020> if<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:23.979> just<00:01:24.189> take<00:01:24.369> two

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
it in the hole if you just take two

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.359 
it in the hole if you just take two
steaks<00:01:24.939> but<00:01:25.600> across<00:01:25.780> one<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.439> down<00:01:26.649> you're

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
steaks but across one going down you're

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.029 
steaks but across one going down you're
going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.579> measure<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:28.060> we're<00:01:28.780> at<00:01:28.959> the<00:01:29.110> bottom

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
going to measure it we're at the bottom

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.059 
going to measure it we're at the bottom
of<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.659> top<00:01:31.899> state<00:01:32.259> because<00:01:32.890> that's

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
of it the top state because that's

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.870 
of it the top state because that's
actually<00:01:33.520> where<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.759> grammar<00:01:34.000> would

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually where the grammar would

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
actually where the grammar would
all<00:01:35.270> right<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:37.130> top<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.579> my<00:01:37.670> finger<00:01:38.030> there

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.179 

so<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.939> hold<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:42.840> deep<00:01:43.189> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so this hold a little bit too deep and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.789 
so this hold a little bit too deep and
again<00:01:44.520> remember<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.270> hand<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.200> shovel<00:01:46.619> rule

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
again remember the hand and shovel rule

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
again remember the hand and shovel rule
it's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.700> rule<00:01:50.909> goes<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.350> someone<00:01:52.530> has<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it's the rule goes not if someone has a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289

job<00:02:54.299> most<00:02:54.630> every<00:02:54.900> tree<00:02:55.079> has<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.350> fan<00:02:55.859> who<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
job most every tree has a fan who the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.599 
job most every tree has a fan who the
branches<00:02:57.389> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.829> want<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.579> want

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
branches you can see we want is you want

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.379 
branches you can see we want is you want
the<00:02:59.880> fan<00:03:00.799> parallel<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> road<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.269> it

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
the fan parallel to the road so it

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.660 
the fan parallel to the road so it
doesn't<00:03:03.690> go<00:03:03.780> into<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.290> road<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:05.190> get<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.400> fan

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
doesn't go into the road we get the fan

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.270 
doesn't go into the road we get the fan
right<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> fan<00:03:07.950> sort<00:03:08.220> of

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
right so we have I see a fan sort of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.530 
right so we have I see a fan sort of
right<00:03:08.430> here

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
right here

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.390 
right here
