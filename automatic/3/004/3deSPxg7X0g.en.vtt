00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
decided to go with his stackable unit

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
tricky in that the old plumbing was

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.180 
tricky in that the old plumbing was
never<00:02:29.840> been<00:02:30.080> incorrectly<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.800> that's<00:02:30.920> what

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.480 
caused all the problems we're going to
VIN<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.140> correctly<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.890> drain<00:02:34.130> will<00:02:34.340> run

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
VIN it correctly so the drain will run

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.340 
VIN it correctly so the drain will run
nice<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.970> free<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.450> fast<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.020> they'll<00:02:36.140> be<00:02:36.230> no

this<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.790> over<00:03:32.239> layman<00:03:32.660> out<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.230> old

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
this is the over layman out of the old

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.040 
this is the over layman out of the old
wood<00:03:34.190> subfloor<00:03:34.550> we<00:03:35.150> peeled<00:03:35.420> up<00:03:35.600> these<00:03:35.780> old

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
wood subfloor we peeled up these old

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.030 
wood subfloor we peeled up these old
these<00:03:36.350> old<00:03:36.850> vinyl<00:03:37.850> tiles<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.660> we<00:03:39.500> found<00:03:39.830> that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
these old vinyl tiles and we found that

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.530 
these old vinyl tiles and we found that
the<00:03:40.220> termites<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.940> actually<00:03:41.330> been<00:03:41.480> working

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
the termites have actually been working

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.830 
the termites have actually been working
heavily<00:03:42.140> on<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.920> over<00:03:43.250> layman<00:03:43.640> I'm<00:03:44.209> hoping

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
heavily on the over layman I'm hoping

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840 
heavily on the over layman I'm hoping
that<00:03:45.110> when<00:03:45.860> they<00:03:45.950> built<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.310> house<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:46.790> at

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
that when they built the house they at

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.030 
that when they built the house they at
least<00:03:47.030> put<00:03:47.300> tar<00:03:47.540> paper<00:03:47.840> under<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.380> between<00:03:48.860> the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
least put tar paper under it between the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.250 
least put tar paper under it between the
two<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.730> I'm<00:03:49.940> hoping<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.480> didn't<00:03:50.780> get<00:03:50.930> into<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
two so I'm hoping it didn't get into the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.990 
two so I'm hoping it didn't get into the
subfloor<00:03:51.800> but<00:03:51.980> we<00:03:52.100> won't<00:03:52.310> know<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.670> till<00:03:52.910> we

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
subfloor but we won't know that till we

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520 
subfloor but we won't know that till we
get<00:03:53.150> into<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.510> further<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.989> remove<00:03:54.260> this

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
get into this further and remove this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.340 
get into this further and remove this
but<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.519> kind<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.820> stuff<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.150> we<00:03:56.870> we

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
but this is the kind of stuff that we we

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.290 
but this is the kind of stuff that we we
like<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.680> catch<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.459> know<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.610> mean<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.910> noticed

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
like to catch you know I mean I noticed

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.790 
like to catch you know I mean I noticed
this<00:03:59.510> when<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.750> first<00:04:00.050> looked<00:04:00.320> there<00:04:00.680> was<00:04:00.739> a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
this when I first looked there was a

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.400 
this when I first looked there was a
couple<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.190> places<00:04:01.730> showing<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.140> realized

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
couple of places showing and I realized

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.180 
couple of places showing and I realized
you<00:04:03.770> know

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you know

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.830 
you know
this<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.580> probably<00:04:04.940> worse<00:04:05.300> than<00:04:05.330> what<00:04:05.690> we're

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
this is probably worse than what we're

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.050 
this is probably worse than what we're
looking<00:04:06.110> at<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.590> fact<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.250> so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
looking at and in fact it is so

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.330 
looking at and in fact it is so
hopefully<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.050> hasn't<00:04:09.260> completely<00:04:09.770> got<00:04:10.070> into

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
hopefully it hasn't completely got into

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.100 
hopefully it hasn't completely got into
the<00:04:10.430> subfloor<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.120> completely<00:04:11.570> destroying

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
the subfloor it is completely destroying

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.410 
the subfloor it is completely destroying
the<00:04:12.290> overlay<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.040> I'm<00:04:13.310> hoping<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.910> tar

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
the overlay and I'm hoping that tar

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.199 
the overlay and I'm hoping that tar
paper<00:04:14.660> might've<00:04:15.110> kept<00:04:16.100> them<00:04:16.280> up<00:04:16.430> here<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:16.850> how

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
paper might've kept them up here and how

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.449 
paper might've kept them up here and how
did<00:04:17.420> your<00:04:17.600> bathroom<00:04:18.200> remodels<00:04:18.620> turn<00:04:18.769> out<00:04:18.890> if

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
did your bathroom remodels turn out if

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.140 
did your bathroom remodels turn out if
you're<00:04:19.610> not<00:04:19.760> great<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.810> know<00:04:21.700> it's<00:04:22.700> hard<00:04:22.940> to

you're not great you know it's hard to

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.600 
you're not great you know it's hard to

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
to explain how much different they are

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.300 
to explain how much different they are
because<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.930> know<00:04:27.080> we<00:04:27.290> did<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.650> last<00:04:27.680> winter

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
because you know we did that last winter

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.880
