let's come out nice feature you know
it's<00:03:10.110> kind<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.380> easier<00:03:10.709> than<00:03:10.920> going<00:03:11.520> ahead<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
it's kind of easier than going ahead and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.480 
it's kind of easier than going ahead and
using<00:03:12.000> my<00:03:12.300> curling<00:03:12.660> iron<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.170> well<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:14.100> says<00:03:14.370> on

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
using my curling iron as well it says on

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.740 
using my curling iron as well it says on
here<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:16.910> its<00:03:17.910> salts<00:03:18.420> drawing

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
here that this is its salts drawing

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.810 
here that this is its salts drawing
plates<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.410> 100%<00:03:20.930> ceramic<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
plates and it's 100% ceramic and the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.460 
plates and it's 100% ceramic and the
thing<00:03:24.000> about<00:03:24.180> ceramic<00:03:24.840> why<00:03:25.050> it's<00:03:25.260> so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
thing about ceramic why it's so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.120 
thing about ceramic why it's so
important

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
important

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.440 
important
ceramic<00:03:27.110> prevents<00:03:28.110> your<00:03:28.380> um<00:03:28.800> your<00:03:29.280> hair<00:03:29.640> from

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
ceramic prevents your um your hair from

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.290 
ceramic prevents your um your hair from
receiving<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.200> much<00:03:31.350> heat<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.300> getting

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
receiving so much heat and getting

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.130 
receiving so much heat and getting
damaged<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.670> that's<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.480> why<00:03:36.720> he

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
damaged so I think that's kind of why he

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.800 
damaged so I think that's kind of why he
was<00:03:37.290> saying

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
was saying

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.810 
was saying
hair<00:03:39.810> straighteners<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.790> they'll<00:03:41.790> say

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
hair straighteners like this they'll say

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.750 
hair straighteners like this they'll say
that<00:03:42.239> ceramic<00:03:43.019> plates<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.160> it'll<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.730> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
that ceramic plates but it'll just be a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.460 
that ceramic plates but it'll just be a
coating<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.330> ceramic<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.019> won't<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.440> a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
coating of ceramic it won't be a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.280 
coating of ceramic it won't be a
complete<00:03:47.070> plate<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.790> ceramic<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:49.110> that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
complete plate of ceramic and what that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.949 
complete plate of ceramic and what that
ends<00:03:49.470> up<00:03:49.590> doing<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.950> damaging<00:03:50.580> your<00:03:50.640> hair<00:03:51.000> so
