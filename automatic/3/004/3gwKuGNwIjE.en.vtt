00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.189
 greetings to all here and it's my time 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.849
 Apparently try to river then I decided 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.089
 start with the simplest of something namely with 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.810
 order hatch based on a sliding node or 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:25.430
 slipknot slipknot or it is also called 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 it's very simple here on the one hand 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.099
 left i leave for well here 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.329
 approximately did not count how long 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.050
 it will be dark but then it will be in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 the result is longer, well, approximately 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.960
 about how long we want 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.640
 Lanyard leave here this tail here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.289
 I'm here a piece of paracord 65 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.239
 centimeters long can actually 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.930
 far less i think that over it 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 crustacean 40 45 centimeters for the eyes is enough 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 and what's next next we are about to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:10.580
 mid- mid overlap it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.580
 and we start to knit with such rings 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.440
 the rings are not too tight for 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 so then because later we will 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.710
 this end stretch inside these rings 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 and make sure that their lengths of this end 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.980
 you had too many mountains of rings not 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:56.460
 we wind so another 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:58.880
 where already overdone and now we pass 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880
 inside 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.670
 that's my childhood when that fuels from 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.300
 the laces from the rope then finally one 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.300
 active end up 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.190
 fastened a pin 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.940
 hooked on a pin was very comfortable there 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.940
 you stretch 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.760
 fashion is now just slowly tightening 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.060
 one side on the other 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.920
 but it worked out such a loop 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.010
 everything 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.130
 here is such a slipknot 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.130
 principle, you can trim the extra parts 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.520
 due to 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.349
 so here you need to put 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.740
 but 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.560
 a little bit 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.120
 I do not like when it was quite dark yet 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.120
 gorillas and so on on the boat 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.120
 a little bit 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.209
 little body comes 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.740
 here is such a not really love well though 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.050
 of course can tough comfortably weave there 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.070
 not like this 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.070
 billing remains 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.890
 well, that's probably all 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.780
 here is such a simple tim crustack gave if 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.530
 Slipknot 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.020
 she likes me more 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.400
 I seem to have mastered this strap so 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.169
 I will move on all thanks for 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.740
 attention and see you soon 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.740
