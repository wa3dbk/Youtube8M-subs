times through with very exception of the
last<00:01:28.240> bar<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.159> start<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:30.729> off<00:01:30.970> as

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
last bar and you can start this off as

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.390 
last bar and you can start this off as
fast<00:01:31.420> or<00:01:31.660> as<00:01:31.780> slow<00:01:31.840> as<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:33.009> do<00:01:33.220> be

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
fast or as slow as you like but do be

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.609 
fast or as slow as you like but do be
aware<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.640> each<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.630> plays<00:01:35.020> three<00:01:35.350> times

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
aware that each it plays three times

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.990 
aware that each it plays three times
through<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.100> each<00:01:36.280> time<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.580> play<00:01:36.820> those

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
through so each time you play those

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.760 
through so each time you play those
three<00:01:37.300> times<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:37.990> are<00:01:38.170> supposed<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.680> be

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
three times you are supposed to be

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.399 
three times you are supposed to be
starting<00:01:39.040> each<00:01:39.369> one<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.820> little<00:01:39.909> bit<00:01:40.750> faster

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
starting each one a little bit faster

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.190 
starting each one a little bit faster
and<00:01:41.650> maybe<00:01:42.460> even<00:01:42.790> getting<00:01:42.970> faster<00:01:43.600> throughout

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and maybe even getting faster throughout

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.140 
and maybe even getting faster throughout
so<00:01:44.530> what<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.130> don't<00:01:45.400> want<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.640> be<00:01:45.729> doing<00:01:45.909> is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
whole thing is just really really simple

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.900 
whole thing is just really really simple
and<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:05.920> probably<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.759> best

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
and it's it's probably one of the best

and it's it's probably one of the best
ones<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.539> book<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.960> think<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.739> I

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
ones in the book I think one that I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:21.200 
ones in the book I think one that I
enjoy<00:02:09.280> playing<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.700> most<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.080> starting<00:02:11.560> off

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.020 

so<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.870> starting<00:02:23.590> off<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> third<00:02:24.610> bar

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
so in the starting off in the third bar

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.960 
so in the starting off in the third bar
you've<00:02:25.600> got<00:02:25.780> some<00:02:26.080> C<00:02:26.410> sharps<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.160> now<00:02:27.310> those

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
you've got some C sharps so now those

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.030 
you've got some C sharps so now those
are<00:02:28.270> third<00:02:28.540> fingers<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.380> g<00:02:29.560> string<00:02:29.590> but

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
are third fingers on the g string but

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.030 
are third fingers on the g string but
they<00:02:30.190> must<00:02:30.520> be<00:02:30.640> stretched<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.780> your<00:02:32.770> third

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
they must be stretched so your third

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.310 
they must be stretched so your third
finger<00:02:33.310> would<00:02:33.550> go<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.900> third<00:02:35.110> finger

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
finger would go here on the third finger

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.190 
finger would go here on the third finger
dot<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.100> g<00:02:36.430> string<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.870> don't<00:02:38.080> forget

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
dot on the g string but don't forget

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.810 
dot on the g string but don't forget
it's<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.740> be<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.160> slightly<00:02:39.340> above

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
it's going to be just slightly above

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.010 
it's going to be just slightly above
that<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.720> slightly

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
that it's just going to be slightly

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.280 
that it's just going to be slightly
stretched<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.400> third<00:02:42.670> finger<00:02:43.000> goes<00:02:43.030> here<00:02:43.510> but

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
stretched so third finger goes here but

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
stretched so third finger goes here but
the<00:02:44.590> because<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.160> C<00:02:45.310> sharp<00:02:45.640> it's<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.940> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
the because it's C sharp it's going to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.720 
the because it's C sharp it's going to
be<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:47.320> slightly<00:02:47.680> above<00:02:47.860> there<00:02:48.280> so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
be just just slightly above there so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
be just just slightly above there so
don't<00:02:48.970> forget<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.300> stretch<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.900> or<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.260> isn't

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
don't forget to stretch that or it isn't

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.350 
don't forget to stretch that or it isn't
going<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.890> sound<00:02:51.070> very<00:02:51.160> good<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.210> put

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
going to sound very good so you can put

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.700 
going to sound very good so you can put
a<00:02:52.390> little<00:02:52.600> reminder<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.140> yourself<00:02:53.320> or

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
a little reminder to yourself or

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.860

something in the music but it does say

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.810 
something in the music but it does say
so<00:02:56.080> underneath<00:02:56.590> anyway<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.160> help<00:02:57.400> remind<00:02:57.670> you

when<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.840> get<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.200> bars

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
when you get to bars

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.320 
when you get to bars
six<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.300> eight<00:03:05.190> you've<00:03:06.190> got<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> C<00:03:06.730> natural

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
six and eight you've got a C natural

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.530 
six and eight you've got a C natural
there<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.770> just<00:03:08.800> means<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.700> second

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
there so it just means that the second

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.510 
there so it just means that the second
finger<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.530> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.710> be<00:03:11.800> right<00:03:12.070> next<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
finger is just going to be right next to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.190 
finger is just going to be right next to
the<00:03:12.670> first<00:03:12.910> finger<00:03:13.210> instead<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.780> stretched

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the first finger instead of stretched

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.630 
the first finger instead of stretched
where<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> would<00:03:14.710> normally<00:03:14.950> be

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
where it would normally be

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.180 
where it would normally be
and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.300> in<00:03:16.420> bar<00:03:16.600> eight<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:20.170> you've<00:03:20.290> got<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.740> C

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
and then in bar eight so you've got a C

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.640 
and then in bar eight so you've got a C
natural<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.510> C<00:03:22.750> sharp<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.320> you're<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.590> to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
natural and a C sharp so you're going to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.680 
natural and a C sharp so you're going to
do<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:23.950> open<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:25.170> one<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.730> back<00:03:27.730> second<00:03:28.510> which

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
do to open a a one a back second which

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.320 
do to open a a one a back second which
means<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.020> gonna<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.260> next<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.770> first

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
means it's gonna be next to the first

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.440 
means it's gonna be next to the first
then<00:03:31.330> you're<00:03:31.480> gonna<00:03:31.570> slide<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:33.300> you're<00:03:34.300> gonna

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
then you're gonna slide it you're gonna

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.810 
then you're gonna slide it you're gonna
slide<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.620> its<00:03:35.800> stretched<00:03:36.190> position<00:03:36.400> to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
slide it to its stretched position to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.030 
slide it to its stretched position to
get<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> C<00:03:37.270> sharp<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.380> you're<00:03:38.530> gonna<00:03:38.620> be<00:03:38.770> doing

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
get a C sharp so you're gonna be doing

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.140 
get a C sharp so you're gonna be doing
two<00:03:39.580> open<00:03:40.120> eyes<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:40.960> a<00:03:40.990> 1<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.620> 2<00:03:42.150> slide

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
two open eyes and then a 1 a 2 slide

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.230 
two open eyes and then a 1 a 2 slide
that<00:03:43.420> 2<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.230> then<00:03:45.010> you're<00:03:45.160> back<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> an<00:03:45.670> open<00:03:46.090> a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
that 2 and then you're back to an open a

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.540 
that 2 and then you're back to an open a
again<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.709> doesn't<00:03:47.980> matter<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.340> you're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
again so it doesn't matter that you're

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.220 
again so it doesn't matter that you're
gonna<00:03:48.670> hear<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.060> slide<00:03:49.450> that's<00:03:49.780> kind<00:03:50.050> of<00:03:50.140> the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
gonna hear that slide that's kind of the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040 
gonna hear that slide that's kind of the
point<00:03:50.410> anyway

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.500 

so<00:03:54.740> what<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.100> also<00:03:55.250> do<00:03:55.520> with<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.030> as

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
so what you can also do with that I as

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.260 
so what you can also do with that I as
well<00:03:56.770> which<00:03:57.770> appears<00:03:58.070> in<00:03:58.160> bar<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.550> sort<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.000> see

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
well which appears in bar is sort of see

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.200 
well which appears in bar is sort of see
that<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.900> an<00:04:00.050> upbeat<00:04:00.740> to<00:04:01.460> when<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.000> tune

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
that is an upbeat to when the tune

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.460 
that is an upbeat to when the tune
starts<00:04:02.570> again<00:04:02.780> where<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.020> says<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> little

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
starts again where it says a little

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.420 
starts again where it says a little
faster<00:04:04.130> now<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.680> use<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:10.370> a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
faster now so you can use that as a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.640 
faster now so you can use that as a
little<00:04:10.640> break<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.150> kind<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.450> help<00:04:11.660> you

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.240 

okay<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.739> then<00:04:16.829> you're<00:04:16.950> getting<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.160> little

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
okay and then you're getting a little

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.340 
okay and then you're getting a little
bit<00:04:17.459> faster<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.630> only<00:04:18.810> other<00:04:18.959> thing<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.200> need

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
bit faster the only other thing I need

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.870 
bit faster the only other thing I need
to<00:04:19.440> mention<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:20.040> probably<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.609> very
