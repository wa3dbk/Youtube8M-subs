ride the small surf of the good surf
right<00:00:08.920> at<00:00:09.010> about<00:00:09.160> six<00:00:09.519> inches<00:00:09.880> shorter<00:00:10.000> than<00:00:10.389> a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
right at about six inches shorter than a

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.589 
right at about six inches shorter than a
normal<00:00:10.840> board<00:00:11.099> aggressively<00:00:12.099> you<00:00:12.220> can<00:00:12.370> go

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
normal board aggressively you can go

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.360 
normal board aggressively you can go
even<00:00:13.599> eight<00:00:13.960> to<00:00:14.200> ten<00:00:14.410> inches<00:00:14.440> for<00:00:14.950> a<00:00:14.980> normal

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
even eight to ten inches for a normal

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.029 
even eight to ten inches for a normal
board<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:17.230> got<00:00:17.380> an<00:00:17.529> outline<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.150> basically

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
board it's got an outline that basically

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.790 
board it's got an outline that basically
sits<00:00:21.039> inside<00:00:21.279> of<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.880> full-size<00:00:22.600> board<00:00:23.080> so<00:00:23.470> this

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
sits inside of a full-size board so this

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.650 
sits inside of a full-size board so this
right<00:00:24.010> here<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:25.710> five<00:00:26.710> -<00:00:27.130> but<00:00:28.029> if<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.480> were<00:00:28.539> to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
right here is five - but if you were to

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.230 
right here is five - but if you were to
extend<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.050> tail<00:00:29.289> out<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.699> normal<00:00:31.029> tail

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
extend the tail out to the normal tail

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.270 
extend the tail out to the normal tail
width<00:00:32.670> like<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:33.969> and<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.949> nose<00:00:37.799> to<00:00:38.799> a<00:00:38.829> normal

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
width like this and the nose to a normal

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.739 
width like this and the nose to a normal
nose<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.969> would<00:00:43.089> end<00:00:43.239> up<00:00:43.329> being<00:00:43.629> about

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
nose like so it would end up being about

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.549 
nose like so it would end up being about
a<00:00:43.870> 5/10<00:00:45.209> so<00:00:46.209> basically<00:00:46.780> anything<00:00:47.049> that's<00:00:47.289> not

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
a 5/10 so basically anything that's not

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.639 
a 5/10 so basically anything that's not
really<00:00:47.889> used<00:00:48.219> not<00:00:49.030> needed<00:00:49.510> just<00:00:50.049> taken<00:00:50.499> out

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
really used not needed just taken out

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.919 
really used not needed just taken out
it's<00:00:51.309> got<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:51.429> real<00:00:51.639> deep<00:00:51.909> concave<00:00:52.569> through<00:00:52.839> the

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
it's got a real deep concave through the

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.389 
it's got a real deep concave through the
middle<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.289> can<00:00:53.409> see<00:00:53.619> that<00:00:53.799> when<00:00:53.979> I<00:00:54.039> lift<00:00:54.249> it

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
