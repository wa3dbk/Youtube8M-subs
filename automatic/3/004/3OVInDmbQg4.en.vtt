00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
replace it well there's a clever little

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.420 
replace it well there's a clever little
couple<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.590> remove<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.369> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
couple here that you remove that and it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
couple here that you remove that and it
takes<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:48.060> section<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.840> seat
