00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.149
 God is the heart of God who will cry for intercession for the next generation. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.530

 Some children actually dominated by the zero volume in a hospital or in a psychiatric hospital more than a building 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:35.080
 Praying will also heal all the sick that are there

 What will guide us to the next generation that we can not concentrate 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 There is the next generation in the heart of your God. 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.370
 There is a generation after that God is the most important of faith through Moses 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.720
 Tell me your strength. 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.700
 Most importantly, listen to the children of Israel, the Lord our God, 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.290
 Jehovah God, with all your heart, with all your mind and with all your might,

 You can see that God breasts 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.869
 Look at England in the 18th century. Messages from around the world. Messages from God to God.

 The country that heard and revived was strong in the Gospel. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.360
 I did with amazing Christianity, but the generation gave it to me. 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 Profuse 1,000,002 know who you serve God

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 There are more and more numbers of people than people. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.410
 I am armed with a puritan groom 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.819
 I taught the Bible outside the axiom. The Christian spirit of all cultures flows. 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
 I went in. 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.030

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.149
 How is it now, church style? But many churches in America have faith 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
 I am. 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.039
 The only remaining contact with his soul as the amount of approximately wake of a major faith in God 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.000
 I'm out. 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.450
 And the three-in-one are breaking down the American church and waving American society 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.440

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.610

 How is the Church of the Republic of Korea were rattling up the next generation, our children jeojeol 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.020

 The next generation and the wonderful four times will just happen. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 If someone does not take it , who does not take it? 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.280
 If you do not tear it, 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.900
 For your next three, not what you dislike is not a waste. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.670
 The greatest call to be called the wisdom of the investment 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.450

 I have time to learn and learn. 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.430
 I still see the benefits of pardon for the teacher. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.450
 There are people. 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.120
