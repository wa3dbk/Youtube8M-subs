where you guys think is in here Lance

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
where you guys think is in here Lance
thinks<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> skateboards<00:01:14.210> Lance<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> wrong

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
thinks of skateboards Lance is wrong

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
thinks of skateboards Lance is wrong
it's<00:01:16.410> magic<00:01:17.010> skateboard<00:01:17.190> wax<00:01:18.080> cool<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.470> these

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's magic skateboard wax cool so these

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.180 
it's magic skateboard wax cool so these
come<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.650> hockey<00:01:22.650> puck

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
come in like these little hockey puck

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.460 
come in like these little hockey puck
shapes<00:01:23.700> looks<00:01:24.390> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.690> like<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> hockey<00:01:25.170> puck

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
shapes looks kind of like a hockey puck

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
shapes looks kind of like a hockey puck
but<00:01:25.770> guess<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.160> it's<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
but guess what it's not this is the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
but guess what it's not this is the
summer<00:01:28.410> formula<00:01:30.050> hmm<00:01:31.140> interesting<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
summer formula hmm interesting so it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
summer formula hmm interesting so it
says<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> front<00:01:33.390> magic<00:01:34.140> skateboard<00:01:34.619> wax

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
says on the front magic skateboard wax

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.390 
says on the front magic skateboard wax
super<00:01:35.970> simple<00:01:36.300> packaging<00:01:36.930> summer<00:01:37.800> formula

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
super simple packaging summer formula

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
super simple packaging summer formula
and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.420> whole<00:01:39.600> deal<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.320> these

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and then the whole deal with these these

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.790 
and then the whole deal with these these
hockey<00:01:41.490> puck<00:01:41.940> waxes<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.440> they're<00:01:43.619> made

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
hockey puck waxes is that they're made

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.820 
hockey puck waxes is that they're made
with<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> hundred<00:01:44.520> percent<00:01:44.910> pure<00:01:45.530> beeswax<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
with a hundred percent pure beeswax and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.639 
with a hundred percent pure beeswax and
it<00:01:46.920> says<00:01:47.100> less<00:01:47.430> melt<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.240> slide<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.320> actually

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it says less melt more slide so actually

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.400 
it says less melt more slide so actually
it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.160> new<00:01:50.940> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.660> skateboard

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
it's just like a new kind of skateboard

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.529 
it's just like a new kind of skateboard
wax<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:54.170> doesn't<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.440> melt<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.190> lot<00:01:56.910> so

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
wax that doesn't really melt a lot so

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.969 
wax that doesn't really melt a lot so
yeah<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.810> whole<00:01:57.990> idea<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
yeah the whole idea with this is that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.310 
yeah the whole idea with this is that
it's<00:01:59.250> able<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.149> withstand<00:02:00.330> really<00:02:01.080> high

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it's able to withstand really high

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's able to withstand really high
temperatures<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.640> whole<00:02:02.940> point<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
temperatures now the whole point of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.969 
temperatures now the whole point of
having<00:02:04.550> smells<00:02:05.550> really<00:02:05.850> good<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.800> whole

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
having smells really good so the whole

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 
having smells really good so the whole
point<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.429> having<00:02:08.780> wax<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.289> withstand

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
point of having wax that can withstand

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.020 
point of having wax that can withstand
really<00:02:10.979> high<00:02:11.160> temperatures<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:11.820> you're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
really high temperatures because you're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.789 
really high temperatures because you're
going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> rub<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.570> wax<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.110> some<00:02:13.290> concrete

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
going to rub this wax on some concrete

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.400 
going to rub this wax on some concrete
and<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.459> want<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.290> you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and you want it to go on there and you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.470 
and you want it to go on there and you
want<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.709> stay<00:02:17.070> there<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.000> melts

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
want it to stay there if it just melts

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500 
want it to stay there if it just melts
and<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:19.049> kind<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> goes<00:02:19.530> away<00:02:19.739> then<00:02:20.670> you're<00:02:21.239> not

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
and it kind of goes away then you're not

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.000 
and it kind of goes away then you're not
really<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> lot<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.739> slide

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
really going to have a lot of slide

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.220 
really going to have a lot of slide
because<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.610> actually<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.230> friction

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
because you actually want friction

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.560 
because you actually want friction
between<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.860> let's<00:02:26.489> say<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
between like let's say here this is a
