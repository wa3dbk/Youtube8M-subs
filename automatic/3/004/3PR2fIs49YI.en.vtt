and no matter who's in or out that's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
and no matter who's in or out that's
what<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:50.990> should<00:02:51.440> be<00:02:51.560> seeing<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.040> ice<00:02:52.160> well

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
what we should be seeing on the ice well

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.310 
what we should be seeing on the ice well
you've<00:02:52.820> talked<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.150> lot<00:02:53.270> about<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.690> similarity

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
you've talked a lot about the similarity

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.350 
you've talked a lot about the similarity
and<00:02:54.410> styles<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.070> symmetry<00:02:55.430> between<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.970> NHL

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and styles that symmetry between the NHL

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.390 
and styles that symmetry between the NHL
and<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> AHL<00:02:57.050> teams<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.950> elaborate<00:02:58.310> on

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
and the AHL teams can you elaborate on

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.530 
and the AHL teams can you elaborate on
that<00:02:58.490> what<00:02:58.790> does<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.060> mean<00:02:59.240> what<00:02:59.390> are<00:02:59.480> they

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
that what does that mean what are they

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.690 
that what does that mean what are they
doing<00:02:59.840> that's<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.560> similar<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.100> helps<00:03:01.580> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
doing that's so similar that helps a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
doing that's so similar that helps a
player<00:03:01.880> come<00:03:02.150> up<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> NHL<00:03:02.840> level<00:03:02.930> so

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
player come up to the NHL level so

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.050 
player come up to the NHL level so
easily<00:03:03.580> one<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> things<00:03:04.880> that's

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
easily one of the things that's

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.550 
easily one of the things that's
difficult<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.690> what<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.990> call<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.320> getting

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
difficult to what you call up getting

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.230 
difficult to what you call up getting
your<00:03:06.680> first<00:03:06.830> game<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.400> trying<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.910> show<00:03:08.120> what

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
your first game and trying to show what

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240 
your first game and trying to show what
you<00:03:08.300> can<00:03:08.330> do<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.780> need<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.410> adjust<00:03:09.530> teammates

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you can do is need to adjust teammates
