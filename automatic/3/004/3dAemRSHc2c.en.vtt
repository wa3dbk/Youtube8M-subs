00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
memory it's another glitch fest it's

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.520 
memory it's another glitch fest it's
just<00:00:07.980> located<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.700> by<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.300> fly-in<00:00:09.929> point<00:00:10.290> by

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
just located here by a fly-in point by

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.870 
just located here by a fly-in point by
Harbormaster<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.519> get<00:00:11.639> pretty<00:00:11.759> close

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Harbormaster so you can get pretty close

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.919 
Harbormaster so you can get pretty close
and<00:00:13.099> I<00:00:14.099> had<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.460> run<00:00:14.639> around<00:00:14.759> forever<00:00:15.509> looking

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and I had to run around forever looking

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.630 
and I had to run around forever looking
for<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.470> there's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> big<00:00:16.830> old<00:00:17.010> sign<00:00:17.310> on

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
for this but there's a big old sign on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.240 
for this but there's a big old sign on
the<00:00:17.880> building<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.270> says<00:00:18.449> brewery<00:00:19.250> anyway

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the building that says brewery anyway

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.769 
the building that says brewery anyway
make<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.609> way<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> icon<00:00:21.600> will

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
make your way in and the icon will

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
make your way in and the icon will
appear<00:00:21.840> which<00:00:22.320> probably<00:00:22.590> means<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.220> was

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
appear which probably means that it was

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.470 
appear which probably means that it was
supposed<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> appear<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:23.970> along<00:00:24.240> but

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
supposed to appear all along but

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.050 
supposed to appear all along but
whatever<00:00:25.189> stopped<00:00:26.189> tournament<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> you've

whatever stopped tournament and you've
got<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.539> four<00:00:27.960> fights<00:00:28.289> first<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.130> against

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
got I think four fights first is against

got I think four fights first is against
a<00:00:29.490> Redcoat<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.179> he's<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> big<00:00:30.900> guy<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a Redcoat and he's the big guy so you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
a Redcoat and he's the big guy so you
can<00:00:31.710> chain<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.730> these<00:00:32.940> little<00:00:33.180> guys<00:00:33.420> pretty

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
can chain all these little guys pretty

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
can chain all these little guys pretty
easily<00:00:34.170> wait<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.829> hit<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.850> an

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
easily wait for one of them to hit do an

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
easily wait for one of them to hit do an
attack<00:00:36.239> counter<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.230> them

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
attack counter and then just take them

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
attack counter and then just take them
all<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> red

all down and then it's on to the red
coat<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> dealt<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.590> these

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.080 
coat and the way I dealt with all these
guys<00:00:40.950> they're<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.219> susceptible<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
guys they're all susceptible to it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
guys they're all susceptible to it
there's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> counter<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> disarm<00:00:43.680> which

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there's a counter then a disarm which

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.590 
there's a counter then a disarm which
will<00:00:44.370> turn<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.700> around<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.270> punch

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
will turn them around and then punch

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139 
will turn them around and then punch
them<00:00:45.719> around<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.579> then<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> guy<00:00:47.879> seemed

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
them around a bit then this guy seemed

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
them around a bit then this guy seemed
to<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.360> quite<00:00:48.570> interesting<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.739> it's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to be quite interesting because it's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.170 
to be quite interesting because it's
easy<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.399> him<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
easy get him down to a little bit of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.779 
easy get him down to a little bit of
health<00:00:51.420> dude<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> Williams<00:00:53.430> hands<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
health dude in the Williams hands and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.600 
health dude in the Williams hands and
sword<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> pushes<00:00:54.809> him<00:00:54.899> back<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> again

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sword and pushes him back in so again

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
sword and pushes him back in so again
countered<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> arm<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> get<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> sword<00:00:57.989> out

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
countered this arm to get the sword out

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
countered this arm to get the sword out
of<00:00:58.140> his<00:00:58.230> hand<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.640> thought<00:00:59.850> about<00:00:59.969> picking

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
of his hand and I thought about picking

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.610 
of his hand and I thought about picking
the<00:01:00.329> sword<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> figured<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.500> would

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the sword up but then I figured it would

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
the sword up but then I figured it would
just<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> sink<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.460> killing<00:01:02.850> him<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.539> would

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just be sink for killing him which would

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
just be sink for killing him which would
be<00:01:03.780> pretty<00:01:03.989> tedious<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> again<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.150> finish

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
be pretty tedious so again I just finish

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.039 
be pretty tedious so again I just finish
him<00:01:06.689> off

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
him off

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.920 
him off
wait<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.770> him<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> attack<00:01:08.310> counter<00:01:09.090> disarmed

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
wait for him to attack counter disarmed

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
wait for him to attack counter disarmed
and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.950> punch<00:01:11.220> him<00:01:11.369> around<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.180> he

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and then punch him around it then he

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.289 
and then punch him around it then he
goes<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:12.810> quickly<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> next<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
goes down pretty quickly the next one is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.440 
goes down pretty quickly the next one is
the<00:01:15.479> blocker<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.250> twist<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the blocker and in this one the twist is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.820 
the blocker and in this one the twist is
that<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.140> close<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> crowd

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that if you get too close to the crowd

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280 
that if you get too close to the crowd
they'll<00:01:20.100> start<00:01:20.340> punching<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.720> counter
