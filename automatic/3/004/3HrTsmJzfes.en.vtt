this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.860> my<00:00:11.010> leopard<00:00:11.340> gecko<00:00:11.610> mini<00:00:11.849> she<00:00:12.420> was

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
this is my leopard gecko mini she was

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
this is my leopard gecko mini she was
born<00:00:12.719> with<00:00:12.900> an<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.200> words<00:00:13.440> eyelid

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
born with an in words eyelid

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.760 
born with an in words eyelid
her<00:00:14.670> eyeball<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.179> also<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.809> slight<00:00:16.320> angle

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
her eyeball is also at slight angle

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.230 
her eyeball is also at slight angle
which<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> problem<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:17.850> she<00:00:18.000> tries<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
which can be a problem when she tries to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.269 
which can be a problem when she tries to
determine<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.350> distance<00:00:19.740> between<00:00:19.980> herself

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
determine the distance between herself

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880 
determine the distance between herself
and<00:00:20.640> her<00:00:20.820> prey<00:00:21.119> however<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.470> overcome

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and her prey however we have overcome

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.490 
and her prey however we have overcome
this<00:00:23.010> problem

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:41.450 

or<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.560> use<00:00:30.039> is<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.340> white<00:00:30.730> plastic<00:00:31.359> spoon

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.340 

you<00:00:42.460> should<00:00:42.640> try<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.910> mimic<00:00:43.240> the<00:00:43.720> movements<00:00:44.230> of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
you should try to mimic the movements of

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.320 
you should try to mimic the movements of
the<00:00:44.530> cricket<00:00:44.950> making<00:00:45.700> a<00:00:45.760> little<00:00:45.970> bit<00:00:46.060> of<00:00:46.120> sound

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
the cricket making a little bit of sound

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.720 
the cricket making a little bit of sound
in<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.630> dirt<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.980> shuffling<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.520> little

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
in the dirt and to shuffling a little

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.730 
in the dirt and to shuffling a little
bit<00:00:48.850> but<00:00:48.970> not<00:00:49.180> too<00:00:49.240> much<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.380> they're<00:00:50.560> getting

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
bit but not too much so they're getting

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.500 
bit but not too much so they're getting
a<00:00:51.130> chance<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.900> see<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.110> cricket<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.710> aim<00:00:54.510> what

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
a chance to see the cricket and aim what

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.420 
a chance to see the cricket and aim what
she<00:00:55.660> does<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.140> she<00:00:56.170> aims<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.830> handle<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.400> the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
she does is she aims the handle of the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.479 
she does is she aims the handle of the
spoon<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.559> she<00:00:59.710> can't<00:00:59.980> calculate

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
spoon and because she can't calculate

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.420 
spoon and because she can't calculate
distance<00:01:00.940> correctly<00:01:01.420> she'll<00:01:02.190> normally<00:01:03.190> bites

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
distance correctly she'll normally bites

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.390 
distance correctly she'll normally bites
make<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:03.970> before<00:01:04.270> the<00:01:04.420> spoon<00:01:04.950> which<00:01:05.950> happens

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
make just before the spoon which happens

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.420 
make just before the spoon which happens
to<00:01:06.490> be<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> cricket

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.010 

as<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.640> can<00:01:12.760> see<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.180> doesn't<00:01:13.330> always<00:01:13.630> work

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
as you can see it doesn't always work

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.770 
as you can see it doesn't always work
out<00:01:14.260> as<00:01:14.410> planned

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:29.540 

we'll<00:01:18.620> try<00:01:19.310> again<00:01:19.960> hopefully<00:01:20.960> be<00:01:21.380> successful

and<00:01:35.730> she<00:01:35.940> has<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.380> take<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.770> while

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and she has it now this can take a while

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580

them leave five about five of these at
time<00:01:47.660> obviously<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.930> takes<00:01:49.080> some<00:01:49.320> time<00:01:49.350> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
time obviously it takes some time but

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.040 
time obviously it takes some time but
it's<00:01:50.040> worth
