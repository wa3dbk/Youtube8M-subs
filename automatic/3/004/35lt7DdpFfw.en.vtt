00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.720
 See you again today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:14.280
 minecraft pocket edition show 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:20.550
 who sees is 4 15 30 18 5 1 against her 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:28.039
 There are three may each with 36 times 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.039
 the world and therefore are a people must 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.290
 then fly on more 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:49.829
 somehow here already the first village she 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:01:01.219
 straight constituting the gate of mike smith 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:06.589
 the different a church and just ok 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.589
 now something in the exchange period 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.360
 two gold two gold two oxidize and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.909
 So my passion is already 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.259
 Not that bad, but okay 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.720
 here are two other villages there with two 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.900
 co-workers blacksmith and build here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.140
 they even take to the first 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:38.119
 and then the second is looking now 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.119
 first in the box of the first golf 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.600
 He was a travel coach of Katrin Detzel 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 iron obsidian bread and ink sacks 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.740
 So she has already seen one should 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.560
 not in sandstone in view is the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.450
 then break down comes in and then burns 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.990
 probably could be the iron needs 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:35.410
 panzer burns and now is there 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:39.490
 the last one is traveling four breads 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.040
 and 13 6 ok and that's it 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.100
 really with this video so really 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.750
 Three blake are really pretty good 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.850
 crates of cast iron tanks that one 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.880
 So sword made a weapon and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 retrofit 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.660
 So I think this counts on everyone 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.310
 case really cool 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.260
 and if you liked the video 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.380
 Of course I would like to have one 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.459
 review and then we'll see each other 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.459
