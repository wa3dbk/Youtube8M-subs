00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.700
 GDR 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.700
 Herre 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.229
 Dr 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:14.819
 the kilns should be sharper 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.299
 May be a driven 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.099
 or the 4 1 million 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.099
 I see all the apparatus in that 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.780
 I want countless things that we only have this opportunity to use 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.220
 a long try you have to tell me how you made it ours 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 Jury member Alexander 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.600
 the big coup last 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.860
 I was AR 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 And now they are guaranteed to entertain 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.960
 this website 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.690
 really exciting will be whether everything does not help 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.060
 maybe they are not tying themselves 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.290
 "We go gently that the performance can be different 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.290
 reluctant in such a high v 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 so will 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 Künast 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.650
 Elia Erhart 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 German champion becomes 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.640
 Prince 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.630
 if the weather from the previous day 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.270
 that a woman's bag so you can kiss this and modernize 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.550
 the idea 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.470
 I 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.510
 I already see that for myself today 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 just for me 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.550
 Minute and Ji 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 the clou old 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.960
 she reached the third place of the German charts 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.080
 How far is the University of Münster? 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 after the solo effort 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 our houses 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.589
 a change is 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.749
 run 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.709
 because if there have always been 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.779
 get a year 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.889
 crazy this year 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.430
 we may have life but also strictest criteria 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.449
 at all, the text is not 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.319
 So I do not know what do you think 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.659
 ruled with a mixture of 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.989
 the taz is not called yet it is super way 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.829
 but he did not succeed 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.889
 finally enjoy 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.639
 the exclusively 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.639
 for one like a unit 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.119
 but it is clear that it is not quite as disturbing on the piano 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.129
 it is not darker yet 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.129
 Tatort in a double pack 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.679
 meets the tests 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.899
 all band members twice in one place
