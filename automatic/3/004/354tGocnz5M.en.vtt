00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.930
 under the rain 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.020
 like 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 4 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 Hello everyone 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.989
 how are you going to end up 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 today for a new video on 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 is on call of duty black ops 2 we are 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.509
 still on chuck is true that at each 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.530
 once I launch a solid game 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.130
 I welcome and I'm trying 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 save 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 well, it falls very very very often 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 on the jackets good ben it's not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 serious because I'm getting used to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.119
 in stoneham and I think it concerns 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 the favorite brand even yield small even 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 if it does not match it is because 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.080
 force to see her ben I find one 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 used to play on it so here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 so we are in qemu mode and stick I 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.440
 do not know if I already said my mode 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.649
 favorite on the block gets and then the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.509
 Cairo as a black ops injury 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.970
 even if I find that in the black ops 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 from there - the commando we had in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.920
 the black ops 1 is still not bad 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.210
 make his strength people a little better 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.710
 played but that we do not have too many 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.610
 difference the commando is still 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 present 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.299
 sometimes but I find it is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.729
 less present than on the Pacific in 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.350
 the 1 the commanders he was really doing 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.310
 very often to tell myself that I am 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.409
 very agile with all rather in the 1 2 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.570
 jacobus two dogs little less agile and 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.009
 that's the screen and then especially at m 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.530
 it's been a while I have not played on 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.270
 black ops so we'll say the lack 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.840
 the lack of habit is felt 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.150
 that's it then you'll see I'm going to be 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.110
 the player if I'm not mistaken who suffered 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 the most route so I downstairs to 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.760
 right special tears that you have in 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.140
 the pebble and stick but that you can 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.760
 also find in online mode in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.160
 every mode I think if I'm wrong 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 except maybe in the matches is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.680
 that of a brief the special matches and 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.959
 then also if there must be someone 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 some modes where we do not have it 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.099
 a blame and I think that overall 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.920
 the tomahawk is available but in any case 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.230
 but are we going to demand that then 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.390
 I made them pretty that this 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.590
 with the crossbow and the post but 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.510
 have to say I'm really a lot 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.940
 more gifted at knife than it is at 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.650
 distance to melee I am 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.940
 much more play with the knife that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.050
 with the ride not say that I am talented 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.960
 like a pro 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.630
 are we going to say that I already 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.400
 I can manage a little better with 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.930
 the knife with the ball is so 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.880
 so here I am going to chain the double 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.140
 murder I will see also succeed a step 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.010
 badly to the not bad to the fact frankly he 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.900
 must say in melee I have when 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 not very bad and especially when 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 we take a tomahawk in the face 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.340
 I assure you that shit is 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.320
 really an ultimate stage it's I think 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.760
 the tomahawk there something that is 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.710
 dense in this mode but at the same time 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.880
 it serves us a lot when we are 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.790
 last the last time you got it 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.640
 seen in my live complaints like that one 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.570
 was on the map 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.310
 we are not on which maps 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:45.370
 remember I had finished first in 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.980
 more and I was really happy I 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.030
 I have rather macabre but any 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.980
 way it's available 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.290
 it's available on my channel you 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.280
 can go see and we go there 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.380
 Frankly I was very happy 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.450
 of amendments or to this day especially 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.640
 that I was not used to the man of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.930
 send it 1 and I do not have much 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.140
 sent from elsewhere in the part I 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.030
 fauchon sent a force and bah I 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.830
 hit but my two opponents even though 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.880
 of times I sent them and I 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.920
 send it in the wind I mean 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.680
 in fact it's like I'm going 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.630
 knowing that I do not want to see who there 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.950
 so I do not know if on screen 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.790
 I may be synchronized by this 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.060
 meaning that I still have problems 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.800
 recording my video to small 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.800
 slats shots she slows down on 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.510
 will say recording a little bit 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.270
 bad for me but I always arrive 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.360
 to comment anyway while waiting 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.160
 what I meant was that in fact 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.480
 at home if they have you if you saw him at 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.300
 the screen of the coup is past then 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.010
 French spoken too much I did two 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.960
 wonderful shot in the head luz had to 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.790
 go on screen but not frankly 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.990
 it was frankly it's pretty 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.790
 so I wanted to talk to you about it all 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.310
 just froze not go over 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.820
 that but I find that frankly for 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.580
 a way 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.510
 after having to be back on this mode 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.250
 and it's been a while since I 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.810
 did not play I think but I 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.860
 makes a good score you will see with 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.180
 what place did I finish you? 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.030
 do not reveal now I do you 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.840
 lower the suspense until the end and 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.330
 so here is the next video then 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.120
 there we are on call of duty game which I 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.570
 you let pardon a battlefield 3 this 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 morning finally for me this morning I was 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.590
 on battlefield 3 but I think you 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.910
