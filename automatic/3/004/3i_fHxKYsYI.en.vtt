we<00:02:46.220> used<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.640> es<00:02:46.909> files<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.510> include<00:02:47.629> data

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
we used a es files that include data

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.100 
we used a es files that include data
regarding<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.830> area<00:02:49.099> shape<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:50.690> can<00:02:50.870> see

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
regarding the area shape as you can see

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.809 
regarding the area shape as you can see
the<00:02:51.349> shape<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.830> light<00:02:51.980> source<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.340> visible

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the shape of the light source is visible

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.140 
the shape of the light source is visible
in<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> render<00:02:53.150> image<00:02:54.700> please<00:02:55.700> note<00:02:55.970> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
in the render image please note this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.880 
in the render image please note this
additional<00:02:56.599> data<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.959> enables<00:02:57.260> showing<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
additional data that enables showing the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.130 
additional data that enables showing the
area<00:02:58.159> shape<00:02:58.489> is<00:02:58.700> rarely<00:02:59.030> embedded<00:02:59.569> in<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.780> IES

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
area shape is rarely embedded in the IES

let's<00:03:02.480> try<00:03:02.720> one<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.110> IES<00:03:03.470> lights<00:03:03.739> from<00:03:04.010> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
let's try one of the IES lights from the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.390 
let's try one of the IES lights from the
previous<00:03:04.489> example<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:06.739> will<00:03:06.890> use<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.069> one<00:03:07.370> on

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
previous example we will use the one on

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.949 
previous example we will use the one on
the<00:03:07.610> right<00:03:07.819> wall<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.269> a<00:03:08.330> real-life<00:03:08.510> project<00:03:10.959> we

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the right wall in a real-life project we

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.080 
the right wall in a real-life project we
already<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> few<00:03:12.860> IES<00:03:13.340> lights<00:03:13.579> prepared

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
already have a few IES lights prepared

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.509 
already have a few IES lights prepared
with<00:03:14.269> default<00:03:14.629> settings<00:03:15.040> but<00:03:16.040> first<00:03:16.280> let's

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
with default settings but first let's

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.710 
with default settings but first let's
take<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.760> look<00:03:16.879> at<00:03:17.120> what<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.360> rendered<00:03:17.660> image

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
take a look at what the rendered image

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
take a look at what the rendered image
of<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.110> house<00:03:18.290> looks<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:18.860> without<00:03:19.430> IES

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
of the house looks like without IES

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.730 
of the house looks like without IES
lights

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.199 

now<00:03:26.740> let's<00:03:27.069> see<00:03:27.250> how<00:03:27.370> they<00:03:27.520> contribute<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
now let's see how they contribute to the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.150 
now let's see how they contribute to the
scene<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:28.660> turned<00:03:28.900> on

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.240 

the<00:03:34.120> IES<00:03:34.570> lights<00:03:34.870> are<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.140> bit<00:03:35.350> high<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.980> we<00:03:36.100> will

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
the IES lights are a bit high so we will

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.190 
the IES lights are a bit high so we will
have<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.520> lower<00:03:36.670> them<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.630> general<00:03:38.020> we<00:03:38.170> can

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
have to lower them but in general we can

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.230 
have to lower them but in general we can
say<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.740> use<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:38.920> IES<00:03:39.460> lights<00:03:39.700> have<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> great

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
say the use of IES lights have a great

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.120 
say the use of IES lights have a great
impact<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.750> realism<00:03:41.140> when<00:03:41.680> rendering<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
impact on realism when rendering a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.610 
impact on realism when rendering a
project
