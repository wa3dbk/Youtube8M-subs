and it's just a really nice scrub I keep
this<00:01:55.840> one<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.259> my<00:01:56.469> shower<00:01:56.740> because<00:01:57.399> it's<00:01:57.670> so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
this one in my shower because it's so

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.999 
this one in my shower because it's so
it's<00:01:58.179> full<00:01:58.420> leading<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.469> don't<00:01:59.649> know<00:01:59.770> if<00:01:59.920> I

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
it's full leading you don't know if I

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.949

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.790 
clogged and you want a really cleanse it
kind<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.429> thing<00:02:09.729> because<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.410> chock

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
kind of thing because it is so chock

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.030 
kind of thing because it is so chock
full<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.100> like<00:02:12.430> little<00:02:12.790> milling<00:02:13.300> beads<00:02:13.540> I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
full of like little milling beads I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.140 
full of like little milling beads I
think<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.129> would<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> little<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.760> too<00:02:15.939> rough

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
think it would be a little bit too rough

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.760 
think it would be a little bit too rough
to<00:02:16.390> use

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
to use

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860 
to use
every<00:02:16.950> single<00:02:17.310> day<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.240> same<00:02:18.450> time<00:02:18.690> I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
every single day but at the same time I

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
every single day but at the same time I
have<00:02:18.960> really<00:02:19.230> sensitive<00:02:19.410> skin<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.820> think

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have really sensitive skin so I think

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.190 
have really sensitive skin so I think
it's<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:22.140> good<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.190> doesn't

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it's really good because it doesn't

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.010
