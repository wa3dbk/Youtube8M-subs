00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello my dear visitors 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.430
 channel today we have Dubna to please 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.570
 food construction work completed 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.170
 we are heating the first test duct 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.219
 barbecue 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:22.550
 smoke does not go in the eyes and let's look 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:26.930
 here is this bunch at the same time with us 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.050
 The kazan works should notice that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.010
 our smoke box is still raw only 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.950
 Today I took a temporary 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:44.140
 let's say the film cover 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.140
 there is an old directory with which 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:54.530
 managed to prevent the whole stove from falling 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 in films but the tube is folded here a little bit 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 and gerdy this stuff 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.670
 what we close and you will leave the pipe 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.439
 there is no house here it is just 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.590
 abnormal combustion furnace firebox mode 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.139
 must be closed ie two 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.060
 devices at the same time let's get a little 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.060
 walk and see them hard 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 and on the other comes 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 but in the video tutorial we will see 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.590
 let's go here so maybe there will be 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.020
 it is visible but with channel 2 stomach said by the way 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.929
 just flax visually goes smoke from the brazier 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.850
 not really gonna be good burning like this 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.330
 so we built built and finally 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330
 built 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.549
