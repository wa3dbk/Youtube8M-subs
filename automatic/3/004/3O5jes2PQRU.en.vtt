00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.399
 Well, anyway, and it was definitely over and it was over 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.670
 Holes through the mountains and percent of the right heights 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.840
 is there and silent the inflammation, she fired a perfect example 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.130
 very easily 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.060
 something is now clear 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.270
 and I think that's for sure it really is for you 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.790
 «Really cool» 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.790
 Monastery and the whole monster and such by hand 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.220

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.870
 Skype should 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.270
 a disadvantage 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.250
 it's a little Osamas partner 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.420
 BZ works 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 by a good percent and let me just tell you what a living Daimler sees 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 So Olympics single-player Profilbildung 2 0 Sampdoria now apparently 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.900
 worked out of fear climbs wonders works 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.320
 that she is not 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.870
 and rub Peter now 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
 8 so the LP can be 6 and 6 degrees 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.120
 and it seems certain that women from their point of view the name day to the 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.150
 Eppinger not detailed and I did not remember when I did that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.400
 last of them so prominently and I just have it there 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.619
 both in Newmarket 6 6 made it behind and it came out 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.430
 I do not know now in the long run also worked only 6 6 percent on 6 6 6 1 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.110
 Picture APA Well 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 Top topic so it belongs to life around a year 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.910
 if she works here again consistently be sure 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.490
 it has always worked for us so the CEBS work this time so I leave 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.490
 never be picked up 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.039
 to Munich 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:26.559
 That's why I have a hotspot Kicktipp ex-profi with Clinton's landline 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.309
 if I change something 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.739
 come on 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 "I do not want to be arrogant 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.599
 Euro sent Klier the clubs reasonably so their highs and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.539
 deep hatred 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.279
 I drove the Kerpener 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
 he does so, so to speak 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.559
 percent 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.489
 So who sits so do not understand why a perfect example but you can see 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.499
 Berlin again 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.779
 Stucki he's already a lot of Berger again 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:18.109
 you can build a hut as well as popcorn so there is really every one 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.439
 So with me it has worked out every time so far and so am I. 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.469
 Set percent happy 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.229
 and it looks really disappointing 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.549
 would not accept that 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.290
 we represent our kind is you can actually look at the company and that is 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.249
 for me very differently interested 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:42.649
 you just have to try all the levels sitting in the back so to 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:47.059
 Example Bayer and have a life with Alina Pay the operator so I know 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.709
 not it and as Mike b 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.079
 Knops enter or so why Gomez claim or telephone what 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.379
 I know everything if possible and then you could see what 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.119
 it comes out but man always tries us again and again 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.169
 it's the same all over the tournament 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.219
 but Inter is certainly that's down she accepts 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.539
 But I also do not always understand homes if there are so many 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.909
 that we have such a great solution of great control and a mountain 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.279
 appears on the 5 transversely refer to the Ramona Pop briefly 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:26.199

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.879
 to miss them 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.470

 Dr okay and make some money 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.659
 It was a little bit about him 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.740
 Start of the presentation Euro, so to speak, that something could happen 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.539
 In addition, several sees that comes perhaps more countries goal to erturnen 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.840
 seems all in the comments purely 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.219
 the municipalities are and he still seems so out of the prospects 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:02.029
 her hair and then around when I have a lot of fun with this Iz go to Heirs 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.650
 Euro 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.110
 There, right out of the nice of the Soviet, or whether I have these days 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.089
 sda 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.289
 above the clouds 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.789
