truer than the last one Crudup the wheel

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.659 
truer than the last one Crudup the wheel
somewhat<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:30.050> gotta<00:00:31.219> start<00:00:32.219> working<00:00:32.399> on

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
somewhat as well gotta start working on

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.299 
somewhat as well gotta start working on
the<00:00:32.820> steer<00:00:33.000> part<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:34.070> don't<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the steer part of it I don't know if I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
the steer part of it I don't know if I
mentioned<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.750> gonna

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
mentioned it before or not but I'm gonna

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
mentioned it before or not but I'm gonna
put<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> shoot<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
put a shoot in the top and one off to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.770 
put a shoot in the top and one off to
the<00:00:39.870> side<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.090> I'll<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> little

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the side and then I'll put the little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.520 
the side and then I'll put the little
splitter<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:44.480> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> left-hand<00:00:46.020> side

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.619 

yeah<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.309> piece<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> plan<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
yeah that's a piece that's the plan for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
yeah that's a piece that's the plan for
now<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> beginnings<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
now so that's the beginnings of it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.150 
now so that's the beginnings of it
that'll<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> back<00:00:54.000> man<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:55.129> make<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that'll be the back man and make a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
that'll be the back man and make a
fairly<00:00:56.550> large<00:00:56.969> chute<00:00:59.149> probably<00:01:00.149> five<00:01:00.660> across

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
fairly large chute probably five across

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.030 
fairly large chute probably five across
by<00:01:01.680> roughly<00:01:02.489> ten<00:01:02.760> it'll<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.780> time<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.260> put

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
by roughly ten it'll be this time to put

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
by roughly ten it'll be this time to put
two<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.400> together<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.330> I'll<00:01:09.619> have

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
two of these together and then I'll have

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.270 
two of these together and then I'll have
that<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.650> an<00:01:16.740> insert<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that up here and I can put an insert in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.710 
that up here and I can put an insert in
and<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> smaller<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and to make it smaller if I need it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.039 
and to make it smaller if I need it
which<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> won't<00:01:19.259> likely<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
which I won't likely have to do and I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
which I won't likely have to do and I
can<00:01:22.380> vary<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> size<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> wood<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
can vary the size of the wood and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.859 
can vary the size of the wood and
hopefully<00:01:25.790> let<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> feed<00:01:27.150> itself<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
hopefully let it feed itself for the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
hopefully let it feed itself for the
most<00:01:28.080> part<00:01:30.380> he<00:01:36.650> they<00:01:37.650> engage<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.490> engage

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
most part he they engage just engage

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.950 
most part he they engage just engage
gadget<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> second

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
gadget here this will be the second

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
gadget here this will be the second
lever<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:44.100> gonna<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.549> got<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lever

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
lever it's not I'm gonna put got a lever

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
lever it's not I'm gonna put got a lever
here<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.420> lever<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:49.200> come<00:01:49.740> off

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
here and then this lever will come off

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
here and then this lever will come off
the<00:01:50.040> other<00:01:50.159> side<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.000> makeshift

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the other side this is just makeshift

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
the other side this is just makeshift
then<00:01:51.750> lift<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:56.369> hard<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.030> with

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
then lift it up really hard to do with

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.200 
then lift it up really hard to do with
one<00:01:57.780> hand<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.610> specifically<00:01:59.610> why<00:01:59.969> I'm

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
one hand and that's specifically why I'm

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
one hand and that's specifically why I'm
doing<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.719> way<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.960> can't<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
doing it this way you can't have it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600 
doing it this way you can't have it
engage<00:02:02.250> accidentally<00:02:03.380> so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:17.460 

just<00:02:06.970> kind<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.330> wiggle<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.870> out<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.289> there<00:02:16.470> so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
just kind of wiggle that out of there so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 
just kind of wiggle that out of there so
you<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:17.650> focus<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.820> hand<00:02:19.060> will<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.300> in

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
you get focus then my hand will get in

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.730 
you get focus then my hand will get in
the<00:02:19.450> picture<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> camera<00:02:20.320> oil<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the picture and on the camera oil to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.820 
the picture and on the camera oil to
focus<00:02:21.070> again<00:02:21.300> 20<00:02:22.300> rate<00:02:22.510> that's<00:02:23.080> engaged<00:02:24.750> okay

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
focus again 20 rate that's engaged okay

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.660 
focus again 20 rate that's engaged okay
so<00:02:26.830> if<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.220> push<00:02:27.730> down<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:30.100> locks<00:02:30.460> very

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
so if I push down on that it locks very

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.840 
so if I push down on that it locks very
positively<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.870> will<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:34.050> green<00:02:35.050> ages<00:02:35.850> that's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
positively it will not green ages that's

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.250 
positively it will not green ages that's
that<00:02:37.480> right

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.229 

so<00:02:41.250> what<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.819> do<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:44.580> put<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.060> other

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
so what I have to do is put the other

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.930 
so what I have to do is put the other
lever<00:02:47.120> flips<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.890> then<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.040> sets<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.449 

that<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.870> even<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.409> do<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.220> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
that way but even if I do it that way I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.280 
that way but even if I do it that way I
don't<00:02:58.129> know<00:02:59.129> if<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.400> could<00:02:59.549> do<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.790> with<00:03:00.290> one

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
don't know if I could do this with one

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.220 
don't know if I could do this with one
hand<00:03:01.319> or<00:03:01.830> not<00:03:01.980> okay<00:03:02.819> push<00:03:03.569> down<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
hand or not okay push down with that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.850 
then I have to lift that I have to
disengage<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.420> very<00:03:09.900> deliberate

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
disengage it so it's a very deliberate

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.330 
disengage it so it's a very deliberate
action<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:13.110> went<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.160> had

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
action and I went to this because I had

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.660 
action and I went to this because I had
a<00:03:14.370> couple<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:16.160> interesting<00:03:17.160> situations<00:03:18.120> where

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
a couple of interesting situations where

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.400 
a couple of interesting situations where
the<00:03:20.670> rubber<00:03:20.970> wheel<00:03:21.150> took<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.690> upon<00:03:21.959> itself<00:03:21.989> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
the rubber wheel took it upon itself to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.009 
the rubber wheel took it upon itself to
engage<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.700> wasn't<00:03:24.090> quite<00:03:24.299> ready<00:03:24.540> for<00:03:24.720> it

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
engage and I wasn't quite ready for it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.400 
engage and I wasn't quite ready for it
now<00:03:25.790> nothing<00:03:26.790> bad<00:03:27.030> happened<00:03:27.569> but<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> sure

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
pointed to just some potential for some

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.479 
pointed to just some potential for some
