it's a one millimeter I'll just have a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.309 
it's a one millimeter I'll just have a
quick<00:03:03.590> look<00:03:04.010> oh<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.359> zero<00:03:05.569> point<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.870> it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
just got the basic kit an example as you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.599 
just got the basic kit an example as you
can<00:04:17.100> see<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.820> see<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.000> model<00:04:18.479> number

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
can see if you see the model number

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.940 
can see if you see the model number
don't<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.700> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:21.030> see<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.359> K<00:04:21.750> X<00:04:21.930> 0<00:04:22.710> 1

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
don't know if you can see that K X 0 1

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.480 
don't know if you can see that K X 0 1
901<00:04:23.669> ta<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.660> 1<00:04:24.930> ta<00:04:25.229> means<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.370> has

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
901 ta the 1 ta means that it has

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.300 
901 ta the 1 ta means that it has
everything<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.210> SC<00:04:27.600> version<00:04:28.050> has<00:04:28.229> AC<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.250> it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
everything the SC version has AC so it

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.570 
everything the SC version has AC so it
has<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.240> can<00:04:30.419> see<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.200> in<00:04:31.320> there<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
has like you can see that in there you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.070 
has like you can see that in there you
can<00:04:32.760> just<00:04:32.880> see<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.360> bit<00:04:33.630> just<00:04:33.900> in

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
can just see the little bit just in

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.770 
can just see the little bit just in
there<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:35.010> has<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.340> black<00:04:35.610> metal<00:04:35.910> color<00:04:36.330> for

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
there it has the black metal color for

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.830 
there it has the black metal color for
the<00:04:36.900> main<00:04:37.590> gear<00:04:37.950> example<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.910> does<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.270> think<00:04:39.630> it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the main gear example it does I think it

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.950 
the main gear example it does I think it
has<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.020> blade<00:04:40.350> grip<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.800> I'm<00:04:40.860> not<00:04:41.010> too<00:04:41.310> sure

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
has the blade grip so I'm not too sure

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.909 
has the blade grip so I'm not too sure
 just<00:04:43.169> put<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.500> there<00:04:43.620> I'm<00:04:43.710> not<00:04:43.860> sure

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
 just put it there I'm not sure

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.580 
 just put it there I'm not sure
that<00:04:45.380> then<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.530> has<00:04:46.740> oh<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:48.630> came<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.139> SP

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590
