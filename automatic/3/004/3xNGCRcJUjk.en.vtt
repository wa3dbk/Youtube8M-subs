00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.070
 to Nîmes must recover from his faux pas 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.439
 on his lawn defeat 1 0 against the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.790
 haven during the previous day the 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.420
 Nimes are sixth and still believe 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.590
 in a possible rise in league 1 it is 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.350
 moves on the lawn of arles-avignon 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.820
 17th 3 points forward on the red zone 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.890
 arles-avignon would be well inspired by 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.600
 win this game at home 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.150
 avignon arles who plays this sense to 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.489
 habous hanging without looking and that 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.949
 roll misses the call for nîmes he 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.470
 must evolve without paroxix haddou and ab 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.480
 or the Nîmes players who are the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.520
 first to get an opportunity 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 this balloon in the penalty area 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.360
 for benezet has set back 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.000
 this sudden hit is countered and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.700
 can be touched with one hand and this is the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 case for referee cédric cotrel 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.870
 means the penalty spot 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.210
 the decision was quick to make for 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.340
 the referee and after a quarter of an hour 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 in this match 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.700
 Nimes must be able to benefit from a 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.979
 golden opportunity to open the scoring 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 a very unfortunate hand is yours 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.100
 long-term one hand all the same in the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.500
 surface to repair 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.149
 it's the best scorer in Nimes who gets 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.789
 present to hit this vincent penalty 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.289
 gragnic will try his luck and that's 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.959
 successful 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.720
 opener for nîmes 14th goal 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.000
 of the season for gragnic and 1 0 for 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.039
 the crocos outside the reaction 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.300
 Fast arles avignon before the half 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.280
 hour of play with this long balloon in 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.550
 depth and the missed exit from 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.819
 cyrille merville the goalkeeper of 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.929
 Nimes comes crashing into an opponent and the 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:58.030
 referee will take out the red card against 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.030
 the goalkeeper a dangerous move on 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.540
 this exit 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.670
 red card that seems logical enough 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.770
 problem the Nimes have no plans to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.750
 replacing guardian is the choice of 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.540
 victor viktor and so it's a middle 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.490
 of land mohamed benyahia who will 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.510
 have to play for an hour as 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.270
 that goalkeeper 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 it's a golden opportunity to come back for 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.240
 arles avignon to eleven against ten and with 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.340
 a field player in the goal nîmois the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.340
 free kick that follows gives nothing 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.640
 but arles avignon will surely have 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.210
 still a lot of opportunities in this 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.400
 match with this new possibility of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.350
 center the ball is not very good 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.460
 released this shot that goes over 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.890
 crossbar 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.710
 good reaction of franck players 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.990
 dumas who have won only four matches 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.209
 at home on 15 still play a 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.920
 knock next 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.530
 but the local players are showing 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.140
 beautiful abilities to return to the score 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.640
 the Nîmes do not disarm and benefit 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.270
 continues to be the best player of 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.170
 his team 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.680
 he gets a good free kick but the 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.180
 free kick gives nothing 1 0 to mid 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.709
 time in favor of Nîmes it's a good 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.750
 outside result for Nîmes 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.340
 who have average scores on all four 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.120
 last matches a draw a draw and 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.709
 two losses 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.090
 but they are always in the game for 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.920
 the climb it will be necessary to realize 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.390
 the feat of holding up in seconds 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.680
 period against eleven players 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.040
 of arles-avignon who is struggling to 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.800
 equalize and that's the purpose of the everywhere he 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.700
 is signed raphael caceres in the 66th 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.860
 minute 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.860
 this is his third goal of the season 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.870
 nîmes who must now hold the match 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.519
 no one outside and do not lose this 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.040
 meet the players of arles-avignon 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.920
 background while digital superiority for 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.989
 prevail 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.280
 a lot of mocking actions and nîmes 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.280
 who are doing well 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.299
 arles avignon who has not lost since 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.150
 four games two wins and two 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.129
 null and who is fighting well to get the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.110
 as soon as possible its maintenance in 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.690
 league 2 both teams have given everything 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.010
 and nîmes finally tears a beautiful 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 point of the draw on the field of arles 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.730
 avignon 1 everywhere
