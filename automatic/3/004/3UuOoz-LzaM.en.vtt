00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and why not is exactly the same as the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
and why not is exactly the same as the
Tampax<00:02:03.659> pearl<00:02:04.049> compact<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
Tampax pearl compact so you know you

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.199 
Tampax pearl compact so you know you
just<00:02:06.719> pull<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> applicator<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
just pull out the applicator and then it

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.029 
just pull out the applicator and then it
has<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.629> which<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.440> grip<00:02:10.860> or

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
has this which is like the grip or

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
has this which is like the grip or
whatever<00:02:11.310> although<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.360> much

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
whatever although it's not really much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.400 
whatever although it's not really much
of<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.900> grip

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of a grip

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.270 
of a grip
and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.120> little<00:02:16.280> dotted

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and then it has like the little dotted

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
and then it has like the little dotted
area<00:02:17.790> right<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.330> probably<00:02:18.600> can't<00:02:18.990> tell

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
area right there you probably can't tell

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.980 
area right there you probably can't tell
that<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.380> output<00:02:19.770> then<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.730> sorry<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
going to do in absorbency test as you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
going to do in absorbency test as you
can<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> water<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.210> about<00:02:42.870> like

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
can see the water is too about like

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.950 
can see the water is too about like
right<00:02:43.350> there<00:02:44.240> right<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:46.220> there<00:02:47.720> yeah<00:02:48.720> but

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
right there right there there yeah but

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.080 
right there right there there yeah but
right<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.670> they<00:02:50.670> didn't<00:02:50.820> want<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> do

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
right there and they didn't want to do

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.370 
right there and they didn't want to do
it<00:02:51.180> too<00:02:51.300> high<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.750> want<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.140> more

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
it too high because I want it to be more

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.750 
it too high because I want it to be more
like<00:02:52.560> an<00:02:52.680> accurate<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.340> representations<00:02:53.760> but

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.670 

I'm<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.030> kind<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:01.280> putting<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.580> top<00:03:02.820> in

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
I'm just kind of like putting the top in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.320 
I'm just kind of like putting the top in
to<00:03:04.680> let<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.980> absorb<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.790> don't<00:03:05.850> want<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> put<00:03:06.240> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
to let it absorb I don't want to put the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.700 
to let it absorb I don't want to put the
whole<00:03:06.450> thing<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> gets<00:03:07.470> all

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
whole thing in because then it gets all

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.020 
whole thing in because then it gets all
trophy<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.310> not<00:03:08.520> really<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.820> great

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
trophy and it's not really a great

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
trophy and it's not really a great
absorbency<00:03:09.750> test<00:03:09.960> about<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:11.660> um<00:03:12.660> yeah<00:03:12.990> okay<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
absorbency test about it um yeah okay I

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.610 
absorbency test about it um yeah okay I
think<00:03:13.710> it's<00:03:13.950> about<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.020> about<00:03:16.290> what

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
think it's about so this is about what

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.360 
think it's about so this is about what
it<00:03:16.740> absorbed<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.760> what<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.000> expanded<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it absorbed to like what it expanded to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.820 
it absorbed to like what it expanded to
its<00:03:20.370> relatively<00:03:21.240> so<00:03:21.840> especially<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.500> bottom

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
its relatively so especially the bottom

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.440 
its relatively so especially the bottom
someone<00:03:23.130> squeeze<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.670> half<00:03:23.820> alone<00:03:24.150> let<00:03:24.360> me

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
someone squeeze in half alone let me

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.520 
someone squeeze in half alone let me
just<00:03:24.600> show<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.900> much<00:03:24.990> water's<00:03:25.350> left<00:03:27.530> so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just show you how much water's left so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.570 
just show you how much water's left so
it<00:03:28.680> absorb<00:03:29.010> out<00:03:29.220> half<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.610> what<00:03:29.760> was<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.000> there

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
it absorb out half of what was in there

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.970 
it absorb out half of what was in there
yeah<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:33.540> would<00:03:33.870> probably<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.500> about<00:03:34.740> its

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
yeah this would probably be about its

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.740 
yeah this would probably be about its
maximum<00:03:35.580> capacity<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:36.300> it's<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.630> like

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
maximum capacity but it's not like

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.520 
maximum capacity but it's not like
dripping<00:03:37.110> anything<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.730> that's<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.030> good<00:03:39.150> thing

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
dripping anything so that's a good thing

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.570 
dripping anything so that's a good thing
um<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.760> what<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.000> expanded<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:44.459> know

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
um this is what it expanded to you know

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.970 
um this is what it expanded to you know
it<00:03:44.700> expands<00:03:45.209> like<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.420> awkward<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.290> rectangle

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
it expands like a awkward like rectangle

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.240 
it expands like a awkward like rectangle
thingy<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> brick<00:03:48.060> kind<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.660> and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
thingy like a brick kind of like and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.100 
thingy like a brick kind of like and
it's<00:03:50.250> about<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.940> size<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.330> my<00:03:51.390> fingers

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
it's about like the size of my fingers

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's about like the size of my fingers
like<00:03:52.910> like<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:55.620> about<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.340> size<00:03:56.580> of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
like like it's about like the size of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.790 
like like it's about like the size of
these<00:03:56.910> two<00:03:57.180> fingers<00:03:57.390> right<00:03:57.720> here<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.880> yeah<00:04:00.209> um

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.229 

overall<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:04.830> personally<00:04:05.640> think<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.150> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
overall I personally think that it is a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.940 
overall I personally think that it is a
good<00:04:06.450> tampon<00:04:06.959> sorry<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.230> know<00:04:07.620> where<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.830> put

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
good tampon sorry I know where to put

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.780 
good tampon sorry I know where to put
this<00:04:08.100> okay<00:04:10.070> overall<00:04:11.070> I<00:04:11.100> personally<00:04:11.700> think

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
this okay overall I personally think

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.090 
this okay overall I personally think
it's<00:04:11.940> like<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.120> tampon<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.840> don't<00:04:13.350> have<00:04:13.500> troubles

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
it's like a tampon I don't have troubles

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.949 
it's like a tampon I don't have troubles
leaking<00:04:14.580> or<00:04:14.730> anything<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.300> like<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.840> leak

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
leaking or anything I like the leak

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.180 
leaking or anything I like the leak
guard<00:04:16.169> skirt<00:04:16.440> some<00:04:16.680> people<00:04:16.919> say<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.160> doesn't
