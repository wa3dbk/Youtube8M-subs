last<00:05:16.240> night<00:05:16.510> hand<00:05:16.840> tacked<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.650> bias<00:05:18.130> on<00:05:18.520> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
last night hand tacked the bias on the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.700 
last night hand tacked the bias on the
inside<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.630> bias<00:05:20.020> just<00:05:20.260> cut<00:05:20.470> from<00:05:20.680> the

same<00:05:20.950> material<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.460> this<00:05:21.669> white<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.270> mean<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.740> it

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
same material as this white I mean so it

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.710 
same material as this white I mean so it
crosses<00:05:24.280> right<00:05:24.430> over<00:05:24.729> front<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.180> gets<00:05:25.419> sewn

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
here's the back I actually think the

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.820 
here's the back I actually think the
color<00:05:32.020> is<00:05:32.140> supposed<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.620> lay<00:05:32.770> flat<00:05:34.530> but<00:05:35.530> for<00:05:35.710> me

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
color is supposed to lay flat but for me

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.260 
color is supposed to lay flat but for me
it's<00:05:35.979> going<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.250> be<00:05:36.340> bumped<00:05:36.640> up<00:05:36.700> a<00:05:36.850> little<00:05:37.090> bit

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
it's going to be bumped up a little bit

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.300 
it's going to be bumped up a little bit

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
which is okay that's kind of the way I

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.150

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
maybe a tulip sleeve design which would

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.159 
maybe a tulip sleeve design which would
overlap<00:05:59.350> this<00:05:59.650> way<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.130> this<00:06:00.310> way<00:06:00.900> not<00:06:01.900> really

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
overlap this way and this way not really

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.800 
overlap this way and this way not really
