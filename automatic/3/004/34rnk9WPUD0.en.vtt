00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
put together by reverse engineering my

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
put together by reverse engineering my
life<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> steps<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> takes<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

psychotherapist<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.890> found<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
psychotherapist I found that you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.310 
psychotherapist I found that you
actually<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.420> backs<00:02:06.869> by<00:02:07.110> some

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
actually have to have it backs by some

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960 
actually have to have it backs by some
clinical<00:02:07.860> stuff<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
clinical stuff so that you know that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.330 
clinical stuff so that you know that
this<00:02:09.090> isn't<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.599> happy<00:02:10.319> feel-good<00:02:10.590> stories

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
this isn't just happy feel-good stories

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.330 
this isn't just happy feel-good stories
it's<00:02:11.580> actually

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it's actually

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.430 
it's actually
based<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.819> science<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.599> what's<00:02:14.170> interesting

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
based in science and what's interesting

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
based in science and what's interesting
is<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:16.000> were

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
is I think it goes back to when you were

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.520 
is I think it goes back to when you were
about<00:02:16.269> 10<00:02:16.540> years<00:02:16.660> old<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.140> Halloween

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
about 10 years old on Halloween

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.259 
about 10 years old on Halloween
something<00:02:17.950> your<00:02:18.069> mother<00:02:18.250> said<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
you talked about it in the book but it's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.619 
you talked about it in the book but it's
something<00:02:21.400> that's<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.760> simple<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.360> all

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.660 
something that's so simple that we all
can<00:02:22.840> live<00:02:23.050> by<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.650> simple<00:02:24.010> question<00:02:24.099> she

of<00:03:01.150> different<00:03:01.510> catchphrases<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.319> here<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.769> I

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
of different catchphrases in here that I

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.039 
of different catchphrases in here that I
think<00:03:02.920> are<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.370> simple<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.790> remember<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
think are so simple to remember and and

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.809 
think are so simple to remember and and
yet<00:03:05.260> mean<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.860> much<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.370> guess<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> one

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
yet mean so much and I guess the one

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.270 
yet mean so much and I guess the one
question<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:07.720> how<00:03:08.560> do<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.769> do<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.099> how

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
question I have is how do you do it how

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.880 
question I have is how do you do it how
