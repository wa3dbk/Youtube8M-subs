first half just about and we didn't play

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.260 
first half just about and we didn't play
well<00:06:12.830> attacking<00:06:13.830> defending<00:06:14.070> was<00:06:14.520> good<00:06:14.729> but

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
well attacking defending was good but

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.560 
well attacking defending was good but
attacking<00:06:15.630> wasn't<00:06:16.229> that<00:06:16.320> good<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.830> I'm<00:06:17.760> very

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
attacking wasn't that good and I'm very

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.900 
attacking wasn't that good and I'm very
proud<00:06:18.870> of<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.139> way<00:06:19.260> we<00:06:19.290> turned<00:06:19.620> that<00:06:19.680> around

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
proud of the way we turned that around

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.520 
proud of the way we turned that around
the<00:06:20.910> talk<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.419> had<00:06:21.510> it's<00:06:21.630> halftime<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.440> the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
the talk we had it's halftime and the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.070 
the talk we had it's halftime and the
fact<00:06:22.830> that<00:06:22.919> we<00:06:23.130> changed<00:06:23.970> so<00:06:24.180> many<00:06:24.330> players<00:06:24.690> and

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
fact that we changed so many players and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.290 
fact that we changed so many players and
that<00:06:25.229> is<00:06:25.410> difficult<00:06:25.680> for<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.160> team<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:27.180> know

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
that is difficult for a team you know

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.390 
that is difficult for a team you know
coming<00:06:27.720> in<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.930> second<00:06:28.199> half<00:06:28.410> but<00:06:28.770> I<00:06:29.130> think

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
coming in the second half but I think

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.620 
coming in the second half but I think
we'll<00:06:29.490> play<00:06:29.610> better<00:06:29.940> than<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.180> second<00:06:30.450> half

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
we'll play better than the second half

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.820 
we'll play better than the second half
and<00:06:31.639> it<00:06:32.639> was<00:06:32.910> called<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:34.110> goal<00:06:34.650> was

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
and it was called that goal was

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.620 
and it was called that goal was
important<00:06:35.340> to<00:06:35.729> come<00:06:35.880> up<00:06:36.000> with<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.210> win

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
important to come up with a win

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.280 
important to come up with a win
so<00:06:36.860> overall<00:06:38.270> wonderful<00:06:39.270> experience<00:06:39.690> it's<00:06:40.050> a

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
so overall wonderful experience it's a

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.110 
so overall wonderful experience it's a
very<00:06:40.860> important<00:06:41.370> spirit<00:06:41.639> for<00:06:41.790> us<00:06:41.940> going

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
very important spirit for us going

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.870 
very important spirit for us going
forward<00:06:42.889> well<00:06:43.889> I<00:06:43.919> think<00:06:44.100> when<00:06:44.370> we<00:06:44.550> started<00:06:44.790> the

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
forward well I think when we started the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.310 
forward well I think when we started the
first<00:06:45.000> half<00:06:45.150> things<00:06:45.540> were<00:06:45.660> really<00:06:45.870> jumbled

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
first half things were really jumbled

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.080 
first half things were really jumbled
you<00:06:46.560> know<00:06:46.710> they<00:06:47.280> were<00:06:47.340> playing<00:06:47.639> high<00:06:47.790> pressure

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
you know they were playing high pressure

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.790 
you know they were playing high pressure
you<00:06:48.240> know<00:06:48.570> totally<00:06:49.350> putting<00:06:49.590> a<00:06:49.650> lot<00:06:49.770> of

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
you know totally putting a lot of

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.110 
you know totally putting a lot of
pressure<00:06:49.919> on<00:06:50.100> our<00:06:50.250> backs<00:06:50.460> it<00:06:50.700> was<00:06:50.820> really<00:06:50.970> hard

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
pressure on our backs it was really hard

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.300 
pressure on our backs it was really hard
to<00:06:51.150> hold<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.450> ball<00:06:51.600> and<00:06:51.780> keep<00:06:51.930> it<00:06:52.110> and<00:06:52.310> get

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
to hold the ball and keep it and get

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.800 
to hold the ball and keep it and get
that<00:06:53.430> rhythm<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.820> we<00:06:53.970> normally<00:06:54.090> have<00:06:54.450> in

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
that rhythm that we normally have in

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.750 
that rhythm that we normally have in
other<00:06:54.960> games<00:06:55.260> so<00:06:55.620> Brazil<00:06:56.340> did<00:06:56.430> a<00:06:56.490> really<00:06:56.610> good

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
other games so Brazil did a really good

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.670 
other games so Brazil did a really good
job<00:06:56.820> of<00:06:57.000> just<00:06:57.210> you<00:06:57.570> know<00:06:57.660> holding<00:06:57.990> us<00:06:58.110> off<00:06:58.260> and

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
job of just you know holding us off and

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.250 
job of just you know holding us off and
not<00:06:58.860> letting<00:06:59.039> us<00:06:59.160> not<00:06:59.370> have<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.520> lot<00:06:59.669> of<00:06:59.699> attack

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
not letting us not have a lot of attack

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.480 
not letting us not have a lot of attack
but<00:07:01.260> in<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.560> second<00:07:01.860> half<00:07:02.010> we<00:07:02.220> wouldn't

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
but in the second half we wouldn't

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.529 
but in the second half we wouldn't
halftime<00:07:02.820> fell

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
halftime fell

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.050 
halftime fell
you<00:07:04.020> know<00:07:04.139> momentum<00:07:04.680> go<00:07:04.979> on<00:07:05.130> PA<00:07:05.430> I<00:07:05.580> could<00:07:05.910> talk

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
you know momentum go on PA I could talk

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.969 
you know momentum go on PA I could talk
with<00:07:06.090> us<00:07:06.360> and<00:07:06.630> we<00:07:06.750> just<00:07:06.780> came<00:07:07.050> out<00:07:07.169> on<00:07:07.350> fire<00:07:07.560> and

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
with us and we just came out on fire and

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.080 
with us and we just came out on fire and
I<00:07:08.010> think<00:07:08.160> we<00:07:08.220> had<00:07:08.340> more<00:07:08.430> time<00:07:08.490> it's<00:07:08.850> basically

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
I think we had more time it's basically

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.330 
I think we had more time it's basically
and<00:07:09.419> now<00:07:09.510> attack<00:07:09.780> and<00:07:09.990> do<00:07:10.080> more<00:07:10.260> do<00:07:11.160> more

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
and now attack and do more do more

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.909 
and now attack and do more do more
against<00:07:11.910> the<00:07:12.000> Brazil<00:07:12.389> you<00:07:12.750> know<00:07:12.870> defense<00:07:13.200> it

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
against the Brazil you know defense it

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.339 
against the Brazil you know defense it
was<00:07:14.220> a<00:07:14.580> tiring<00:07:15.030> game<00:07:15.389> you<00:07:15.690> know<00:07:15.810> we've<00:07:16.200> been

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 
was a tiring game you know we've been

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.110 
was a tiring game you know we've been
training<00:07:16.740> really<00:07:16.919> hard<00:07:17.039> and<00:07:17.520> you<00:07:17.849> know<00:07:17.940> I<00:07:17.970> was

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
training really hard and you know I was

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.490 
training really hard and you know I was
pretty<00:07:18.300> tired<00:07:18.479> from<00:07:18.660> the<00:07:18.720> very<00:07:18.900> beginning<00:07:19.020> so

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
pretty tired from the very beginning so

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.560 
pretty tired from the very beginning so
I<00:07:19.800> think<00:07:20.099> a<00:07:20.310> lot<00:07:20.490> of<00:07:20.520> it<00:07:20.700> was<00:07:20.820> mental<00:07:21.180> and<00:07:21.450> it

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
I think a lot of it was mental and it

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.540 
I think a lot of it was mental and it
was<00:07:21.690> just<00:07:21.810> a<00:07:21.870> matter<00:07:22.080> of<00:07:22.169> being<00:07:22.470> able<00:07:22.650> to<00:07:22.800> push

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
was just a matter of being able to push

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.219 
was just a matter of being able to push
through<00:07:23.669> for<00:07:23.880> 90<00:07:24.120> minutes<00:07:24.240> and<00:07:24.660> you<00:07:24.930> know<00:07:25.020> it

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229 
through for 90 minutes and you know it

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:27.200 
through for 90 minutes and you know it
they're<00:07:25.770> very<00:07:25.800> physical<00:07:26.130> so<00:07:26.639> I<00:07:26.669> think<00:07:27.060> it's

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
they're very physical so I think it's

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.730 
they're very physical so I think it's
you<00:07:27.810> not<00:07:27.960> like<00:07:28.110> the<00:07:28.229> other<00:07:28.320> teams<00:07:28.560> that<00:07:28.620> we

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
you not like the other teams that we

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.620 
you not like the other teams that we
haven't<00:07:29.010> thought<00:07:29.280> we<00:07:29.610> played<00:07:29.760> it<00:07:29.910> aren't<00:07:30.270> but

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630 
haven't thought we played it aren't but

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.940 
haven't thought we played it aren't but
I<00:07:30.660> think<00:07:30.960> this<00:07:31.080> team<00:07:31.289> is<00:07:31.320> just<00:07:31.620> it's<00:07:31.770> a<00:07:31.830> little

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
I think this team is just it's a little

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.920 
I think this team is just it's a little
different<00:07:32.400> and<00:07:32.550> you<00:07:33.120> know<00:07:33.240> very<00:07:33.510> fast-paced

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
different and you know very fast-paced

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.560 
different and you know very fast-paced
very<00:07:34.889> hectic<00:07:35.070> at<00:07:35.340> time<00:07:35.550> so<00:07:35.910> you<00:07:35.970> know<00:07:36.300> it's<00:07:36.450> up

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570 
very hectic at time so you know it's up

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.060
