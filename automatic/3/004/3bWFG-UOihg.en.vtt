00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.029
 very good totals here commenting here 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.440
 we are in the first episode of the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.750
 new series that I want to do school 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 elite in which I'm going to make reviews of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.039
 all the elite weapons that I have in my 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.990
 account is worth one of them that I have is the 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.050
 vall 27 hell so let's go for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.880
 she 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.619
 and well we're going to start with a 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.720
 template that I have made here in photoshop 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.180
 which is quite elaborate so 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.939
 Well, I hope you value the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.550
 work that I have done when doing it as 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.519
 comes said model inferno royalty is 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.519
 the elite adds up because this is what gives 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.470
 bonus to the weapon and you know that the 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.909
 normal vall as it has nothing and added 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.010
 neither nor lowered in this one in this one 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.260
 this model better said because it adds a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 decadence and I get two down there add up 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.010
 two driving the truth is that it shows 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.840
 quite because the cadence gives it a 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.989
 touch that good because it shows quite 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.579
 then when I commented what the cadence 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.489
 that has this weapon because you'll see how 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.670
 the one of this one from this model to the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.190
 normal is quite noticeable and as it remains for 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.440
 the rest to three of mobility that neither 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.170
 I think it will affect you a lot 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.830
 and we went to the next template as 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 charger 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 this weapon will come with 32 bullets 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 additional if we do not put any 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.340
 accessory and if we put the accessory 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.010
 double charger will be increased to 48 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.230
 the same goes for the ammunition if it does not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.040
 we put nothing will have 96 if we put the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.370
 double then it will have 192 of recharge it takes 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.530
 about 42 seconds if we give once a 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.100
 reload if we give twice to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.900
 square equis or in which case yes 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 we were in play because if we give 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.940
 twice squared will be recharged in 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 125 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.070
 empty recharge is to say if you have zero 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 bullets in the charger will take two 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 seconds because we have to put the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.399
 latch you know that takes longer 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.649
 ok guys let's move on to comment now 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.290
 same the damage the cadence and the scope 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.970
 of this weapon as a year we will have 34 of 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 maximum and 24 minimum 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.950
 a pretty acceptable bathroom is nothing 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.980
 bad and you know that this model does not 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 sum damage so it will not be seen 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.450
 Increased cadence will start with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 750 and it will end with 1000 you already know that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220
 this weapon starts firing slower and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.989
 ends up firing faster is then yes 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.730
 that as this model is a cadence 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.349
 because it goes a little faster than 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.440
 another shoots faster than the other 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.490
 as a scope we are going to have three measurements 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.830
 short medium and long 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.750
 of scope we will have to kill three of 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.810
 three shots at close range of four 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.250
 of average distance and five of long the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 truth is that it is very well you know 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.380
 that if we put a hilt or something 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.060
 so it will help a lot when we are 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.410
 killing from afar so you do not 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.480
 shudder both weapons 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.220
 Now I'm going to recommend a class that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 I have done very well with the valve 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 internal and that I hope I hope the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.010
 you try and you will tell me for the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.740
 comments how are you doing if you have it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.260
 obviously from accessory weapon you 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.640
 we will put the vertical handle thing 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.290
 that will not go for both 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.780
 up and such that it does not have much 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.720
 a lot of recoil but good as it has 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.890
 so much cadence something something does have 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.570
 butt you already know that for all 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.180
 assault rifles goes very well for the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.920
 mobility and such and muffler that good 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660
 this is more optional to me I like it more 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.480
 continue with silencer but if not what 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.950
 you have a silencer you can put 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.959
 Unfurled fast that will spread the same 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.090
 let's go with the advantages as 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.060
 advantage 1 we will take unnoticed thing 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.970
 that will make us not leave on the map 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.950
 with the new one it is worth as an advantage 2 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.420
 We will take peripherals, this I take 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.180
 because my screen is badly configured 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.340
 and if it took it without peripherals the minimum 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.930
 for is very tiny and how I have it 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.970
 misconfigured average minimum sucks 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.099
 by then he does not let me see then 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.019
 I wear this for apart from having more 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.760
 vision of the map and as it is a 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.739
 player who is all the time watching the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.510
 mini map so that to be able to see 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.790
 minimap at least could from another 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.290
 way could not or advantage 3 we will take 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.030
 scavenger and detonation suppressor 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.650
 scavenger to not run out of bullets and 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.209
 of his detonation weight to not 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.970
 appear on the mini map when we do 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.010
 a dash or a double jump is also the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.989
 Possibility position to carry 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.609
 hardness I think we'll change it for 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.310
 detonation suppressor in any case like this 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.049
 how good that already by own selection 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.419
 as gusts we will carry the egg go with 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.360
 threat detector and support for when 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.970
 kill us let's continue the streak and time that 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.800
 It's quite an attack drone state 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.310
 we will take it with control of 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.560
 ay of the vision increase guide 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.740
 and the guard that we will take with him 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.210
 aggressor and with the missiles are some 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.950
 gusts that are quite effective for 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.410
 give as fierce and good because you're in 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.630
 the classes but you liked it or if you
