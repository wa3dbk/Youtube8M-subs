I'm<00:00:38.420> going<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:38.960> my<00:00:39.200> original<00:00:39.950> one<00:00:40.070> of<00:00:40.130> my

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
I'm going with my original one of my

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.490 
I'm going with my original one of my
older<00:00:40.610> predictions<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:41.630> is<00:00:41.840> Ezekiel

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
older predictions that it is Ezekiel

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.930 
older predictions that it is Ezekiel
that<00:00:42.650> gets<00:00:42.890> killed<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:43.400> makes<00:00:43.610> sense

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
that gets killed that makes sense

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.880 
that gets killed that makes sense
because<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.600> blood<00:00:44.810> for<00:00:45.020> blood<00:00:45.260> because

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
because of the blood for blood because

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.770 
because of the blood for blood because
we<00:00:46.010> shown<00:00:46.280> would<00:00:46.520> be<00:00:46.640> out<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:46.970> blood<00:00:47.060> and<00:00:47.420> it

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
we shown would be out for blood and it

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.780 
we shown would be out for blood and it
does<00:00:47.930> make<00:00:48.170> sense<00:00:48.410> before<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.920> thought<00:00:49.310> he<00:00:49.610> was

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
does make sense before I thought he was

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.400 
does make sense before I thought he was
on<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.060> road<00:00:50.300> remember<00:00:50.810> how<00:00:50.900> I<00:00:50.930> kept<00:00:51.260> talking

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
on the road remember how I kept talking

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.260 
on the road remember how I kept talking
about<00:00:51.680> how<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.010> just<00:00:52.130> feel<00:00:52.520> like<00:00:52.670> somebody<00:00:53.090> is

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
about how I just feel like somebody is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.390 
about how I just feel like somebody is
on<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.570> road<00:00:53.810> getting<00:00:54.290> attacked<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.160> think

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
on the road getting attacked and I think

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.860 
on the road getting attacked and I think
that's<00:00:55.550> dead<00:00:55.880> on<00:00:55.910> I<00:00:56.090> think<00:00:56.360> that's<00:00:56.570> pretty

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
that's dead on I think that's pretty

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.800

awesome<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.500> what<00:00:58.190> what<00:00:58.790> stopped<00:00:59.270> me<00:00:59.510> was

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
awesome and what what stopped me was

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.319 
awesome and what what stopped me was
Ezekiel<00:01:00.680> being<00:01:01.220> at<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.520> fair<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:02.210> like

an expected reunion moment so we know
that<00:01:32.450> most<00:01:32.810> likely<00:01:33.170> he<00:01:33.650> finds<00:01:34.040> somebody<00:01:34.340> I

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.920 
that most likely he finds somebody I
don't<00:01:34.549> think<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.120> Walking<00:01:35.420> Dead<00:01:35.450> comics

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
don't think that the Walking Dead comics

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.930 
don't think that the Walking Dead comics
is<00:01:35.990> going<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.260> do<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> flashback<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.670> most

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
is going to do a flashback so most

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.500 
is going to do a flashback so most
likely<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.659> going<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:38.930> tell<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.229> story<00:01:39.710> of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
likely it's going to tell the story of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.370 
be like okay I'm just gonna go after you
know<00:01:53.060> maybe<00:01:53.360> you'll<00:01:53.510> find<00:01:53.810> her<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> road

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
know maybe you'll find her on the road

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.289 
know maybe you'll find her on the road
maybe<00:01:54.650> she's<00:01:54.920> out<00:01:55.130> there<00:01:55.280> close<00:01:55.580> by<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.090> he

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
maybe she's out there close by so he

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.910 
maybe she's out there close by so he
gets<00:01:56.510> on<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.720> road<00:01:57.049> because<00:01:57.409> we<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.710> know

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
gets on the road because we do know

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.830 
gets on the road because we do know
these<00:01:58.130> roads<00:01:58.400> have<00:01:58.729> some<00:01:58.970> sort<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.299> structure

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
these roads have some sort of structure

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.350 
these roads have some sort of structure
or<00:01:59.920> patrol<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.189> them<00:02:01.369> he<00:02:01.700> gets<00:02:01.909> out<00:02:02.090> there<00:02:02.330> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
or patrol to them he gets out there and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.859 
or patrol to them he gets out there and
maybe<00:02:02.780> alpha<00:02:03.470> not<00:02:03.680> only<00:02:04.100> encounters<00:02:04.820> one<00:02:05.600> of

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
maybe alpha not only encounters one of

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.279 
maybe alpha not only encounters one of
Rick<00:02:06.619> or<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.070> community's<00:02:07.670> Patrol<00:02:08.269> guys<00:02:08.539> but

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
Rick or the community's Patrol guys but

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.370 
Rick or the community's Patrol guys but
she<00:02:09.619> might<00:02:09.890> also<00:02:10.069> encounter<00:02:10.910> Ezekiel<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.200> we

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
she might also encounter Ezekiel so we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.870 
she might also encounter Ezekiel so we
might<00:02:12.590> think<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.040> Ezekiel

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
might think that Ezekiel

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.850 
might think that Ezekiel
is<00:02:13.940> dead<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.450> here<00:02:14.660> she<00:02:14.870> kills<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.410> patrol

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
is dead and here she kills the patrol

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.900 
is dead and here she kills the patrol
guy<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.540> either<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.960> kills<00:02:18.410> Ezekiel<00:02:18.980> which<00:02:19.160> he

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
guy and either a kills Ezekiel which he

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400 
guy and either a kills Ezekiel which he
kills<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.240> big<00:02:20.420> enough<00:02:20.600> character<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> don't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
kills a big enough character I don't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.470 
kills a big enough character I don't
think<00:02:21.620> they'll<00:02:21.770> kill<00:02:22.010> him<00:02:22.480> off-screen

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
think they'll kill him off-screen

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
think they'll kill him off-screen
although<00:02:24.110> they<00:02:24.290> might<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.070> tragic<00:02:25.610> and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
although they might if it's a tragic and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820 
although they might if it's a tragic and
bloody<00:02:25.940> reveal<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.870> him<00:02:27.110> skinned<00:02:27.620> and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
bloody reveal like him skinned and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.040 
bloody reveal like him skinned and
hanging<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.760> since<00:02:29.030> that's<00:02:29.150> most<00:02:29.480> likely<00:02:29.720> not

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
hanging but since that's most likely not

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.890 
hanging but since that's most likely not
the<00:02:30.080> case<00:02:30.440> due<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.800> time<00:02:31.700> constraints<00:02:32.480> against

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the case due to time constraints against

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.720 
the case due to time constraints against
alpha<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> he<00:02:34.370> was<00:02:34.550> either

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
alpha I think that he was either

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.030 
alpha I think that he was either
mutilated<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.900> know<00:02:36.020> missing<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.590> missing

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
mutilated you know missing or missing

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.000 
mutilated you know missing or missing
leg<00:02:37.310> or<00:02:37.610> he<00:02:38.210> was<00:02:38.330> fatally<00:02:38.960> wounded<00:02:39.290> or

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
leg or he was fatally wounded or

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.430 
leg or he was fatally wounded or
severely<00:02:40.520> wounded<00:02:41.090> he<00:02:41.480> might<00:02:41.690> even<00:02:41.840> recover

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
severely wounded he might even recover

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
severely wounded he might even recover
but<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.860> think<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.430> possible<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.000> he<00:02:44.150> does

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
but I think it is possible that he does

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.010 
but I think it is possible that he does
die<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.050> let's<00:02:45.920> say<00:02:46.130> he<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.550> severely<00:02:47.480> wounded

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
die and let's say he is severely wounded

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.450 
die and let's say he is severely wounded
to<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.200> point<00:02:48.500> where<00:02:48.650> he<00:02:48.800> does<00:02:48.980> die<00:02:49.190> because

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
to the point where he does die because

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.670 
to the point where he does die because
of<00:02:49.760> his<00:02:49.880> wounds<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.600> he's<00:02:50.750> able<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.350> make<00:02:51.530> it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
of his wounds but he's able to make it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280 
of his wounds but he's able to make it
back<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.220> camp<00:02:52.520> or<00:02:52.820> what<00:02:53.690> would<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:53.870> even

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
back to the camp or what would be even

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.920 
back to the camp or what would be even
more<00:02:54.320> tragic<00:02:55.100> he's<00:02:55.580> trying<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.270> get<00:02:56.420> back<00:02:56.480> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
more tragic he's trying to get back and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.990 
more tragic he's trying to get back and

meeting alpha they follow a trail of

more about my thoughts and why I am
disappointed<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:17.960> part<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.590> story

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
disappointed at this part in the story

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.890 
disappointed at this part in the story
go<00:03:19.220> ahead<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.640> watch<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:20.000> review<00:03:20.480> for<00:03:20.510> issue

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
go ahead and watch my review for issue

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.460 
go ahead and watch my review for issue
143<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.310> again<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.790> recap<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.600> think<00:03:23.990> the<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
143 so again to recap I think the the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.150 
143 so again to recap I think the the
puppy-dog<00:03:24.800> look<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.490> Rick<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.300> fact<00:03:26.600> of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
puppy-dog look on Rick is the fact of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.410 
puppy-dog look on Rick is the fact of
realizing<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.190> severity<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.210> situation

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
realizing the severity of the situation

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.930 
realizing the severity of the situation
better<00:03:30.020> yet<00:03:30.260> he's<00:03:30.530> realizing<00:03:31.070> how<00:03:31.370> dangerous

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
better yet he's realizing how dangerous

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.990 
better yet he's realizing how dangerous
this<00:03:32.240> situation<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.020> he's<00:03:33.980> truly<00:03:34.370> seeing<00:03:34.820> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
this situation is he's truly seeing the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.170 
this situation is he's truly seeing the
magnitude<00:03:35.210> of<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:37.430> know<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.820> amount<00:03:38.120> of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
magnitude of you know the amount of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.290 
magnitude of you know the amount of
bloodshed<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:39.590> could<00:03:40.280> transpire<00:03:40.820> if<00:03:41.150> they

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
bloodshed that could transpire if they

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.910 
bloodshed that could transpire if they
do<00:03:41.360> go<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.720> war<00:03:41.990> with<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> Savior's<00:03:42.650> if

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
do go to war with the Savior's if

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.650 
do go to war with the Savior's if
anything<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.820> smallest<00:03:44.150> thing<00:03:44.480> goes

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
anything just the smallest thing goes

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.690 
anything just the smallest thing goes
wrong<00:03:44.900> maybe<00:03:45.230> Rick<00:03:45.530> finally<00:03:45.920> realizes<00:03:46.520> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
wrong maybe Rick finally realizes this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.090 
wrong maybe Rick finally realizes this
so<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.060> think<00:03:47.270> that's<00:03:47.420> what<00:03:47.630> 144<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:48.650> going<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
so I think that's what 144 is going to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.940 
so I think that's what 144 is going to
kind<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.550> be<00:03:49.730> about<00:03:50.170> 145<00:03:51.170> let's<00:03:51.590> say<00:03:51.770> that's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
kind of be about 145 let's say that's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.670 
kind of be about 145 let's say that's
the<00:03:52.220> discovery<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.030> Ezekiel<00:03:53.720> either<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.230> half

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
the discovery of Ezekiel either a half

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.550 
the discovery of Ezekiel either a half
dead<00:03:55.040> or<00:03:55.400> completely<00:03:56.209> dead<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.290> do<00:03:57.350> believe

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
dead or completely dead and I do believe

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.930 
dead or completely dead and I do believe
that<00:03:57.800> there's<00:03:57.920> gonna<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.220> patrol<00:03:58.700> guy<00:03:58.910> I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
that there's gonna be a patrol guy I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.370 
that there's gonna be a patrol guy I
just<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> feeling<00:03:59.750> there's<00:04:00.020> somebody

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
just have a feeling there's somebody

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.990 
just have a feeling there's somebody
else<00:04:00.590> there's<00:04:00.860> some<00:04:01.070> other<00:04:01.250> bloodshed<00:04:01.850> out

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
else there's some other bloodshed out

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.180 
else there's some other bloodshed out
there<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.510> could<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:03.140> be<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.530> patrol<00:04:03.950> guy

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
there it could just be the patrol guy

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.699 
there it could just be the patrol guy
you<00:04:04.459> know<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.880> it<00:04:05.330> could<00:04:05.570> be<00:04:05.720> Kirkman<00:04:06.410> could<00:04:06.590> be

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
you know it it could be Kirkman could be

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.330 
you know it it could be Kirkman could be
tricking<00:04:07.070> us<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:08.030> we're<00:04:08.540> gonna<00:04:08.660> get<00:04:09.340> 146

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
tricking us and then we're gonna get 146

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.820 
tricking us and then we're gonna get 146
is<00:04:10.880> Maggie<00:04:11.420> punch<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.900> Rick<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.560> believe

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
is Maggie punch of Rick and I believe

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.770 
is Maggie punch of Rick and I believe
that<00:04:13.010> is<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:14.000> breaking<00:04:14.330> point<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.750> to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
that is the the breaking point so to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.710 
that is the the breaking point so to
speak<00:04:15.140> where<00:04:15.730> Maggie<00:04:16.730> reveals<00:04:17.299> what<00:04:17.510> happened

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
speak where Maggie reveals what happened

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.960 
speak where Maggie reveals what happened
with<00:04:17.810> Gregory<00:04:18.320> maybe<00:04:18.590> Rick<00:04:18.890> says<00:04:19.220> you're<00:04:19.760> not

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
with Gregory maybe Rick says you're not

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.000 
with Gregory maybe Rick says you're not
you<00:04:20.239> know<00:04:20.359> lead<00:04:20.780> them<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> hilltop<00:04:21.440> anymore

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
you know lead them the hilltop anymore

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.590 
you know lead them the hilltop anymore
I'll<00:04:22.220> put<00:04:22.430> somebody<00:04:22.790> else<00:04:23.000> at<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.300> hilltop

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
I'll put somebody else at the hilltop

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.040 
I'll put somebody else at the hilltop
down

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
down

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.189 
down
I<00:04:24.470> don't<00:04:25.250> believe<00:04:25.879> that<00:04:25.940> has<00:04:26.389> anything<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.930> do

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
I don't believe that has anything to do

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.070 
I don't believe that has anything to do
with<00:04:27.280> Dante<00:04:28.280> or<00:04:28.580> Michonne<00:04:29.000> or<00:04:29.240> Andrea<00:04:29.660> getting

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
with Dante or Michonne or Andrea getting

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080 
with Dante or Michonne or Andrea getting
killed<00:04:30.349> we're<00:04:30.919> led<00:04:31.129> to<00:04:31.160> believe<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.789> it's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
killed we're led to believe that it's

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.809 
killed we're led to believe that it's
Michonne<00:04:32.810> Andrea<00:04:33.470> Dante<00:04:34.009> but<00:04:34.250> think<00:04:34.490> about<00:04:34.669> it

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
Michonne Andrea Dante but think about it

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:35.320 
Michonne Andrea Dante but think about it
like<00:04:34.909> this

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
like this

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.899 
like this
they<00:04:35.629> had<00:04:35.900> them<00:04:36.110> surrounded<00:04:36.740> already<00:04:37.069> alpha

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
they had them surrounded already alpha

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.230 
they had them surrounded already alpha
had<00:04:38.150> trouble<00:04:38.720> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.050> way<00:04:39.080> back<00:04:39.470> from

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
had trouble on the way back from

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
had trouble on the way back from
Alexandria<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.509> I<00:04:42.050> don't<00:04:42.110> think<00:04:42.349> alpha<00:04:43.069> would

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
Alexandria and I don't think alpha would

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.480 
Alexandria and I don't think alpha would
walk<00:04:43.849> past<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.930> know<00:04:45.080> Andreea<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.919> everybody

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
walk past you know Andreea and everybody

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.249 
walk past you know Andreea and everybody
who's<00:04:46.759> already<00:04:47.120> surrounded<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.810> aundrea

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
who's already surrounded and aundrea

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.379 
who's already surrounded and aundrea
Michonne<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.620> Dante<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.460> all<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.270> sudden

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
Michonne and Dante and all of a sudden

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.960 
Michonne and Dante and all of a sudden
have<00:04:50.900> trouble<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.560> doesn't<00:04:51.889> make<00:04:52.039> sense<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.610> I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
have trouble it doesn't make sense so I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.999 
have trouble it doesn't make sense so I
think<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.690> is<00:04:53.900> confirmation<00:04:54.409> that<00:04:54.680> alpha

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
think it that is confirmation that alpha

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.920 
think it that is confirmation that alpha
did<00:04:55.159> run<00:04:55.340> into<00:04:55.520> Ezekiel<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.479> another

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
did run into Ezekiel and another

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.950 
did run into Ezekiel and another
patrolman<00:04:57.620> or<00:04:57.949> just<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.759> zekiel<00:04:59.180> or<00:04:59.389> just<00:04:59.840> a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
patrolman or just a zekiel or just a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.450 
patrolman or just a zekiel or just a
patrolman<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.650> then<00:05:00.979> on<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.280> way<00:05:01.430> back

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
patrolman and then on the way back

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.120 
patrolman and then on the way back
there's<00:05:02.300> either<00:05:02.750> something<00:05:03.199> with<00:05:03.560> Dante

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
there's either something with Dante

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.249 
there's either something with Dante
maybe<00:05:04.400> they<00:05:04.669> do<00:05:04.729> have<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.360> leave<00:05:05.509> Dante<00:05:06.020> back

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
maybe they do have to leave Dante back

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.860 
maybe they do have to leave Dante back
as<00:05:06.530> collateral<00:05:07.400> with<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.120> whispers<00:05:08.569> that

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
as collateral with the whispers that

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.719 
as collateral with the whispers that
would<00:05:09.050> be<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.199> really<00:05:09.530> hard<00:05:09.800> situation<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.430> deal

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
would be a really hard situation to deal

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.580 
would be a really hard situation to deal
with<00:05:10.940> because<00:05:11.150> if<00:05:11.479> Ric<00:05:11.990> allows<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.530> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
with because if Ric allows that to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.499 
with because if Ric allows that to
happen<00:05:12.710> that's<00:05:13.159> pretty<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:14.090> pretty<00:05:14.180> messed

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
happen that's pretty it's pretty messed

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.059 
happen that's pretty it's pretty messed

up you know that's tough

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.860 
up you know that's tough
so<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.789> breaking<00:05:17.240> point<00:05:17.569> could<00:05:17.840> be

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
so the breaking point could be

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.770 
so the breaking point could be
everything<00:05:18.259> Maggie<00:05:19.190> could<00:05:19.580> want<00:05:19.849> to<00:05:19.940> attack

everything Maggie could want to attack

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.779 
everything Maggie could want to attack
Maggie<00:05:21.199> could<00:05:21.590> be<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.830> one<00:05:22.009> also<00:05:22.430> wanting

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
Maggie could be the one also wanting

Maggie could be the one also wanting
blood<00:05:23.000> for<00:05:23.240> blood<00:05:23.479> and<00:05:23.780> Rick<00:05:24.379> says<00:05:24.620> no<00:05:24.830> you're

and Maggie's like no that uh so that

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.659 
and Maggie's like no that uh so that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
something that with Dante it could be

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.439 
something that with Dante it could be
