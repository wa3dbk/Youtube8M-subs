00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.670
 there folks good afternoon I'm here with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:14.330
 nokia c3 cell phone and i believe it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.330
 is with some a nokia own book 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.810
 There are some that my brother has what works. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.460
 Until today it's many years I do not think 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.910
 are all appliances that have this 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 bullying that is the own nokia that does the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:02:10.580
 product with some program or something 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:02:10.580
 the cell phone memory chip 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.070
 I think it will not interfere with anything 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.190
 just try to put here I put this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.180
 video lesson is to take this doubt 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:45.840
 because mine is not the first cell phone 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:49.650
 is giving this problem 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.030
 Putting the battery leaves the camera back 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:01.050
 focus the memory card 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:09.780
 I mean, I'm going to put a very 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:17.370
 complicated nokia has won more customers 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:21.770
 on the line I'll put the paper 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.770
 here you see nothing to do with you 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.490
 and I even put a little paper down and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:50.140
 national equipment that happens 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.140
 now I'll call and your book the nokia c3 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.140
 it has since seemed to work right 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.120
 I turned on the light not welcome from nokia 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.700
 Only then comes the big problem. 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:12.019
 seems to contain gas 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.930
 save yourself puts out it turns off 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.850
 in fact, just click any key 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.510
 sometimes not even need to press any 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:28.340
 no athlete, he already hangs up 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:31.360
 alone is turning on and on. 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.360
 shutting it down again 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.550
 that's it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:05:03.480
 3 young little boy here yesterday and is 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:03.480
 with this problem in the command of sin 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:52.000
 Thank you and see you soon. 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:54.070
 This cell phone has nothing I did not tell 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.640
 anything 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:03.970
 and another it does not accept the one pen drive 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.200
 the sp you can put the usb cable that 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.460
 will erase 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:18.419
 before recognition on the computer 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.419
