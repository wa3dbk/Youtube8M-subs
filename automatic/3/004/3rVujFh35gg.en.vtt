a<00:01:56.030> whole<00:01:56.210> context<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:56.960> plant<00:01:57.229> about<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
a whole context of a plant about the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.010 
a whole context of a plant about the
calories<00:01:58.490> are<00:01:58.880> set<00:01:59.060> at<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.270> certain<00:01:59.450> level<00:01:59.719> and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
calories are set at a certain level and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.260 
calories are set at a certain level and
you<00:02:00.740> follow<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.610> then<00:02:01.819> when<00:02:01.939> your<00:02:02.060> body

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you follow that and then when your body

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.149 
you follow that and then when your body
gets<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.840> point<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.470> don't<00:02:03.860> want<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.069> get

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
gets to that point I don't want to get

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.429 
gets to that point I don't want to get
one<00:02:04.340> winded<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.929> point<00:02:06.200> but<00:02:06.319> it

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
one winded on in on that point but it

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.740 
one winded on in on that point but it
gets<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.679> a<00:02:06.740> point<00:02:06.770> where<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:08.239> type<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
gets to a point where that type of a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.930 
gets to a point where that type of a
spike<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.799> huge<00:02:10.190> benefit<00:02:10.700> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
spike is going to be a huge benefit and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.240 
spike is going to be a huge benefit and
not<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.090> debt<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.959> calories<00:02:12.410> hiking<00:02:12.829> works<00:02:13.069> in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
not a debt so calories hiking works in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.770 
not a debt so calories hiking works in
the<00:02:13.340> right<00:02:13.519> metabolic<00:02:14.090> environments

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780

you know three days when we guess

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.710 
you know three days when we guess
closing<00:02:27.799> two<00:02:28.280> weeks<00:02:28.489> from<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.760> contest<00:02:29.239> how<00:02:29.660> do

closing two weeks from a contest how do

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.900 
closing two weeks from a contest how do
you<00:02:29.989> know<00:02:30.230> when<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:30.680> time<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.980> refute<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
you know when it's time to refute that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.910 
you know when it's time to refute that
well<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> guess<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.349> comes<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.799> experience

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
well I guess just comes from experience

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.370 
well I guess just comes from experience
like<00:02:34.519> I've<00:02:34.670> been<00:02:34.819> doing<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.269> I'm<00:02:35.480> competing

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
like I've been doing this I'm competing

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.020 
like I've been doing this I'm competing
for<00:02:36.739> over<00:02:37.190> 25<00:02:37.639> years<00:02:37.670> now<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:39.549> what<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.639> use

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
for over 25 years now and what you use

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.479 
for over 25 years now and what you use
do<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.569> go<00:02:41.750> by<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.989> weight<00:02:42.319> scale<00:02:42.709> oh<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.100> see

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
do you go by the weight scale oh I see

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.330 
do you go by the weight scale oh I see
you<00:02:43.760> go<00:02:43.910> boy

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you go boy

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460 
you go boy
what's<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.300> no<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.810> weight<00:02:45.989> scale<00:02:46.260> really

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
what's going no the weight scale really

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.080 
what's going no the weight scale really
has<00:02:46.680> nothing<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.129> do<00:02:47.280> with<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.489> although<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
has nothing to do with it although it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.020 
has nothing to do with it although it
can<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> factor<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.560> after<00:02:50.129> your<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.910> year

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
can be a factor like after your one year

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.190 
can be a factor like after your one year
when<00:02:51.330> you're<00:02:51.450> getting<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.840> point<00:02:52.080> where

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
when you're getting to that point where

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.619 
when you're getting to that point where
your<00:02:52.470> mole<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.370> you're<00:02:53.819> ready<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.269> refeed

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
your mole and you're ready for a refeed

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.270 
your mole and you're ready for a refeed
obviously<00:02:55.170> your<00:02:55.319> wing<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.739> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.099> down

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
obviously your wing is going to be down

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.650 
obviously your wing is going to be down
if<00:02:56.550> you're<00:02:56.819> glad<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.629> is

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
if you're glad you but if it is

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.000 
if you're glad you but if it is
certainly<00:02:58.050> look<00:02:58.260> later<00:02:58.440> than<00:02:58.650> stuff<00:02:58.860> like

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
certainly look later than stuff like

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.650 
certainly look later than stuff like
that<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> scale<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.910> tool<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.510> can

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that so the scale is a tool but you can

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
that so the scale is a tool but you can
use<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.250> comes<00:03:02.549> down<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.760> reading

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
use but it really comes down to reading

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.900 
use but it really comes down to reading
your<00:03:03.209> body's<00:03:03.569> biofeedback<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.860> intensity<00:03:05.430> in

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
your body's biofeedback the intensity in

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.449 
your body's biofeedback the intensity in
the<00:03:06.030> gym<00:03:06.239> starts<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.720> suffer<00:03:07.129> you<00:03:08.129> get<00:03:08.310> that

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the gym starts to suffer you get that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.100 
the gym starts to suffer you get that
feeling<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:10.560> overall<00:03:11.190> general<00:03:12.110> lethargy

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
feeling of just overall general lethargy

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.949 
feeling of just overall general lethargy
if<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.739> call<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.129> and<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.690> lack

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
if you want to call it that and so lack

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.979 
if you want to call it that and so lack
of<00:03:16.140> energy<00:03:17.030> has<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> suffer<00:03:18.480> Frank

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
of energy has to suffer Frank

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.890 
of energy has to suffer Frank
deprivation<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.209> mirror<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> course

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
deprivation to and the mirror of course

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.600 
deprivation to and the mirror of course
yeah<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.380> that's<00:03:22.650> how<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.920> lookin<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
yeah and that's how you lookin that you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.580 
yeah and that's how you lookin that you
look<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:23.970> mirror<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:25.019> cannot<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
look in the mirror and you cannot and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.229 
look in the mirror and you cannot and
I've<00:03:25.890> seen<00:03:26.069> people<00:03:26.280> get<00:03:26.549> screwed<00:03:26.849> up<00:03:26.910> by<00:03:27.090> that

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
I've seen people get screwed up by that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.670 
I've seen people get screwed up by that
too<00:03:27.450> because<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.810> look<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> mirror<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
too because I look in the mirror and you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.589 
too because I look in the mirror and you
actually<00:03:28.829> tend<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> get<00:03:29.519> looking<00:03:30.030> softer

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
actually tend to get looking softer

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.539 
actually tend to get looking softer
because<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.379> muscles<00:03:31.530> are<00:03:31.799> less<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.129> plated

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
because the muscles are less be plated
