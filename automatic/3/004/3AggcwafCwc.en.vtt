00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
going to happen because I'm I end up

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.170 
going to happen because I'm I end up
blocking<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.560> sound<00:02:34.800> most<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.310> time<00:02:35.520> so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
blocking the sound most of the time so

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
blocking the sound most of the time so
usually<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.860> the
