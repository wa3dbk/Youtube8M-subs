00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 good people , how are you? 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.919
 It's time to continue making this video here. 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.400
 to be able to show the accessories I 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.080
 I bought myself a ready goal and showed a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.179
 little how much it's worth to us 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.039
 prove the extreme you have enough 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 people still afraid 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.240
 so I'm coming here to show you 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.850
 really things arrive equals 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 half a leg in relation to what 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.970
 We have here in Brazil, and I bought it. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 this monopoly on foot here is actually 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.329
 So you can put the pro and take it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.480
 photo in high places or take photo of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.730
 you even with that works are you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 It has an adjustment here of the lake 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.050
 you put the population you want 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 Gopal stay there, you catch him and here. 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 has an adjustment that would actually be the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.610
 adjustment that we have on the tripod 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 traditional 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 so it actually comes with this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.280
 accessory here it has a dock too 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 a thread 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 You put it here, I learned there's another one. 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.049
 bulletin where you can tighten and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 adjust fit adjusts the box 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.780
 The tire places the tire was here with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.900
 screw and you can shoot with the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.390
 and what is the advantage 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.799
 This cool legal jerk is that he is 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.680
 portray or is you pulling it here 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:33.180
 you can shoot in more 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.070
 far is quite large can not all 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.500
 I'll leave it to you to make one. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.860
 another video I'll show you guys but he 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.590
 has opened the master 10 is too large 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.799
 even from the profarma well from afar he 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 closed so he gets 22 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.360
 centimeters 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 It has a handle that you can too. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.450
 see and it also has another entry here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.479
 a thread actually be for you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.740
 in the piece another tripod to increase the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.409
 longitude 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.030
 or maybe to put on some support 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.520
 to fix on the floor 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.610
 so it's pretty cool where the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.690
 sorry and I paid there on the day you paid me 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.350
 $ 11 is so well worth it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.940
 I'm going to leave excuse here and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.830
 improvisation in fact that these sheets 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.540
 of sulphite here in that like all 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.380
 accessories are black 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.310
 it's easier for you to visualize 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.300
 Another lady I bought was the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.470
 protection of the lens of the gopro itself. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.370
 round here and the protection on the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.300
 Cashier 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:50.590
 You can see here I paid two dollars. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:55.569
 and 20 is worth very much or at least 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.209
 less on the official website at $ 19 more 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.209
 the side plug that this one here too 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 along with her here I do not get these 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.360
 two here but at the original cost 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.709
 $ 19 or $ 2 worth 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.480
 very worthwhile to set aside something else 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.959
 that I actually bought was also 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:28.540
 Tripod mount comes with these two 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:34.870
 here you can see two in the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.570
 camera tripod and this one is the same 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.660
 that comes in at the motel there that I showed 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.370
 It 's the same for you, too. 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:49.470
 came here in that other kit I bought 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.470
 and that I pay 6 dollars and in 78 also 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:04:00.880
 here and there was also an advantage 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:03.790
 Good of you here in the other you need 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.959
 put a screw to fit box 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.820
 screw fast learn to make a 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.890
 another shot you can not 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.640
 this one when you hold here 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.500
 What 's that box like , then you? 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.140
 can take camera out fast 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.810
 confirm something else out of the world 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.130
 loses or is now worth you got 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.530
 here too 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.080
 Okay, I realized that after I bought it. 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.450
 to be honest but it's something worth 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.070
 quite a leg 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.500
 I'll leave the two of you here too. 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.480
 and the other thing that I actually bought 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.490
 were the stickers 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.150
 the stickers for us to be able to catch 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.840
 or supports what are these here then 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.280
 are these four supports that came 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.020
 two brackets which are curved to 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.180
 helmet, forget the guys you already know 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.910
 is also accustomed and two supports 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.540
 rules for smooth surfaces and 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:08.050
 here stickers that come with them are well 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.580
 resistant adhesive is and still is not 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.350
 I used is this one but I already had a 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.140
 another that I used to see that he 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.880
 really was worth it 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.560
 So, people, this movie is this video. 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.180
 It 's short here, I do not want to stretch too far. 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.510
 until I take your time , it's more 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.280
 So we can show you quite a bit. 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.729

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.820
