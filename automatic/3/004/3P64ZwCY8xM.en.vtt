believe there was an item there but was
it<00:03:43.229> a<00:03:43.319> ring<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.560> protection<00:03:43.620> plus<00:03:43.979> 2<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> don't

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
it a ring of protection plus 2 I don't

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.699 
it a ring of protection plus 2 I don't
think<00:03:45.479> so<00:03:45.689> maybe<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.379> portion<00:03:46.620> of

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
think so maybe the portion of

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.069 
think so maybe the portion of
invulnerability<00:03:47.389> but<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.569> doesn't<00:03:48.689> sound

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
invulnerability but that doesn't sound

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.960 
invulnerability but that doesn't sound
right<00:03:49.199> either<00:03:49.259> alright<00:03:50.159> not<00:03:50.340> quite<00:03:50.519> sure<00:03:50.549> what

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
right either alright not quite sure what

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.849 
right either alright not quite sure what
item<00:03:51.239> was<00:03:51.419> dropped<00:03:51.780> behind<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.199> believe<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.680> was

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
item was dropped behind I believe it was

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.129 
item was dropped behind I believe it was
the<00:03:52.919> ring<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.430> protection<00:03:53.519> plus<00:03:54.060> two<00:03:54.329> potion

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
the ring of protection plus two potion

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.270 
the ring of protection plus two potion
well<00:03:55.439> it<00:03:55.590> could<00:03:55.799> be<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.949> potion<00:03:56.129> of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
well it could be a potion of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.330 
well it could be a potion of
invulnerability<00:03:57.259> 533<00:03:58.259> creep<00:03:58.590> Kim<00:03:59.419> no<00:04:00.419> it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
invulnerability 533 creep Kim no it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.009 
invulnerability 533 creep Kim no it's
hmmm<00:04:02.340> i'll<00:04:02.939> have<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.180> double<00:04:03.299> check<00:04:03.479> that<00:04:03.810> or

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
hmmm i'll have to double check that or

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.959 
hmmm i'll have to double check that or
if<00:04:04.319> someone<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.739> let<00:04:04.889> me<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.489> thought

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
if someone can let me know I thought

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.039 
if someone can let me know I thought
he'd<00:04:06.120> pick<00:04:06.269> up<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.479> potion<00:04:06.719> of<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.900> vulnerable

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
he'd pick up the potion of it vulnerable

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.319 
he'd pick up the potion of it vulnerable
to<00:04:07.319> off<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.859> creep<00:04:08.129> camp<00:04:08.370> here<00:04:08.609> alright

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
level two will get to level three after

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.140 
level two will get to level three after
this<00:04:13.019> creep<00:04:13.259> camp<00:04:13.469> goes<00:04:13.650> down<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:14.219> kobold

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.969 
this creep camp goes down I kobold
taskmaster<00:04:15.780> will<00:04:15.989> get<00:04:16.139> taken<00:04:16.380> out<00:04:16.440> pretty<00:04:16.680> and

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
taskmaster will get taken out pretty and

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.370 
taskmaster will get taken out pretty and
easily<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.519> well<00:04:17.940> as<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.539> word<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:18.959> really

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
easily as well as the word in really

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.439 
easily as well as the word in really
working<00:04:19.769> hard<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.400> try<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.729> get<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.269> level

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
working hard to try and get to level

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.629 
working hard to try and get to level
three<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.019> then<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.620> able<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.949> focus<00:04:23.279> down

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
three and then be able to focus down

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.519 
three and then be able to focus down
perhaps<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.360> number<00:04:24.659> of<00:04:24.779> fleeing<00:04:25.050> foot<00:04:25.349> then

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:25.529 
perhaps a number of fleeing foot then

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.820 
perhaps a number of fleeing foot then
the<00:04:25.949> problem<00:04:26.400> though

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the problem though

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.270 
the problem though
that<00:04:26.949> warden<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.460> currently<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.740> slowed

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
that warden is currently and just slowed

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.010 
that warden is currently and just slowed
so<00:04:30.520> won't<00:04:30.729> be<00:04:30.819> able<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.090> chase<00:04:31.270> down<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.509> many

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
so won't be able to chase down that many

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.050 
so won't be able to chase down that many
units<00:04:32.379> either<00:04:32.590> all<00:04:33.159> right<00:04:33.400> what's<00:04:33.639> happening

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
units either all right what's happening

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.119 
units either all right what's happening
next<00:04:34.210> Mountain<00:04:35.020> King<00:04:35.229> already<00:04:35.590> clearing<00:04:35.919> out

this creep camp here on Terra nest and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.770 
this creep camp here on Terra nest and
and<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.650> map<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:38.979> really<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:40.150> strong<00:04:40.539> for

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
and this map is really really strong for

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.230 
and this map is really really strong for
creeping<00:04:41.139> just<00:04:41.830> because<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.580> number<00:04:43.090> of

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
creeping just because of the number of

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
creeping just because of the number of
locations<00:04:43.659> there<00:04:44.080> are<00:04:44.199> two<00:04:44.319> creep<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.740> the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
locations there are two creep and the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.339 
locations there are two creep and the
fact<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:46.330> pretty<00:04:46.569> much<00:04:46.629> have<00:04:46.930> your<00:04:47.139> neck

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
fact that you pretty much have your neck

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.469 
fact that you pretty much have your neck
of<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.530> woods<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.009> so<00:04:48.430> does<00:04:48.639> your<00:04:48.879> opponent

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
of the woods and so does your opponent

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.350 
of the woods and so does your opponent
unless<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.169> cross<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:51.189> both<00:04:51.430> sets<00:04:51.759> of<00:04:51.909> bridges

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
unless you cross in both sets of bridges

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300 
unless you cross in both sets of bridges
there's<00:04:52.990> really<00:04:53.349> nothing<00:04:53.889> to<00:04:53.919> really<00:04:54.189> worry

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
there's really nothing to really worry

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.429 
there's really nothing to really worry
about<00:04:54.580> if<00:04:55.060> you're<00:04:55.150> trying<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:55.689> stay<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:56.110> your
