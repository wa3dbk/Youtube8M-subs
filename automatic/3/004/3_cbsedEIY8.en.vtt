now tip number two of free for all or
how<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.610> well<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.640> free<00:01:41.880> fall<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.119> guess<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
how to do well in free fall I guess is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.700 
how to do well in free fall I guess is
to<00:01:42.540> divide<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.950> maps<00:01:44.220> into<00:01:44.490> sections<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
to divide in your maps into sections and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.980 
to divide in your maps into sections and
stick<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.549> section<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.479> right

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
stick around that one section now right

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
stick around that one section now right
here<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.439> probably<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:50.009> section

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
here this is probably the best section

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
here this is probably the best section
on<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.829> only

playing a team-based you'll inject the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.790 
playing a team-based you'll inject the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
out of the other team probably not the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.690 
out of the other team probably not the
best<00:02:48.480> idea<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> ac-130<00:02:50.130> does<00:02:50.459> have

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
best idea because the ac-130 does have

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.260 
best idea because the ac-130 does have
the<00:02:51.050> stupid<00:02:52.050> stupid<00:02:52.230> reload<00:02:52.680> time<00:02:52.890> by<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the stupid stupid reload time by the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.560 
the stupid stupid reload time by the
real<00:02:54.450> time<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.959> there<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:56.280> prevent<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.450> from

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
real time is there to prevent it from

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.120 
real time is there to prevent it from
being<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.050> little<00:02:58.160> overpowered<00:02:59.160> but<00:03:00.709> again<00:03:01.709> my

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
being a little overpowered but again my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.740 
being a little overpowered but again my
choice<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.790> drop<00:03:02.970> later<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.510> wing

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
choice is the drop later you know wing

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.680 
choice is the drop later you know wing
choices<00:03:04.200> chopper<00:03:04.560> gunner<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.860> guess<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> why

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
choices chopper gunner I guess so why

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
choices chopper gunner I guess so why
not<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> trap<00:03:07.140> again<00:03:07.320> are<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.560> know<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.580> know

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
not the trap again are you know you know

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.030 
not the trap again are you know you know
give<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.120> chance<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.690> guys<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> fan

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
give it a chance of you guys are a fan

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
give it a chance of you guys are a fan

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
probably not the best idea because

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.390 
probably not the best idea because
people<00:03:15.600> walk<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.350> know<00:03:16.380> people<00:03:16.860> are<00:03:17.100> spinning

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400

around every way and you probably won't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.740
