00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
now maybe I'm just saying Trek might

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.730 
now maybe I'm just saying Trek might
have<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> plan<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> us<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.259> nitendo

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have a plan for all of us we you nitendo

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.960 
have a plan for all of us we you nitendo
all<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.939> us<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.210> unit<00:01:45.509> 1000<00:01:45.780> users<00:01:46.020> okay<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
all of us we unit 1000 users okay I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.940

think<00:01:47.970> I'm<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.110> saying<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.560> I'm<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
think I'm just saying this I'm just

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
think I'm just saying this I'm just
putting<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> think

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
putting this right out there I think

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
putting this right out there I think
Treyarch<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:53.479> taking<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.630> very<00:01:54.689> long<00:01:55.229> time

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.430 
that tram should really put the deals
the<00:02:43.590> out<00:02:43.740> there<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.370> now<00:02:45.080> they<00:02:46.080> should<00:02:46.110> at

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
the out there right now they should at
least<00:02:46.680> give<00:02:47.100> us<00:02:47.130> some<00:02:47.310> heads<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.970> where<00:02:48.270> the
