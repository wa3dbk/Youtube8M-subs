another person is gonna take place start
above<00:03:12.579> his<00:03:12.849> steps<00:03:13.180> under<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.019> precedent<00:03:14.500> of

above his steps under the precedent of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.229 
above his steps under the precedent of
top-rank<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.370> I'm<00:03:15.549> pretty<00:03:15.790> sure<00:03:15.940> he<00:03:16.120> has

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
top-rank and I'm pretty sure he has

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.420 
top-rank and I'm pretty sure he has
basically<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.870> same<00:03:17.019> views<00:03:17.379> as<00:03:17.650> Bob<00:03:17.889> Arum<00:03:18.190> at

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
basically the same views as Bob Arum at

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.680 
basically the same views as Bob Arum at
least<00:03:18.609> that's<00:03:18.730> what<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:18.879> think<00:03:19.000> he's<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
least that's what I think he's just a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.089 
least that's what I think he's just a
yeah<00:03:19.780> he's<00:03:20.019> basically<00:03:20.319> just<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.769> younger

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
yeah he's basically just a younger

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.159 
yeah he's basically just a younger
version<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.579> Bob<00:03:22.209> Arum<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.750> think<00:03:23.019> it's

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
version of Bob Arum but I think it's

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.449 
version of Bob Arum but I think it's
more<00:03:23.379> peace<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.669> would<00:03:25.299> say<00:03:26.250> he's<00:03:27.250> more

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
more peace more I would say he's more

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.890 
more peace more I would say he's more
open<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.849> guess<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.180> don't<00:03:28.329> think<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.660> really

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
open I guess I don't think it's really

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.470 
open I guess I don't think it's really
that<00:03:29.129> that<00:03:30.129> Bob<00:03:30.489> Arum<00:03:30.730> s<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.239> know<00:03:31.329> what<00:03:31.419> I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
that that Bob Arum s you know what I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.300 
that that Bob Arum s you know what I
mean<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.810> he's<00:03:31.959> not<00:03:32.139> really<00:03:32.169> like<00:03:32.680> Bob<00:03:33.040> Arum

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
mean like he's not really like Bob Arum

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.599 
mean like he's not really like Bob Arum
but<00:03:33.579> he<00:03:34.060> definitely<00:03:34.269> has<00:03:34.599> some

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
but he definitely has some

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.939 
but he definitely has some
characteristics<00:03:36.609> of<00:03:36.730> Bob<00:03:36.940> Arum<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.930> once<00:03:38.680> Bob
