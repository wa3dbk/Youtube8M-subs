00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
chocolate than too much because you can

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.119 
chocolate than too much because you can
always<00:01:01.600> go<00:01:01.870> back<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.230> add<00:01:02.409> a<00:01:02.440> little<00:01:02.589> bit<00:01:02.890> but

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
if it's too much chocolate it's a lot

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.550 
if it's too much chocolate it's a lot
harder<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.740> take<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.550> out<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.970> put<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.210> in<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.230> I

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
harder to take it out and put it in so I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.109 
harder to take it out and put it in so I
have<00:01:08.860> put<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.340> chocolate<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.090> bottom

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
have put the chocolate on the bottom

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.789 
have put the chocolate on the bottom
first<00:01:10.750> then<00:01:10.930> I'm<00:01:11.170> going<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.350> insert<00:01:11.680> my

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
first then I'm going to insert my

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.130 
first then I'm going to insert my
lollipop<00:01:12.399> stick<00:01:12.670> right<00:01:12.880> here<00:01:12.909> if<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.840> put<00:01:14.049> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140

lollipop stick in last or first then it

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.139 
lollipop stick in last or first then it
causes<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> chocolate<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.280> smudge<00:01:18.670> all<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
causes the chocolate to smudge all the

causes the chocolate to smudge all the
way<00:01:19.240> down<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.630> bottom<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.290> just<00:01:20.560> makes

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
way down the bottom and this just makes

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.190 
way down the bottom and this just makes
it<00:01:20.950> neater<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:22.360> going<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.540> put<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.689> little<00:01:22.960> bit

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200

and<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.450> doesn't<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.080> completely

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260
