camcorders and most webcams have pretty
good<00:02:34.630> sound<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.410> definitely<00:02:35.950> check<00:02:36.310> with

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
they have pretty good sound because I've

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.390 
they have pretty good sound because I've
watched<00:02:41.350> some<00:02:41.500> videos<00:02:41.770> where<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.220> hard

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
watched some videos where it's so hard

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.740 
watched some videos where it's so hard
to<00:02:42.520> hear<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> person<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.270> turn<00:02:43.600> my

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
to hear the person I have to turn my

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.240 
to hear the person I have to turn my
volume<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.110> all<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.530> way<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.950> hear<00:02:45.100> them

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
volume up all the way just to hear them

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.860 
volume up all the way just to hear them
and<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.790> still<00:02:45.970> kind<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.180> crackly<00:02:46.660> and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
and it's still kind of crackly and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870 
and it's still kind of crackly and
usually<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.800> exit<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.280> those<00:02:48.430> videos<00:02:48.760> not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
usually I exit out of those videos not

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.770 
usually I exit out of those videos not
because<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.150> don't<00:02:49.270> want<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> hear<00:02:49.570> what<00:02:49.690> they

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
because I don't want to hear what they

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.090 
because I don't want to hear what they
have<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.900> say<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.290> purely<00:02:50.650> because<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:50.890> can't

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
have to say but purely because I can't

really<00:02:51.220> hear<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.550> definitely<00:02:52.000> double-check

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
really hear it definitely double-check

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
really hear it definitely double-check
your<00:02:52.540> sound<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.050> think<00:02:53.140> most<00:02:53.500> cameras<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.070> most

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
your sound I think most cameras and most

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.130 
your sound I think most cameras and most
webcams<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.060> camcorders<00:02:55.450> everything<00:02:55.870> are

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
webcams and camcorders everything are

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.200 
webcams and camcorders everything are
capable<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.340> having<00:02:57.460> really<00:02:57.790> good<00:02:57.880> sound<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
capable of having really good sound and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.550 
capable of having really good sound and
naturally<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.750> good<00:02:58.900> sound<00:02:59.110> but<00:02:59.320> just

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
naturally have good sound but just

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.990 
naturally have good sound but just
double-check<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.160> third<00:03:00.490> thing<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.760> want<00:03:00.940> to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
double-check that third thing I want to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.310 
double-check that third thing I want to
talk<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.300> guys<00:03:01.390> about<00:03:01.510> something<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.080> kind

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
talk to you guys about something I kind

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.260 
talk to you guys about something I kind
of<00:03:02.350> already<00:03:02.500> touched<00:03:02.830> on<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:04.120> idea

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
of already touched on but it's this idea

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.870 
of already touched on but it's this idea
of<00:03:04.660> needing<00:03:04.870> an<00:03:05.170> HD<00:03:05.590> camera<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.250> many<00:03:06.460> people<00:03:06.730> I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
of needing an HD camera so many people I

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.050 
of needing an HD camera so many people I
think<00:03:06.910> assumed<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.110> they<00:03:08.230> need<00:03:08.680> HD<00:03:09.490> quality

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
think assumed that they need HD quality

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.370 
think assumed that they need HD quality
for<00:03:10.270> their<00:03:10.360> videos<00:03:10.660> in<00:03:10.690> order<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.170> post

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
for their videos in order to post

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.350 
for their videos in order to post
anything<00:03:11.740> it's<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.580> not<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.910> truth<00:03:13.120> there

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
anything it's just not the truth there

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.060
