00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's kinda i'm kind of skeptical about
this<00:01:46.409> idea<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
this idea i don't know if this is a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.020 
this idea i don't know if this is a
really<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> good<00:01:48.930> idea<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.100> can't<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.729> too

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
really a good idea but I can't make too

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.340 
really a good idea but I can't make too
many<00:01:51.119> assumptions<00:01:51.509> or<00:01:51.780> too<00:01:51.930> many<00:01:52.079> judgments

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
many assumptions or too many judgments

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.450 
many assumptions or too many judgments
because<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.310> hasn't<00:01:53.909> come<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.720> yet<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> my

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
because it hasn't come out yet so my

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
because it hasn't come out yet so my
other<00:01:56.670> question<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> wanted<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> ask<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
other question that I wanted to ask that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
other question that I wanted to ask that
was<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> update<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.340> here's<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> question

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
was the update and here's the question

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.109 
was the update and here's the question
um<00:02:00.380> with<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> newest<00:02:02.100> exam<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:02.790> come<00:02:03.090> out

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
uh how hard do you think it is so far on

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.160 
uh how hard do you think it is so far on
hard<00:02:07.290> mode<00:02:07.399> how<00:02:08.399> far<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.869> guys

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
hard mode how far have you guys

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
hard mode how far have you guys
completed<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.039> exam

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
completed the exam

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.590 
completed the exam
and<00:02:11.930> um<00:02:13.340> do<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.400> guys<00:02:14.490> hope<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.060> stage<00:02:15.300> five

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and um do you guys hope that stage five

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.310 
and um do you guys hope that stage five
and<00:02:15.810> six<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.320> harder<00:02:16.710> or<00:02:16.950> easier<00:02:18.320> than

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
and six will be harder or easier than

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.410 
and six will be harder or easier than
the<00:02:19.590> previous<00:02:19.980> four<00:02:20.220> exams<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.880> personally

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the previous four exams I personally

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.550 
the previous four exams I personally
think<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.080> exam<00:02:22.470> has<00:02:22.590> been<00:02:23.210> kinda<00:02:24.210> easy<00:02:24.560> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
think the exam has been kinda easy a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.110 
think the exam has been kinda easy a
little<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.490> little<00:02:26.820> almost<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.300> little<00:02:27.420> too<00:02:27.570> easy

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
little a little almost a little too easy

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.670 
little a little almost a little too easy
because<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.570> passed<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.230> all<00:02:31.410> six

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
because I have passed it on all six

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.790 
because I have passed it on all six
manager<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.160> far<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.820> hard<00:02:33.330> mode<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.020> my

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
manager so far on hard mode and my

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920
