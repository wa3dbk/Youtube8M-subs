00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hey you guys, you're beauty. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.429
 daemon and here we'll make one more 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:14.429
 car game indication and even 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 which browser game you do not need 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.990
 download and install nor tried to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 head and then with the game right because if 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 know who is going to play in which you download 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.770
 How are you going to be there? 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.230
 computer is very suspicious 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 I already did so I went through this is a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.079
 game I thought I went to install led 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 an Indian Windows file and a 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.100
 business that finally restore the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 link of this game is down I am going to a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 play is a racing game and and in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.280
 2 t two dimensions 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.610
 It's a really cool game because it 's not much 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:20.390
 with the highly powerful graphics but 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 takes into account the gameplay and the way 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:32.040
 how game control is developed 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 why many game developers 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.740
 in flash face leaves an accessible game of 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 May sometimes leaving does not leave much 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.119
 sensitive person said he is not sensitive 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.899
 Too much if I 'm here to get the hang of it 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:57.240
 it was time, there was a dying battle still 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:00.450
 so I 'll play one more time to see 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 If I improved the game 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.149
 the link this game is low of the video and in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.319
 description 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:13.489
 Whoever wants it is very nice. 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:20.959
 plays with the arrows 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:22.400
 I think that not to stay in 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.700
 last 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.109
 I have to, I do not have to hit you. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.469
 do not have to beat that same 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:34.459
 principle that is applied to 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:37.129
 formula 1 if you do not know the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.169
 the guys who already run the car 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.010
 formula 1 if you do not know the suffocation 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:45.109
 You think this game can play 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.569
 for you to see how interesting it is 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:51.409
 time you hit no obstacle if you 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.879
 You lose more, you can not beat 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.250
 all that if you hit you will lose 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.650
 time the question of this guy 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.189
 front of the other the question of thousandths 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.139
