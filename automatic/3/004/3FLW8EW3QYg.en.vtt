defective wire when you have found the
broken<00:02:28.050> wire<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.920> repair<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.730> this

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
broken wire you repair it like this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.900 
broken wire you repair it like this
sometimes<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.340> enough<00:02:32.670> wire

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
sometimes there is not enough wire

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.120 
sometimes there is not enough wire
length<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.420> working<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.709> need<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.010> add

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
length for working then you need to add

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.380 
length for working then you need to add
a<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.430> extra<00:02:35.940> wire<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.540> another<00:02:36.900> coupler
