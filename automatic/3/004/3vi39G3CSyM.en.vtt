00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.470 
about the single-pole double-throw relay
as<00:00:10.820> you<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:12.059> see<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:14.210> relay<00:00:15.210> over

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
as you can see here I have relay over

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.370 
as you can see here I have relay over
here<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.020> DC<00:00:16.740> fan<00:00:16.770> connected<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.869> top<00:00:19.109> pin

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
here a DC fan connected to the top pin

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.519 
here a DC fan connected to the top pin
and<00:00:19.910> another<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.539> already<00:00:22.199> spinning

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and another one that is already spinning

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.779 
and another one that is already spinning
on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> bottom<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.630> relay<00:00:25.109> has

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
on the bottom one this relay has

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.120 
on the bottom one this relay has
normally<00:00:26.789> closed<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.480> contact<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.859> one

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
normally closed to contact on this one

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.999 
normally closed to contact on this one
so<00:00:29.789> without<00:00:30.210> power<00:00:30.599> supply<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.800> see

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so without power supply as you can see

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.780 
so without power supply as you can see
zero<00:00:32.550> volts<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:34.320> contact<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.610> this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
zero volts this contact from this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.740 
zero volts this contact from this
terminal<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> contact<00:00:38.750> pro

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
terminal to this to this contact pro

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
terminal to this to this contact pro
allows<00:00:40.430> current<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:42.110> flow<00:00:43.110> directly<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
allows current to flow directly to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
allows current to flow directly to the
DC<00:00:44.700> fan<00:00:45.770> as<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.329> other

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
DC fan as you can see and the the other

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
DC fan as you can see and the the other
one<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> connected<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> other

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
one is connected to do to the other

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
one is connected to do to the other
contact<00:00:52.170> pin<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.629> opened<00:00:55.230> right

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
contact pin and this one is opened right

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.000 
contact pin and this one is opened right
now<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.820> cannot<00:00:57.210> provide<00:00:57.629> current<00:00:58.440> through

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
now so it cannot provide current through

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
now so it cannot provide current through
this<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.260> turn<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.600> power

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
this one now I will turn on the power

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.299 
this one now I will turn on the power
supply

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
supply

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.840 
supply
providing<00:01:05.309> 12<00:01:05.700> volts<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.979> coil<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
providing 12 volts to the coil and now I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
providing 12 volts to the coil and now I
think<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> bottom<00:01:10.409> one

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
think as you can see the bottom one

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.320 
think as you can see the bottom one
stopped<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.210> top<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:13.340> started<00:01:14.340> spinning

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.990 

this<00:01:18.330> happened<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
this happened because because now the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
this happened because because now the
this<00:01:21.000> terminal<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.630> connected<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.530> pin

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this terminal is connected to this pin

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.210 
this terminal is connected to this pin
and<00:01:23.689> now<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> current<00:01:25.200> flows<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and now the current flows through this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
and now the current flows through this
one<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:28.220> close<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.880> power<00:01:30.119> supply<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
one as I close the power supply as it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
one as I close the power supply as it
turn<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> bottom

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
turn it off you will see that the bottom

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.920 
turn it off you will see that the bottom
one<00:01:34.400> started<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.549> spin<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> above<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
one started to spin and the above and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.550 
one started to spin and the above and
the<00:01:37.170> top<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:38.280> stopped<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.409> can

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the top one has stopped so as you can

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.179 
the top one has stopped so as you can
see<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> single-pole<00:01:41.970> double-throw<00:01:42.110> relay

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
see the single-pole double-throw relay

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.719 
see the single-pole double-throw relay
is<00:01:44.189> quite<00:01:45.180> interesting<00:01:46.100> there<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.280> various

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
is quite interesting there are various

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.630 
is quite interesting there are various
scenarios<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.700> use<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.010 

so<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:56.240> hope<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.289> enjoy<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.719> by<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.780> way
