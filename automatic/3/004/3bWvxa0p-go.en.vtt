know<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> comet<00:01:37.320> hit<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.670> we'd<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> put<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
know a comet hit it we'd have to put the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.429 
know a comet hit it we'd have to put the
pieces<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.520> one's<00:01:41.729> kind<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
pieces back on there this one's kind of

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
pieces back on there this one's kind of
different<00:01:43.439> angles<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.340> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> cool

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
different angles so that's kind of cool

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.940 
different angles so that's kind of cool
that's<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> one

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
that's what I like this one

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.370 
that's what I like this one

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
for us we can go to go back we could

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.819 
for us we can go to go back we could
choose<00:01:50.630> one<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:50.869> on<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.409> earth<00:01:51.560> actually
