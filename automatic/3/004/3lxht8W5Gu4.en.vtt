Google Copic airbrush spelled like that
see<00:00:30.390> OPI<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> way<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> works<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
see OPI see and the way it works is you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
see OPI see and the way it works is you
can<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.290> hook<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.550> air

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
can actually hook this up to an air

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.959 
can actually hook this up to an air
compressor<00:00:35.960> like<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.430> also<00:00:38.579> sell

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
compressor like I have or they also sell

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.130 
compressor like I have or they also sell
the<00:00:39.719> air<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> want

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and this is how it works

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.240 
and this is how it works
