00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
side is the through hole for the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.210 
side is the through hole for the
transducer<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.440> only<00:01:52.590> point<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.070> out

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
transducer and I only point that out

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.410 
transducer and I only point that out
because<00:01:53.400> it's<00:01:53.729> another<00:01:53.940> through-hole

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
because it's another through-hole

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
because it's another through-hole
fitting<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.140> easy<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.790> oil

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
fitting but it's easy to see now the oil

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
fitting but it's easy to see now the oil
filter<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> little<00:01:57.840> inaccessible<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.740> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
filter is a little inaccessible so this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
filter is a little inaccessible so this
would<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> good<00:01:59.340> application<00:01:59.490> for<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> remote

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
would be a good application for a remote

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
would be a good application for a remote
oil<00:02:00.750> change<00:02:01.140> system<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:02.280> happy<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
oil change system I'm happy to see that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
oil change system I'm happy to see that
there's<00:02:03.150> not<00:02:03.300> one<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.750> two<00:02:04.050> fire<00:02:04.380> suppression

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there's not one but two fire suppression

there's not one but two fire suppression

last<00:02:07.650> thing<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.010> to<00:02:08.070> check<00:02:08.220> out<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.549> the

last thing I want to check out is the
sound<00:02:08.910> levels<00:02:09.299> I'll<00:02:09.450> start<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> engine<00:02:10.080> with

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sound levels I'll start the engine with

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
sound levels I'll start the engine with
the<00:02:10.200> hatch<00:02:10.380> open<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:11.220> we'll<00:02:11.310> measure<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the hatch open and then we'll measure it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.820 
the hatch open and then we'll measure it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.230 
with you right now is 69 70 71 decibels
and<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> engine<00:02:21.690> running

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.060 

with<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> engine<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.380> idle<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.830> hatch

with the engine at idle in the hatch

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.090 
with the engine at idle in the hatch
open<00:02:27.520> I'm<00:02:27.910> measuring<00:02:28.240> an<00:02:28.480> average<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.140> 74

decibels

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370

now with the engine at idle and the
hatch<00:02:36.720> closed<00:02:37.110> I'm<00:02:37.380> measuring<00:02:37.680> an<00:02:37.950> average<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
hatch closed I'm measuring an average of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.080 
hatch closed I'm measuring an average of
62<00:02:38.880> 63<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.770> full<00:02:40.950> 10<00:02:41.220> decibels<00:02:41.580> lower

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
62 63 so that's a full 10 decibels lower

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.530 
62 63 so that's a full 10 decibels lower

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.950 
opinion bennetto's design of the engine
compartment<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.610> intuitive<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.270> practical

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
compartment is intuitive and practical
