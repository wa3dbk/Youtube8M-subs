rod your aileron control surfaces have a
I<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:45.230> say<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:46.060> pretty<00:02:47.060> sturdy<00:02:47.389> control

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
I would say like a pretty sturdy control

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.920 
I would say like a pretty sturdy control
horn<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:48.709> cool<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.060> EDF<00:02:50.660> hatch

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
horn so that's really cool the EDF hatch

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.780 
horn so that's really cool the EDF hatch
right<00:02:51.139> here<00:02:51.349> it's<00:02:51.530> screwed<00:02:51.799> on<00:02:51.919> so<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.639> can

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
right here it's screwed on so that can

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.490 
right here it's screwed on so that can
be<00:02:52.819> screwed<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:53.630> taken<00:02:53.930> out<00:02:54.049> if<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.380> ever

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
be screwed off and taken out if you ever

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.050 
be screwed off and taken out if you ever
need<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.709> maintenance<00:02:55.099> or<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.730> you're<00:02:55.849> ready<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
need a maintenance or if you're ready to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.970 
need a maintenance or if you're ready to
do<00:02:56.239> some<00:02:56.450> maintenance<00:02:56.599> on<00:02:56.959> your<00:02:56.989> EDF<00:02:57.590> system

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
do some maintenance on your EDF system

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.860 
do some maintenance on your EDF system
or<00:02:58.099> on<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> motor<00:02:58.700> okay<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.419> I'm<00:02:59.599> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> go

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
or on the motor okay so I'm going to go

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.330 
or on the motor okay so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.079> take<00:03:00.260> off<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.560> canopy<00:03:00.859> cover<00:03:01.160> so

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
ahead and take off the canopy cover so

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.089 
ahead and take off the canopy cover so
you<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.579> look<00:03:01.700> inside<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:03.739> we<00:03:03.889> take<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
you can look inside and if we take a

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.879 
you can look inside and if we take a
look<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.400> here<00:03:04.579> we<00:03:04.639> have<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> 20<00:03:05.389> amp<00:03:05.569> ESC<00:03:06.290> that's

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
look in here we have a 20 amp ESC that's

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.440 
look in here we have a 20 amp ESC that's
going<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.099> be<00:03:07.190> powering<00:03:07.579> your<00:03:07.609> 50<00:03:08.060> millimeter

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
going to be powering your 50 millimeter

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.729 
going to be powering your 50 millimeter
EDF<00:03:08.930> system<00:03:09.349> okay

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
EDF system okay

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.990 
EDF system okay
so<00:03:10.099> then<00:03:10.280> we<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:11.359> gyro<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:11.959> well<00:03:12.169> and<00:03:13.000> my

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
so then we have the gyro as well and my

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.789 
so then we have the gyro as well and my
receiver<00:03:14.389> that<00:03:14.569> we'll<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.780> using<00:03:14.930> today<00:03:15.169> the

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
receiver that we'll be using today the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.559 
receiver that we'll be using today the
gyro<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.370> two<00:03:16.519> axis<00:03:16.910> system<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.389> help

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
gyro is the two axis system to help

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.970 
gyro is the two axis system to help
stabilize<00:03:17.810> your<00:03:18.200> Aylor<00:03:18.560> aileron<00:03:18.950> and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
stabilize your Aylor aileron and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.849 
stabilize your Aylor aileron and
elevator<00:03:19.220> setup<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.299> that's<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.930> good

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
elevator setup so that's really good

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:38.610 
elevator setup so that's really good
I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.209> about<00:03:23.359> wraps<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.810> up

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:54.640 

you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.039 

all<00:03:55.310> right<00:03:55.459> we<00:03:55.670> got<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.030> rudders<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
all right we got the rudders the

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.990 
all right we got the rudders the
ailerons<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.860> elevators<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.549> this

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
ailerons and the elevators and this

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.630 
ailerons and the elevators and this
small<00:03:59.329> little<00:03:59.510> unit<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:01.010> are<00:04:01.129> several<00:04:01.400> key

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
small little unit there are several key

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.009 
small little unit there are several key
points<00:04:01.849> about<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.420> want<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.720> point<00:04:02.840> out

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
points about it that I want to point out

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.500 
points about it that I want to point out
and<00:04:03.230> let's<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.040> start<00:04:04.280> off<00:04:04.430> we're<00:04:05.150> going<00:04:05.450> to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
and let's you start off we're going to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.750 
and let's you start off we're going to
