when<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.030> want<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.420> assess<00:00:35.809> how<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.379> global

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.830 

we<00:00:42.380> asked<00:00:43.310> that<00:00:43.400> very<00:00:43.460> simple<00:00:44.060> question<00:00:44.570> where

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
we asked that very simple question where

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.530 
we asked that very simple question where
are<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.140> now<00:00:45.430> relative<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.940> baseline<00:00:47.270> that

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
are we now relative to a baseline that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.320 
are we now relative to a baseline that
we<00:00:47.840> set<00:00:48.200> around<00:00:48.470> 1950<00:00:49.340> because<00:00:49.490> large-scale

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.880 
we set around 1950 because large-scale
industrial<00:00:50.840> fishing<00:00:51.080> started<00:00:51.650> around<00:00:51.860> 1950

industrial fishing started around 1950

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.370 
industrial fishing started around 1950
so<00:00:54.890> here<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.190> 1952<00:00:56.090> when<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.330> series<00:00:56.900> starts

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
so here in 1952 when the series starts

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.800 
so here in 1952 when the series starts
we<00:00:57.590> see<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:57.980> around<00:00:58.400> Japan<00:00:58.910> there's<00:00:59.510> already

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
we see that around Japan there's already

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.319 

and<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.869> see<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:06.219> fishery<00:02:06.789> has<00:02:06.969> reached

and you see that the fishery has reached

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.619 
and you see that the fishery has reached
a<00:02:07.600> truly<00:02:08.259> global<00:02:08.530> coverage<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:10.149> lot<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.360> the
