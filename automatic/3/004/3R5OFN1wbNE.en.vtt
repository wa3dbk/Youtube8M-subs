00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.510
 we almost always make one like 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
 a tension between two characters can 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.800
 be a positive or negative attention or 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.740
 it can be a fight an argument or a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 happiness in this case is an attention 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 more than everything as peace they are like 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.120
 very calm relaxed sitting but 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.140
 everything around has many speeds 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.300
 surveyed in geometric question does not have 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.630
 has a lot of metric figuration at 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.630
 background 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.649
 and they are divided by a mandala 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.019
 what we wanted with this mandala was 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.359
 how to have space a lime space 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.430
 white where all the energies are 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.550
 as of the two characters that were 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.790
 sitting looking is more than anything a 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.670
 question as of symmetries of a 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.799
 story between two people are not very 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 Human always always most 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.690
 Sometimes we use them with masks 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.180
 to hide his identity because since the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.750
 graffiti is very sometimes to maintain the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.750
 anonymity 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.970
 the figures they have on their faces 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.420
 and on their masks are pre-Columbian 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.910
 we like to base many of these 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.690
 engravings or details of programs and 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.140
 sewn and woven 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.140
 and tell us
