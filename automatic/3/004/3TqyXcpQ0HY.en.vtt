00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.880 

so<00:00:01.020> look<00:00:01.589> at<00:00:01.709> here's<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.750> two<00:00:03.750> responses

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
so look at here's the two responses

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.240 
so look at here's the two responses
I<00:00:05.569> guess<00:00:06.569> reflexes<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.410> are<00:00:07.560> wired<00:00:07.799> into<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
I guess reflexes that are wired into the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.160 
I guess reflexes that are wired into the
muscles<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.170> monosynaptic

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
muscles one is the the monosynaptic

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.980 
muscles one is the the monosynaptic
stretch<00:00:13.799> reflex<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:17.180> gets<00:00:18.180> mediated<00:00:18.810> by

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stretch reflex which is gets mediated by

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
stretch reflex which is gets mediated by
the<00:00:19.050> muscle<00:00:19.619> spindles<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> one

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the muscle spindles so this is the one

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
the muscle spindles so this is the one
we<00:00:21.630> win<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> muscle<00:00:22.260> lengthens<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we win the muscle lengthens and the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.560 
we win the muscle lengthens and the
belly<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.850> muscle<00:00:23.939> you've<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
belly of the muscle you've got the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.990 
belly of the muscle you've got the
muscle<00:00:24.869> spindles<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:26.070> detect<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
muscle spindles and and they detect that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.080 
muscle spindles and and they detect that
rate<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> change<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.529> length<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.760> fire

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
rate of change in length and they fire

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.920 
rate of change in length and they fire
off<00:00:30.650> signals<00:00:31.759> accordingly<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
off signals accordingly so if we have a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.770 
off signals accordingly so if we have a
look<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:35.700> muscle<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> being<00:00:36.420> stretched

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
look here this muscle is being stretched

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.690 
look here this muscle is being stretched
and<00:00:37.129> as<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> result<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.790> firing<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.390> signals

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
and as a result it's firing off signals

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
and as a result it's firing off signals
and<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> causing<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:43.040> contraction<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:45.260> in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and it's causing a contraction in the in

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
and it's causing a contraction in the in
the<00:00:46.500> muscle<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.730> doing<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the muscle so what it's doing is it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.670 
the muscle so what it's doing is it's
actually<00:00:48.329> trying<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> maintain<00:00:49.230> its<00:00:49.440> length

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
actually trying to maintain its length

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually trying to maintain its length
and<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> those<00:00:50.520> protective

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and this is one of those protective

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
and this is one of those protective
mechanisms<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.079> Kevin<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> end<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mechanisms so Kevin look at the end the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
mechanisms so Kevin look at the end the
muscles<00:00:53.579> being<00:00:53.789> stretched<00:00:54.149> those<00:00:54.809> muscle

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
muscles being stretched those muscle

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520 
muscles being stretched those muscle
spindles<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.739> being<00:00:56.190> stretched<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.530> go

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
spindles are being stretched and they go

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
spindles are being stretched and they go
and<00:00:58.829> tell<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.449> muscle<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> contract<00:01:02.120> now

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and tell that muscle to contract now

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
and tell that muscle to contract now
obviously<00:01:03.539> they'll<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.870> voluntary<00:01:04.860> messages

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
obviously they'll be voluntary messages

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.660 
obviously they'll be voluntary messages
overlaid<00:01:06.439> from<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> nervous<00:01:08.250> system<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
overlaid from the nervous system the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
overlaid from the nervous system the
central<00:01:09.000> nervous<00:01:09.119> system<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> tell<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
central nervous system to tell the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
central nervous system to tell the
muscle<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> continue<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> lengthen<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
muscle to continue to lengthen and a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
muscle to continue to lengthen and a
normal<00:01:12.630> contraction<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.680> instance<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.070> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
normal contraction so for instance if we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.730 
normal contraction so for instance if we
were<00:01:14.340> lowering<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.150> weight<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> barbell

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
were lowering the weight on a barbell

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.480 
were lowering the weight on a barbell
cool<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.119> were<00:01:18.240> lowering<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.490> we

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
cool if we were lowering it down then we

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
cool if we were lowering it down then we
will<00:01:20.520> continue<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> let<00:01:21.390> their<00:01:21.540> muscle

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
will continue to let their muscle

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.230 
will continue to let their muscle
lengthen<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.580> always<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
lengthen but there is always this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.289 
lengthen but there is always this
feedback<00:01:24.869> loop<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.090> which<00:01:27.090> will

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
feedback loop going on which will

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
feedback loop going on which will
control<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> rate<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> lengthening<00:01:30.829> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
control the rate of lengthening so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.310 
control the rate of lengthening so
that's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:33.020> muscle<00:01:34.250> spindles<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.579> action<00:01:36.570> if

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's the muscle spindles in action if

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's the muscle spindles in action if
we<00:01:37.500> look<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> Golgi<00:01:38.310> tendon<00:01:38.340> organ<00:01:40.189> what's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
we look at the Golgi tendon organ what's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.270 
we look at the Golgi tendon organ what's
happening<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.540> there's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
happening here is if there's a lot of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
happening here is if there's a lot of
nerve<00:01:44.280> assistant<00:01:44.970> fire<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
nerve assistant fire and going into that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
nerve assistant fire and going into that
muscle<00:01:47.630> obviously<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> muscle<00:01:49.200> would

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
muscle obviously the muscle would

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
muscle obviously the muscle would
produce<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.009> heck<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.970> force<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
produce a heck of a lot of force and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
produce a heck of a lot of force and
that<00:01:52.079> force<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.770> always<00:01:53.250> transferred<00:01:54.030> through

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that force is always transferred through

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.889 
that force is always transferred through
the<00:01:54.420> tendon<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.750> old

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the tendon there now as we know the old

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
the tendon there now as we know the old
Gogi<00:01:58.619> tendon<00:01:59.009> organs<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> whole

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
Gogi tendon organs don't like a whole

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.160 
Gogi tendon organs don't like a whole
lot<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> force<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.479> they

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
lot of force and what they do is they

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.210 
lot of force and what they do is they
fire<00:02:04.560> off<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.219> signal<00:02:05.899> for<00:02:06.899> inhibitory<00:02:07.619> neuron

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fire off a signal for inhibitory neuron

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.369 
fire off a signal for inhibitory neuron
to<00:02:08.399> neuron<00:02:08.450> which<00:02:09.450> means<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.170> will

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to neuron which means that they will

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.710 
to neuron which means that they will
tell<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
tell the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470 
tell the
muscle<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.200> stop<00:02:13.410> firing<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
muscle to stop firing so if we have a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.470 
muscle to stop firing so if we have a
look<00:02:15.660> at<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.870> again<00:02:16.220> here's<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.400> first<00:02:17.790> burg

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
look at that again here's the first burg

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
look at that again here's the first burg
firing<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.320> force<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.740> comes<00:02:20.070> down<00:02:20.340> there's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
firing a force that comes down there's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.220 
firing a force that comes down there's
actually<00:02:20.910> too<00:02:21.090> much<00:02:21.240> force<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> muscle

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
actually too much force in the muscle

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.980 
actually too much force in the muscle
the<00:02:22.980> t<00:02:23.190> Golgi<00:02:23.670> tendon<00:02:23.700> organ<00:02:24.330> has<00:02:24.450> detected

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
the t Golgi tendon organ has detected

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.290 
the t Golgi tendon organ has detected
that<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.380> ascending<00:02:25.980> signals<00:02:26.430> back<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.950> this

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
that and ascending signals back to this

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.180 
that and ascending signals back to this
inhibitory<00:02:30.300> interneuron<00:02:31.050> which<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
inhibitory interneuron which is going to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.400 
inhibitory interneuron which is going to
cause<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.910> shutdown<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.690> contractions

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
cause the shutdown of this contractions

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.100 
cause the shutdown of this contractions
to<00:02:34.890> reduce<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.430> force<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.660> let's<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.020> look

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
to reduce the force so let's have a look

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.080 
to reduce the force so let's have a look
at<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.620> again<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:38.550> get<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.880> initial

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
at that again we get that initial

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.390 
at that again we get that initial
contraction<00:02:39.870> which<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.200> too<00:02:40.440> much<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.130> goalie

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
contraction which is too much the goalie

a<00:02:58.230> bench<00:02:58.470> press<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.190> they're<00:02:59.880> right<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
a bench press and they're right at the

end of the set and they're absolute it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.090

and there's a lot of teaching a lot of
force<00:03:05.400> within<00:03:05.940> their<00:03:06.180> muscle<00:03:06.570> belly<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.020> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
force within their muscle belly and and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.770 
force within their muscle belly and and
the<00:03:07.560> pectorals<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> chest<00:03:08.630> they<00:03:09.630> will

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the pectorals and the chest they will

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.350 
the pectorals and the chest they will
sometimes<00:03:10.080> get<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.800> happening<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.730> what

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
sometimes get this happening and what

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.680 
sometimes get this happening and what
happens<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.830> Reese<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:15.000> reflex

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
happens is that this Reese this reflex

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.650 
happens is that this Reese this reflex
shuts<00:03:16.290> off<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> peak<00:03:16.950> muscles<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.450> course

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
shuts off the peak muscles and of course

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.940 
shuts off the peak muscles and of course
if<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:18.930> doing<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.200> bench<00:03:19.410> press<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
if you're doing a bench press and the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.680 
if you're doing a bench press and the
bars<00:03:20.130> above<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.910> you're<00:03:21.060> about<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.330> wreck

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
bars above you and you're about to wreck

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.830 
bars above you and you're about to wreck
it<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:23.010> those<00:03:23.580> might<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.120> peak<00:03:24.480> muscle

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it and those might and that peak muscle

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.140 
it and those might and that peak muscle
shuts<00:03:25.140> off<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:26.310> bar<00:03:26.519> comes<00:03:26.790> straight<00:03:27.090> back

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
shuts off the bar comes straight back

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.000 
shuts off the bar comes straight back
down<00:03:27.510> towards<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.080> pretty<00:03:28.320> quickly<00:03:28.590> as<00:03:28.800> well

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
down towards you pretty quickly as well

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640 
down towards you pretty quickly as well
so<00:03:29.570> what<00:03:30.570> you'll<00:03:30.690> see<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.200> people<00:03:31.470> who

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so what you'll see there is people who

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.800 
so what you'll see there is people who
are<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:31.980> struggling<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.810> particularly

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
are really struggling and particularly

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.150 
are really struggling and particularly
if<00:03:34.019> they're<00:03:34.200> lifting<00:03:34.500> weights<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:35.070> are

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
if they're lifting weights that are

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.370 
if they're lifting weights that are
really<00:03:35.400> outside<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.880> what<00:03:36.420> their<00:03:36.600> reflexes

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
really outside of what their reflexes

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.320 
really outside of what their reflexes
are<00:03:37.530> used<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.890> what<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> Goldi<00:03:38.610> tendons<00:03:39.030> are

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
are used to what the Goldi tendons are

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.199 
are used to what the Goldi tendons are
used<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:40.130> they<00:03:41.130> can't<00:03:41.400> actually<00:03:41.549> end<00:03:41.820> up<00:03:42.000> with

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
used to they can't actually end up with

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.870 
used to they can't actually end up with
that<00:03:42.650> they're<00:03:43.650> dropping<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.280> weight<00:03:44.549> back

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
that they're dropping of the weight back

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.320 
that they're dropping of the weight back
onto<00:03:45.090> them<00:03:48.860> quite<00:03:49.860> useful<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.120> you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
onto them quite useful because if you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.300 
onto them quite useful because if you
think<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.780> other<00:03:51.900> option<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.739> actually

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
think of the other option as is actually

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.979 
think of the other option as is actually
the<00:03:53.459> tendons<00:03:53.850> getting<00:03:54.120> pulled<00:03:54.420> off<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> bones

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
the tendons getting pulled off the bones

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.460 
the tendons getting pulled off the bones
now<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:57.269> been<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.780> gym<00:03:57.959> before<00:03:58.110> where

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
now I have been in the gym before where

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.110 
now I have been in the gym before where
I've<00:03:58.590> seen<00:03:58.830> someone<00:03:59.160> tear<00:03:59.610> their<00:03:59.820> pick

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
I've seen someone tear their pick

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.680 
I've seen someone tear their pick
straight<00:04:00.930> off<00:04:01.049> they're<00:04:01.380> off<00:04:01.920> their<00:04:02.370> bone<00:04:02.690> so

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
straight off they're off their bone so

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.340 
straight off they're off their bone so
the<00:04:04.170> Agoge<00:04:04.650> tendon<00:04:05.010> organ<00:04:05.400> didn't<00:04:05.730> fire<00:04:06.350> that

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
the Agoge tendon organ didn't fire that

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.960 
the Agoge tendon organ didn't fire that
said<00:04:07.769> they<00:04:07.950> were<00:04:08.040> used<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.580> amount<00:04:08.850> of

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
said they were used to this amount of

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.789 
said they were used to this amount of
force<00:04:09.209> they<00:04:09.420> could<00:04:09.570> cope<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.230> but

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
force they could cope with it but

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.759 
force they could cope with it but
instead<00:04:11.540> what<00:04:12.540> happened<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.200> tendon

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
instead what happened is this tendon

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.800 
instead what happened is this tendon
here<00:04:14.130> just<00:04:14.760> got<00:04:14.910> pulled<00:04:15.150> straight<00:04:15.510> off<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
here just got pulled straight off the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.940 
here just got pulled straight off the
bone<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:17.330> it's<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.959> very<00:04:18.989> nasty<00:04:19.440> injury

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
bone and it's a it's a very nasty injury
