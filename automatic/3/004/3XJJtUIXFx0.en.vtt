 before that I was not a sports kid 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.050
 Grade 7, I rolled downhill 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.860
 started skipping school started smoking and 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.400
 drinking and to ninth grade me barely

 kicked out of school I got a certificate 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 aiming screwdrivers naturally 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.210
 physical education I had a troika I could not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.760
 run not three kilometers 1 kilometer 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 I could not run and smoked easily

 a pack of cigarettes per day per night 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.820
 a disco could drink 6 and a half chic beer 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.860
 also very easy and then one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.550
 beautiful moment when i entered 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.550
 the ceiling 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.840
 something clicked new team i saw 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.759
 saw a man who is probably me 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 slightly motivated he was a little higher 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 even though I am a normal height meter 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.130
 eighty six and he was bigger he 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.310
 worked in the gym and he me 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.430
 was a clear leader in our group to me 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.130
 I wanted to be something like him 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.440
 I started studying myself from a friend 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.459
 neighbor barbell it was so saudi 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.870
 barbell probably 30 and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.420
 exercise first came to me 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.310
 head just what i came up with can 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.130
 do with the rod then I did it were 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.010
 for sure remember it was a bench press standing 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.820
 to chin squats and bench press me 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.410
 remember especially because I left 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.209
 Alas, I did not have stools 4 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.360
 I had to put identical stools 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.850
 different and it turned out they were leaving a little 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.450
 up that is, had to lie and 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.470
 catching balance while moving i 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.959
 took the bar for some reason narrow grip and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.680
 did uzhal no technology was out of the question 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.470
 at that moment and from the breath I just took 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.750
 did it and did not breathe after some 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.270
 time I realized that it was so stupid and 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.470
 can 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.720
 very easy to plant a heart and some 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.850
 health problems get and even in 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.520
 swooning fall and 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.500
 from these training me a little bit 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.500
 grown hands in principle is understandable 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.080
 because it was a biceps lift and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.970
 bench press narrow grip chest and 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.620
 remained flat nothing else 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.720
 grew apart from a little arm muscles and end up 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.850
 and friends told me that I did not let us down 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.320
 but just a little fat 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.070
 and then I went to my first hall at first 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.960
 it was a bit dumb and unusual 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.570
 great uncles raising huge verso 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.060
 at that time it seemed to them and tortured there 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.760
 his box office type of bathroom and wanted 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.850
 somehow zabazit on the hall to engage 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.480
 probably more at home I remember 1 week was 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.630
 very heavy accounted for right 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.880
 force yourself to go hall because it was 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.660
 to this is the fear of him that any of the new 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.610
 the atmosphere 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.790
 new environment but with time when 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.320
 you start to communicate with these guys 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.799
 made friends we and they really 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.460
 turned out to be kind and cheerful and there already 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.040
 I became like a house I still remember that 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.050
 one man in the hall he then approached us 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.140
 was looking for a show to go there alone isolation all the time 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.990
 done forget at all for two years from 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.100
 simulators but at the time something i'm not 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.160
 especially listened to him probably in vain 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.450
 17 years I decided to leave home and moved 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.470
 in Saint-Petersburg 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.480
 transferred here got the room rented 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.330
 of our work bought a subscription to the hall and 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.790
 began to engage in more detail 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.580
 He was interested in dietology training and 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.590
 principle has grown to 90 kilograms with his 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.390
 height meter 80 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.669
 I always wanted to study 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.290
 contact sports such as 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.900
 american football and rugby 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.230
 and by chance I met a player in 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.620
 the world 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.480
 women's football I decided to try myself 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.640
 and began training in griffins 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.980
 american football is very hard game 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.530
 very complicated corrected they enter 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.170
 Guinness Book of Records this game is still 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.900
 called chess on the field if you 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.010
 interesting and you want to try 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.460
 practice playing American 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.550
 football 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.810
 you can write me my page 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.370
 written below in the video description 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.720
 Currently I work as a coach 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.280
 I try myself as a fitness model and 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.970
 I am preparing for such new nominations as 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.660
 mans physicist 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.750
 This such Olya beachmen in shorts 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.450
 walking around the stage or in a male bikini 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.310
 as some call it decided 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.530
 try yourself in this nomination because 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.270
 that it is much easier 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.790
 example if I compare even with 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.210
 Classic bodybuilding I need 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.060
 such stiffness on to huge legs 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.910
 because everything is hiding poached but on 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.160
 actually the guy there looks yes worth it 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.800
 Currently, I naturally have drying and 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.860
 and the second network is around 50 grams 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.440
 carbohydrate is actually drying me on 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.780
 over the past two years, I probably 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.180
 two weeks to dry two days overeat 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.410
 humiliated Sasha you do not bring me all the time 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.300
 yourself to some point 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.180
 how should a fitness model look like 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.090
 minimal interlayer fat and all the time 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.660
 I donâ€™t like to keep her especially big 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.590
 muscle mass I want to look like 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.530
 embossed and toned all the time 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.050
 to pursue a fitness model career and 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.690
 can somehow move to a new level and 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.580
 Naturally I will achieve this because I 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.210
 now is a good motivation to give up 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.890
 not bad at the World Championships in Kiev and on 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.330
 Arnold Classic in October 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:02.550
 will become and scars 16 lighter chose exactly 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.890
 this way because now I get 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.840
 tremendous pleasure kicks from 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.170
 workouts from nutrition and feel 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.940
 well and what you want in one 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.610
 fitness club I have been going for

 three years old and many people involved in there 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.100
 I know for a long time and throughout this 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.860
 a little time they 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.140
 practically did not change in my opinion 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.940
 this is for the lack of information if 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.710
 people watched it one by one and 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.060
 sees 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.910
 for several months before they already 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.590
 nice to disassemble reality and 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.260
 already saw some result therefore 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.750
 subscribe to the yougifted channel 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:44.150

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.150
 Swami was Mironov Sergei all bye
