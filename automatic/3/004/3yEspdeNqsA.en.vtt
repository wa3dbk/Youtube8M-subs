00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.550 
sustain his energy levels yeah so
obviously<00:02:15.459> cup<00:02:16.360> has<00:02:16.540> an<00:02:16.660> open<00:02:16.900> top<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
obviously cup has an open top to it so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.589 
obviously cup has an open top to it so
you<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.950> grab<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> top<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.819> say<00:02:19.120> crush

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
you want to grab the top and I say crush

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.430 
you want to grab the top and I say crush
it<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:19.930> pinch<00:02:20.170> it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
it or pinch it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.290 
it or pinch it
so<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.890> you're<00:02:21.040> essentially<00:02:21.730> closing<00:02:22.210> it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
so that you're essentially closing it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.240 
so that you're essentially closing it
and<00:02:22.480> some<00:02:22.990> water<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:23.830> out<00:02:24.070> but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and some water is going to get out but

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
and some water is going to get out but
it<00:02:24.370> should<00:02:24.550> be<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:24.700> minimal<00:02:25.570> but<00:02:25.930> you're

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
it should be very minimal but you're

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.270 
it should be very minimal but you're
holding<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.380> lot<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.190> then

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
holding a lot of it in there and then

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.430 
holding a lot of it in there and then
you<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:27.910> do<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.390> create<00:02:28.690> almost

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you what you do is you create almost

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.230 
you what you do is you create almost
like<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.710> small<00:02:30.040> funnel<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.820> yourself<00:02:31.120> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
like a small funnel for yourself to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.490 
like a small funnel for yourself to
drink<00:02:31.510> out<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.960> it's<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.290> lot<00:02:32.440> easier

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
drink out of and it's just a lot easier

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.070
