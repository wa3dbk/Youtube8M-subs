00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.870
 or not 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.580
 hello everyone is the same and today we continue with 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.530
 the series of starting a game like 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.150
 ninja and let's review two maps as 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.000
 the past these are going to be brain and 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.160
 square and we're going to it percent for those 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.480
 who watched the video last I'm going to 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.820
 make a small series to do all 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.279
 the maps of black ops 2 and I'm going to put 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.989
 a note forgiveness I'm going to put one in 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.669
 a playlist in the 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.200
 description as you can see from 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.489
 our puts we run this part where 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.520
 it's like this little square or this 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.690
 tiny garden of cactus is and here I 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.760
 I stop because the enemies always 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.949
 they leave that back house certainly 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.679
 I accept fatal shot and killed him a 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.410
 partner and this house upstairs enters 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.420
 sniper are people with precision rifles 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.100
 because they know that one comes here and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.499
 recommendation what are you trying to hack into 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.719
 the enemies does not help 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.510
 this garage or this parking lot is just 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.100
 where they make the gray put the enemies 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 Well, it's available because they put them 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 team deathmatch is completely mobile 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.649
 but say that is where exposed them 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.449
 the first time and like the last time that 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.200
 he had told them about dominating the game in 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.390
 the deathmatch team here you have to manage 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.270
 the maps should always be like your 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.829
 move let's say in quadrants obviously 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.659
 my classmates are trying to come 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.840
 but as you can see in general it happens that 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.250
 In team deathmatch, 12 rogers come out 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.930
 team are runners who try to 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.530
 get to the opposite spot but the others 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.180
 they run with more procedures than the one 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.159
 of the map and there they are left behind 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.110
 waiting for the other team to arrive 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.549
 they are in the middle then the centers 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.280
 of maps is where almost always happens 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.049
 all the action and where there is more 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 enemies together and also 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.810
 companions of you all together 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.180
 They are a place where I always recommend 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.430
 that they do not get involved if they get into 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.570
 centers then can not flank the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.000
 enemies that what we want to do with 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.740
 these strategies and we fail is better 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.049
 confront the enemies one by one or 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.159
 maybe two by two and that's the break 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.229
 I'm not going to talk much about Reid because 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.000
 truth is that I analyzed it thoroughly 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.320
 in another video here we are going to talk in 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.869
 places that a lot of people me 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.670
 asked in place when you are born on this side 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.689
 puts them and really when you're on 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.010
 another side, I always put them 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.630
 recommend the following 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.130
 take the right and go through the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.390
 side where is the disco if it were the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.770
 other side they see you on the side and the left 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.810
 is not with barbies and also take the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 side the disco eye that the rosters of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.470
 this side arrives faster here then 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420
 as you can see even if they gave me 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 assistance this for my double fun 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.400
 and triple carats that my companions 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.110
 here badly functioning because all 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.120
 they fought with me but this is ras 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 immediately I feel you find them from 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.810
 front I feel that I have to have 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.430
 be careful here like all my companions 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.540
 grab on the right the decision that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.160
 I take to go to the left is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.450
 because this is the other path that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.150
 you can take where they enter this 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 as a store I see you in this part a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.880
 lots of enemies come out obviously already 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.220
 I would not have found them and if they see 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.810
 the glasses were already broken from the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.090
 store and the reason is because obviously 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.710
 and they had been there forever 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.210
 I recommend them in team deathmatch follow 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.230
 where are the skulls where they are 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.870
 the skulls means that there were 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.610
 enemy action that enemies killed 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.580
 fellow of you and well here I have 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.470
 the bad luck that in a fight with one 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.670
 of those sold to kill the second but 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.740
 no problem, I will leave a little 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.620
 more because we can still get all 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.590
 good cues tricks and still do a 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.670
 good game this time is emulate after 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.380
 of this death 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.030
 we recover to the other 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.140
 side and see the most important thing just like 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.480
 I always tell them you understand nights 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.950
 recognize where they are put does not stop 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.209
 go front you have to be very careful 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.830
 because I do not like indifferent 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.540
 when I'm flanking what I said 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.010
 the last council but to be able 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 franking and getting to friends by 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.090
 behind and be able to kill one in one or two 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.459
 in two 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 this was here changing waiting to see 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.190
 the part of the stairs is very 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.420
 important that those areas of the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.160
 balconies that are on this side and the 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.239
 another side always come to the stairs 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.410
 where is the source that is here to the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.870
 right and you have to be very careful 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.800
 with that area because it gets many 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.750
 snyder if when they are there is a person 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.790
 good every time you get to that 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.700
 part so you end up here shining and 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.560
 well here coming again to expose 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.989
 enemy trying to whiten the and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.150
 just the creative thing is the control of 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.590
 exposes the game and here I am about to 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.510
 kill the enemy remotely with the weapon 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.269
 last but because it has slow cadence 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.250
 failed to shoot the enemy first and 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.440
 tell me kill good guys this is like 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.730
 we make a ninja after start in these two 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.870
 maps I hope the x was searched 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.120
 favor and all tastes but of what 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 os wins and until next time
