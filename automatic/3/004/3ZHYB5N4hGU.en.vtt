00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
internal frames have this have a lot of

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.050 
internal frames have this have a lot of
straps<00:06:00.140> on<00:06:00.410> them<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:01.250> make<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.550> easy<00:06:01.700> for<00:06:01.940> you

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.500 

this<00:06:15.410> is<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.590> two-person<00:06:16.070> tent<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:17.180> most<00:06:17.389> the

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
this is a two-person tent so most the

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.950 
this is a two-person tent so most the
time<00:06:17.720> I<00:06:17.750> actually<00:06:18.100> split<00:06:19.100> up<00:06:19.250> this<00:06:19.790> stuff<00:06:20.090> as

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
time I actually split up this stuff as

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.390 
time I actually split up this stuff as
you<00:06:21.169> can<00:06:21.320> see<00:06:21.500> there<00:06:21.650> are<00:06:21.770> two<00:06:21.950> main<00:06:22.130> pieces

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
you can see there are two main pieces

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.400 
you can see there are two main pieces
the<00:06:22.850> dark<00:06:23.090> one<00:06:23.270> is<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:23.600> actual<00:06:23.990> tent<00:06:24.290> the

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
the dark one is the actual tent the

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.920 
the dark one is the actual tent the
light<00:06:24.620> one<00:06:24.800> is<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:25.070> rain<00:06:25.280> fly<00:06:25.580> what<00:06:26.510> I<00:06:26.540> like<00:06:26.810> to

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
light one is the rain fly what I like to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.450 
light one is the rain fly what I like to
do<00:06:27.050> is<00:06:27.230> give<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.530> rain<00:06:27.710> fly<00:06:27.980> in<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.220> poles

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
do is give the rain fly in the poles

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.040 
do is give the rain fly in the poles
which<00:06:28.820> are<00:06:28.940> buried<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.419> the<00:06:29.510> tent<00:06:29.720> right<00:06:29.780> now

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
which are buried in the tent right now

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.050 
which are buried in the tent right now
to<00:06:30.110> someone<00:06:30.410> else<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:30.950> then<00:06:31.520> I'll<00:06:31.669> carry<00:06:31.910> the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
to someone else and then I'll carry the

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:44.149 
to someone else and then I'll carry the
tan<00:06:32.240> or<00:06:32.270> vice<00:06:32.510> versa

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.729 

that's<00:06:44.729> pretty<00:06:44.969> good<00:06:45.209> I<00:06:45.599> think<00:06:46.050> ideally<00:06:46.559> I

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:46.739 
that's pretty good I think ideally I

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.169 
that's pretty good I think ideally I
would<00:06:46.860> actually<00:06:47.309> end<00:06:47.429> up<00:06:47.520> shoving<00:06:47.879> this<00:06:48.029> in

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:48.179 
would actually end up shoving this in

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:50.179 
would actually end up shoving this in
the<00:06:48.270> top<00:06:48.479> but<00:06:49.139> we're<00:06:49.289> just<00:06:49.409> gonna<00:06:49.499> move<00:06:49.709> on<00:06:49.919> for

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
the top but we're just gonna move on for

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:59.519 
the top but we're just gonna move on for
now

00:06:59.519 --> 00:06:59.529 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:09.969 

easily<00:07:00.489> fixable

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.800 

all<00:07:10.979> right<00:07:11.280> another<00:07:12.210> thing<00:07:12.509> that<00:07:12.629> I<00:07:12.689> like

to<00:07:24.090> very<00:07:24.300> quickly<00:07:24.569> sometimes<00:07:30.169> okay<00:07:31.169> we're<00:07:31.439> all

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 
to very quickly sometimes okay we're all

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.490 
to very quickly sometimes okay we're all
strapped<00:07:31.919> in<00:07:32.750> it's<00:07:33.750> a<00:07:33.810> good<00:07:33.960> thing<00:07:34.199> with<00:07:34.349> an

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 
strapped in it's a good thing with an

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.230 
strapped in it's a good thing with an
internal<00:07:34.919> frame<00:07:35.069> to<00:07:35.310> tighten<00:07:35.639> things<00:07:35.789> up<00:07:36.000> real

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
internal frame to tighten things up real

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.520 
internal frame to tighten things up real
tight<00:07:36.479> because<00:07:36.509> again<00:07:36.960> that<00:07:37.110> improves

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
tight because again that improves

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.469 
tight because again that improves
stability<00:07:37.770> keeps<00:07:38.610> everything<00:07:38.849> real<00:07:39.090> cinched

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 
stability keeps everything real cinched

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.719 
stability keeps everything real cinched
up<00:07:39.569> so<00:07:39.780> when<00:07:39.930> you<00:07:40.020> throw<00:07:40.229> it<00:07:40.349> on<00:07:43.490> things<00:07:44.490> aren't

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:44.729 
up so when you throw it on things aren't

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:49.939 
up so when you throw it on things aren't
moving<00:07:44.879> around<00:07:45.090> too<00:07:45.539> much<00:07:45.719> so<00:07:48.469> I<00:07:49.469> would<00:07:49.620> strap

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949 
moving around too much so I would strap

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.439 
moving around too much so I would strap
myself<00:07:50.129> on<00:07:50.520> we'll<00:07:50.699> talk<00:07:50.849> about<00:07:51.120> how<00:07:51.240> to<00:07:51.300> do

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449 
myself on we'll talk about how to do

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.629 
myself on we'll talk about how to do
that<00:07:51.569> another<00:07:51.900> time<00:07:52.169> and<00:07:52.710> throw<00:07:53.189> these<00:07:53.340> poles

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 
that another time and throw these poles

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.730 
that another time and throw these poles
together<00:07:53.849> and<00:07:54.240> off<00:07:54.330> we<00:07:54.539> would<00:07:54.659> go<00:07:54.779> so<00:07:55.379> remember

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 
together and off we would go so remember

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.800 
together and off we would go so remember
the<00:07:55.889> two<00:07:56.039> things<00:07:56.279> you<00:07:56.460> need<00:07:56.610> to<00:07:56.789> know<00:07:56.969> are<00:07:57.659> to

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.810 
the two things you need to know are to
