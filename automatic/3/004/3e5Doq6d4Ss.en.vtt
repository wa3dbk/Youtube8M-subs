00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 and many greet these gentlemen tech 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.639
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.289
 little test so it's been a while 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.730
 that I did not do and today I 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.510
 will test a brand product raf 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.220
 power so this is the 5.1 job queue 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 so as you can see at the level of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.680
 packaging 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's very simple but it's very classy 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 at the same time you have all the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 information on the back available and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.130
 the product is well packaged so in very 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.510
 good point at that level we have a small 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.880
 look at what's inside 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 so we're going to open all this so in a 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.800
 first time we have access to the record 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.620
 of use which is I specify it in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 English so the product is not hard to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.149
 use but we might have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 favorite be it in french what 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.809
 be it she is very good 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.600
 explained in English 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.040
 then we have of course the battery 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.860
 notebook that does not do that battery 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.380
 so this is the product we will see by the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 suite and a cord for use 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 so especially to send his 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.580
 smartphone to the battery and there is 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.440
 nothing else 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.190
 so we're going a little bit removed 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 which is basic protections on 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.680
 so we can see that the product in all 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 case was very well protected so at 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.409
 design level the product is my faith 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 rather pretty we notice good reflection you 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.200
 I rather brilliant colors 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.790
 we also have the small body must so we 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.729
 goes a little bit looked at his level 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.110
 size what does that give the cord is 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.070
 not very big but anyway we 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.630
 does not intend 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.570
 I think we use this kind of 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.170
 product to deviate too much from the battery 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.110
 and the length we're going to say is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.070
 reasonable compared to others 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.420
 batteries available on the market 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 so there we can see a little bit all 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.350
 the features that there are so you 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.070
 see you can put a sd card 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.649
 for example you have the usb port 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.679
 otherwise at the level of the rest is not 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.480
 big big features to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.159
 specify early 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 the usb plug to our smartphone and in 2 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.510
 3 go the connection is done and your 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.330
 smartphone will start charging and so 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.739
 loading is fast enough it's not 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.349
 if you want to be a use 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.430
 and will continue to increase 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.470
 so that's a good point because 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 often it helps to just maintain the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.420
 current battery and there it will be 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.280
 complementary 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.930
 finally you can navigate between the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.980
 navigations using the button on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 which I am supporting in this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.560
 So now on the left and so ago in 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.440
 of data sharing in wifi that can 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.579
 do the hard drive you can do 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.780
 turn your smartphone into a hotspot 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.359
 with data etc 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.730
 so all the information you want 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.910
 explained in the instructions for use and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.370
 on the site of raf power so for 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.930
 summarize it's a good battery with 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.599
 full of features and more so at the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.069
 price of 39 euros 99 currently instead 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.829
 from 49 euros 99 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.959
 the product is available on amazon and 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.750
 me he convinced me I find it rather 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.390
 pretty as a whole is very 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.430
 transportable end use practice 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 if you need more info 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.459
 I invite you to go to the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 description go bye everyone
