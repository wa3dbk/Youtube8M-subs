00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
know I really find these incredible

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.750 
know I really find these incredible
jewels<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.560> moment<00:01:33.980> you<00:01:34.280> know<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:34.580> the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
jewels in the moment you know that's the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.610 
jewels in the moment you know that's the
beautiful<00:01:35.060> part<00:01:35.240> about<00:01:35.750> making<00:01:36.290> that

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
beautiful part about making that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.240 
beautiful part about making that
connection<00:01:37.040> for<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> first<00:01:37.850> time<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:39.250> really

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
connection for the first time and really

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.760 
connection for the first time and really
I<00:01:40.460> guess<00:01:41.000> my<00:01:41.210> coaching<00:01:41.570> style<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.380> there<00:01:42.620> is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
I guess my coaching style that there is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.360 
I guess my coaching style that there is
no<00:01:43.070> specific<00:01:43.850> way<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.420> do<00:01:44.660> it<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.830> happens

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
no specific way to do it that it happens

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.650 
no specific way to do it that it happens
in<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.580> moment<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.030> that's<00:01:47.210> when<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.479> magic

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
in the moment and that's when the magic

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.280 
in the moment and that's when the magic
takes<00:01:48.020> place

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.070 

I<00:01:52.340> mean<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> Grammy<00:01:54.270> has<00:01:54.780> been

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
I mean so when a Grammy has been

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.710 
I mean so when a Grammy has been
incredible<00:01:55.800> going<00:01:56.760> after<00:01:57.060> an<00:01:57.150> Oscar<00:01:57.510> is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
incredible going after an Oscar is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.300 
incredible going after an Oscar is
ambitious<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.560> an<00:01:59.250> Emmy<00:01:59.520> now<00:02:00.180> having<00:02:00.720> that

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
ambitious but an Emmy now having that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.490 

I<00:02:16.459> think<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.150> happened<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.660> season<00:02:18.050> four<00:02:18.290> was

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
think that we exceeded the expectations

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.710 
think that we exceeded the expectations
that<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.489> world<00:02:25.700> set<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.209> us<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.450> mean<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
that the world set for us I mean the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.150 
that the world set for us I mean the
voice<00:02:26.870> by<00:02:27.470> itself

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
voice by itself

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.130 
voice by itself
already<00:02:28.819> comes<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> certain<00:02:29.599> level<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
already comes with a certain level of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.400 
already comes with a certain level of
you<00:02:30.860> know<00:02:30.980> credibility<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.900> able<00:02:33.230> to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
you know credibility but to be able to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.589 
you know credibility but to be able to

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
you know come with new ideas I think

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.320 
you know come with new ideas I think
that<00:02:35.780> some<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> things<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.400> was<00:02:38.180> able

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
introduce kind of gave a new perspective

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.640 
introduce kind of gave a new perspective
of<00:02:42.590> how<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.830> approach<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.310> not<00:02:43.700> only<00:02:43.970> for<00:02:44.650> for
