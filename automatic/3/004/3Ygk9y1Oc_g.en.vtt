hey<00:00:01.829> folks<00:00:02.040> girls<00:00:02.280> my<00:00:02.399> four<00:00:02.580> here<00:00:02.730> go<00:00:03.389> through

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey folks girls my four here go through

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey folks girls my four here go through
a<00:00:03.629> real<00:00:03.810> quick

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
a real quick

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.550 
a real quick
install<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.069> manual<00:00:05.460> fan<00:00:05.700> switch<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.960> use

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
install on the manual fan switch I use

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.470 
install on the manual fan switch I use
the<00:00:07.799> same<00:00:08.099> switches<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.059> use<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the same switches that I use for the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.669 
the same switches that I use for the
manual<00:00:09.750> headlight<00:00:10.019> switch<00:00:10.110> these<00:00:10.440> little

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
manual headlight switch these little

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.999 
manual headlight switch these little
round<00:00:10.830> LED<00:00:11.670> style<00:00:12.090> switches<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> they're

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
round LED style switches so they're

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.259 
round LED style switches so they're
going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.219> almost<00:00:14.490> identical<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
going to be almost identical to that

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.010 
going to be almost identical to that
switch<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:17.430> only<00:00:17.609> difference<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
switch the only difference is because of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
switch the only difference is because of
the<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.350> circuit<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> bike<00:00:20.510> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the way this circuit is on the bike the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.370 
the way this circuit is on the bike the
LED<00:00:21.990> will<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:23.119> when<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.359> fans<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.140> on

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
LED will be on when the fans are not on

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.460 
LED will be on when the fans are not on
and<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> switch<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:28.140> run<00:00:28.320> your

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and when you switch this on to run your

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.030 
and when you switch this on to run your
fan<00:00:28.680> manually<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.550> light<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.150> so

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
fan manually the light will go out so

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
fan manually the light will go out so
that<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:32.850> reversed<00:00:33.149> from<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that is a little bit reversed from the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
that is a little bit reversed from the
headlight<00:00:33.989> switch<00:00:34.140> or<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
headlight switch or you can run the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090 
headlight switch or you can run the
headlight<00:00:35.399> switch<00:00:35.489> always<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.120> LED<00:00:36.739> but<00:00:37.739> due

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
headlight switch always on LED but due

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.380 
headlight switch always on LED but due
to<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> basic<00:00:38.640> design<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to the basic design of it and the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
to the basic design of it and the
circuit<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> bike<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.649> how

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
circuit on the bike that's that's how

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.910 
circuit on the bike that's that's how
it's<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.090> switch

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
it's going to be on this switch

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's going to be on this switch
basically<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> same<00:00:44.370> type<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> deal

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
basically it's the same type of deal

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
basically it's the same type of deal
you've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> two<00:00:45.510> positive<00:00:45.960> leads<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> you've

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you've got two positive leads and you've

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
you've got two positive leads and you've
got<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.770> ground<00:00:47.070> wire<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> ground

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
got this ground wire here the ground

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
got this ground wire here the ground
wire<00:00:48.809> runs<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> led<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:50.219> sake<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> speed<00:00:50.730> on

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
wire runs the led for sake of speed on

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.160 
wire runs the led for sake of speed on
the<00:00:50.969> video<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.360> already<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> ground<00:00:52.020> wire

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the video I've already got a ground wire

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.569 
the video I've already got a ground wire
hooked<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> plug<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
hooked up so I'm going to plug that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
hooked up so I'm going to plug that
while<00:00:53.940> talked<00:00:54.149> about<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:56.930> I've<00:00:57.930> already

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
simple to do if you just be patient

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450 
simple to do if you just be patient
and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.420> you're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> use<00:01:37.280> two<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and then you're going to use two of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
and then you're going to use two of
these<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.229> supply<00:01:40.740> they're<00:01:40.950> called<00:01:41.659> quick

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
these that I supply they're called quick

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
these that I supply they're called quick
splices<00:01:43.549> what<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> you've<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> long

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
splices what it is you've got a long

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.319 
splices what it is you've got a long
channel<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.409> your<00:01:46.649> existing<00:01:47.100> wire<00:01:47.329> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
channel here for your existing wire and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810 
channel here for your existing wire and
then<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> short<00:01:49.070> channel<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.640> one

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then a short channel that you put one

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.639 
then a short channel that you put one
wire<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.540> kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> terminates<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
wire in and it kind of terminates on the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.950 
wire in and it kind of terminates on the
backside<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.220> can't<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:53.610> any<00:01:53.759> further<00:01:53.960> so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
backside so you can't go any further so

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.499 
backside so you can't go any further so
all<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.329> matter

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
all you want to do is it doesn't matter

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
all you want to do is it doesn't matter
which<00:01:57.780> wire<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> hook<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> which<00:01:59.509> but<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
which wire you hook to which but you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
which wire you hook to which but you
want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.469> existing<00:02:01.770> wire<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> run

connector<00:02:17.970> it'll<00:02:18.360> slide<00:02:18.599> all<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> way

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
connector it'll slide all the way

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
connector it'll slide all the way
through<00:02:19.140> both<00:02:19.260> wires<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.769> click<00:02:20.099> you'll<00:02:21.030> hear

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
through both wires and click you'll hear

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
through both wires and click you'll hear
an<00:02:21.269> audible<00:02:21.420> click<00:02:21.659> it's<00:02:22.110> pretty<00:02:22.409> takes<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
an audible click it's pretty takes a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.140 
an audible click it's pretty takes a
pretty<00:02:23.129> good<00:02:23.250> amount<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.580> pressure<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> get<00:02:24.090> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
pretty good amount of pressure to get it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.449 
pretty good amount of pressure to get it
and<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.750> not<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.260> correctly<00:02:25.860> done<00:02:26.069> until

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
and it's not really correctly done until

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.539 
and it's not really correctly done until
that<00:02:26.670> metal<00:02:27.530> metal<00:02:28.530> connector<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.099> basically

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
that metal metal connector is basically

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.039 
that metal metal connector is basically
flush<00:02:29.819> with<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.150> red<00:02:30.390> piece<00:02:30.629> you'll<00:02:30.810> you'll

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
flush with this red piece you'll you'll

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.199 
flush with this red piece you'll you'll
definitely<00:02:31.440> know<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.799> happens<00:02:32.209> but

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
definitely know when it happens but

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.580 
definitely know when it happens but
until<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.629> flat<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.110> won't<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.349> able<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
until it's flat you won't be able to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.009 
until it's flat you won't be able to
fold<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.920> over<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.400> lock<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.700> once<00:02:36.629> once

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
fold this over and lock it once once

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:37.970 
fold this over and lock it once once
you've<00:02:37.170> clipped<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.709> way<00:02:37.769> through

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you've clipped it all the way through

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.650 
you've clipped it all the way through
you<00:02:38.099> can<00:02:38.129> fold<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.940> way<00:02:39.000> across<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you can fold this all the way across and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.539 
you can fold this all the way across and
it'll<00:02:39.810> snap<00:02:39.930> into<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.379> lock<00:02:40.620> you'll<00:02:41.280> hear<00:02:41.459> that

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
it'll snap into a lock you'll hear that

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.890 
it'll snap into a lock you'll hear that
audible<00:02:42.030> click<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.390> you'll<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.569> able<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.750> tell

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
audible click and you'll be able to tell

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.770 
audible click and you'll be able to tell
that<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.170> closed<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that it's closed just like that so it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.720 
that it's closed just like that so it
will<00:02:45.840> end<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.049> looking<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.379> this<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.549> two

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
will end up looking like this the two

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.809 
will end up looking like this the two
long<00:02:48.000> channels<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:50.040> your<00:02:50.190> existing<00:02:50.609> wiring

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
long channels to your existing wiring

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.080 
long channels to your existing wiring
and<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.329> two<00:02:51.540> wires<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.590> provide<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and the two wires that I provide but it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.449 
and the two wires that I provide but it
in<00:02:54.239> there<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.590> everything<00:02:55.799> clamped<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
in there and then everything clamped and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.880 
in there and then everything clamped and
close<00:02:56.640> together<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.239> pretty<00:02:57.480> much<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.959> want

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
close together that's pretty much I want

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 
close together that's pretty much I want
to<00:02:58.920> say<00:02:59.069> permanently<00:02:59.579> installed<00:02:59.970> obviously

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to say permanently installed obviously

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
to say permanently installed obviously
you<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.720> pull<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> off<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:02.519> it'd<00:03:02.940> be

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you can pull it off of there but it'd be

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.059 
you can pull it off of there but it'd be
a<00:03:03.239> little<00:03:03.329> difficult<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.900> pull<00:03:04.079> off<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
a little difficult to pull off and you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.380 
a little difficult to pull off and you
have<00:03:05.250> some<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.700> Nick's<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.209> wires

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
have some you know Nick's and your wires

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.420 
have some you know Nick's and your wires
if<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.530> ever<00:03:07.650> didn't<00:03:07.920> want<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.129> use<00:03:08.220> this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
if you ever didn't want to use this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.970 
if you ever didn't want to use this
setup<00:03:09.359> it'd<00:03:09.840> almost<00:03:09.989> be<00:03:10.170> easier<00:03:10.290> just<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.739> clip

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
setup it'd almost be easier just to clip

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.920 
setup it'd almost be easier just to clip
the<00:03:11.129> wires<00:03:11.310> off<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.640> here<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.180> tape<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
the wires off the here and and tape it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.710 
the wires off the here and and tape it
up<00:03:13.049> but<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.940> kind<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.299> not<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
up but so it's a kind of a not as a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.390 
up but so it's a kind of a not as a
plug-and-play<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.739> other<00:03:16.889> stuff<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
plug-and-play as the other stuff it's a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.650 
plug-and-play as the other stuff it's a
little<00:03:17.459> bit<00:03:17.700> more<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.970> permanent<00:03:18.180> install

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
little bit more of a permanent install

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.979 
little bit more of a permanent install
but<00:03:19.620> once<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.859> get<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.099> done<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.450> come<00:03:21.959> up

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
but once you get it done and you come up

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.420 
but once you get it done and you come up
here<00:03:22.260> you're<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:22.919> match<00:03:23.040> your<00:03:23.069> switch
