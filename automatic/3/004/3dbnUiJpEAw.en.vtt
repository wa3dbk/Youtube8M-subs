now let's turn this guy into destroy
mode<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.689> reveal<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.650> green<00:00:22.949> instead<00:00:23.640> of

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699

red

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.960 

it's<00:00:35.230> hard<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.650> believe<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:36.130> know<00:00:36.190> but<00:00:36.340> somehow

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
it's hard to believe I know but somehow

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's hard to believe I know but somehow
that<00:00:37.030> transformation<00:00:37.780> looks<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.050> little<00:00:38.200> bit

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
that transformation looks a little bit

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.070 
that transformation looks a little bit
better<00:00:38.650> in<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.040> anime<00:00:39.970> anyway<00:00:40.750> everybody

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
better in the anime anyway everybody

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.750

what's<00:00:41.380> your<00:00:41.530> impression<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.580> big

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
what's your impression of this the big

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.160 
what's your impression of this the big
difference<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.180> course<00:00:43.240> being<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.750> it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
difference of course being that it's

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.260 
difference of course being that it's
green<00:00:44.590> instead<00:00:44.950> of<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.130> pink<00:00:45.340> /<00:00:45.550> red<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.150> even

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
green instead of the pink / red and even

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.790 
green instead of the pink / red and even
without<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.900> decals<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.320> here<00:00:47.470> I<00:00:47.500> think<00:00:47.710> it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
without the decals on here I think it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.800 
without the decals on here I think it
looks<00:00:47.950> fantastic<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.790> green<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.510> white<00:00:49.630> is<00:00:49.780> a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
looks fantastic the green of white is a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.120 
looks fantastic the green of white is a
great<00:00:49.870> combination<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.710> wouldn't<00:00:50.920> know<00:00:50.980> how

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
great combination you wouldn't know how

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.740 
great combination you wouldn't know how
blue<00:00:51.430> would<00:00:51.610> go<00:00:51.760> with<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.000> until<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.420> see<00:00:52.660> it

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
blue would go with that until you see it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.990 
blue would go with that until you see it
and<00:00:53.020> I<00:00:53.470> think<00:00:53.680> it's<00:00:53.830> working<00:00:54.040> just<00:00:54.460> fine<00:00:54.730> I

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
and I think it's working just fine I

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.970 
and I think it's working just fine I
think<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:55.840> a<00:00:55.870> yellow<00:00:56.290> that<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.590> used<00:00:56.830> for

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
think that that a yellow that I used for

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
think that that a yellow that I used for
the<00:00:57.100> V<00:00:57.250> Finn<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.700> just<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:58.000> little<00:00:58.239> bit

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the V Finn is just a little bit

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.200 
the V Finn is just a little bit
understated<00:01:00.010> but<00:01:00.370> then<00:01:00.550> again<00:01:00.670> maybe<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
understated but then again maybe the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.580 
understated but then again maybe the
lighter<00:01:01.450> tone<00:01:01.750> might<00:01:02.020> be<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.200> little<00:01:02.380> bit

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
lighter tone might be a little bit

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.040 
lighter tone might be a little bit
better<00:01:02.710> for<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.160> green<00:01:03.370> so<00:01:04.059> overall<00:01:04.390> I'm<00:01:04.720> very

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
better for the green so overall I'm very

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.450 
better for the green so overall I'm very
impressed<00:01:05.320> with<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.650> way<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:05.950> guy<00:01:06.130> looks

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
impressed with the way this guy looks

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.670 
impressed with the way this guy looks
outside<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.570> trouble<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:08.110> getting<00:01:08.380> them

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
outside of the trouble of getting them

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.790 
outside of the trouble of getting them
there<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.900> you're<00:01:11.020> talking<00:01:11.320> about<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.500> solid

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
there when you're talking about a solid

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.730 
there when you're talking about a solid
model<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.430> guy<00:01:12.610> no<00:01:12.940> longer<00:01:13.360> quite<00:01:13.780> fits<00:01:14.470> that

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
model this guy no longer quite fits that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.710 
model this guy no longer quite fits that
bill<00:01:14.800> although<00:01:15.670> whenever<00:01:16.000> he's<00:01:16.360> feeling<00:01:16.660> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
bill although whenever he's feeling a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.969 
bill although whenever he's feeling a
little<00:01:16.750> bit<00:01:17.050> loose<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.380> want<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.590> take<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.770> look

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
little bit loose you want to take a look

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.320 
little bit loose you want to take a look
to<00:01:18.070> make<00:01:18.130> sure<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.460> he's<00:01:18.610> locked<00:01:18.820> into<00:01:19.090> place

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
to make sure that he's locked into place

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.200 
to make sure that he's locked into place

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
solid as you could imagine anyway if

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.230 
solid as you could imagine anyway if
you're<00:01:26.950> trying<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.220> take<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.580> look<00:01:27.820> at<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
you're trying to take a look at the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.359 
you're trying to take a look at the
lower<00:01:28.450> body<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:29.290> can<00:01:29.500> move<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.890> skirts<00:01:30.190> up

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
lower body you can move the skirts up

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.950 
lower body you can move the skirts up
this<00:01:30.550> much<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.240> still<00:01:31.479> bring<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.720> leg

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
this much so you can still bring the leg

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.530 
this much so you can still bring the leg
forward<00:01:32.160> for<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> kick<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.700> side<00:01:33.910> skirts<00:01:34.330> are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
forward for a kick the side skirts are

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.940 
forward for a kick the side skirts are
not<00:01:34.570> going<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.170> get<00:01:35.259> in<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.440> way<00:01:35.560> any<00:01:35.770> more

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
not going to get in the way any more

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.650 
not going to get in the way any more
than<00:01:36.100> they<00:01:36.190> did<00:01:36.250> before<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.360> bring

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
than they did before so you can bring

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.749 
than they did before so you can bring
that<00:01:37.720> out<00:01:37.990> for<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.290> full<00:01:38.619> side<00:01:39.220> kick<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.670> you

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
that out for a full side kick if you

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.469 
that out for a full side kick if you
want<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> go<00:01:40.060> like<00:01:40.240> that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
want to go like that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.330 
want to go like that
then<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:41.350> are<00:01:41.410> going<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.830> bend<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.310> this

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
then these are going to bend like this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.460 
then these are going to bend like this
and<00:01:42.880> like<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:43.660> you're<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.229> get<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and like this so you're going to get the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.859 
and like this so you're going to get the
all-important<00:01:45.130> 90<00:01:45.369> degrees<00:01:45.670> those<00:01:46.420> ankles

Destroy mode here and that's because

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.450 
Destroy mode here and that's because
unless<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.500> cut<00:03:35.680> off<00:03:35.770> those<00:03:35.980> parts<00:03:36.250> from<00:03:36.340> the

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.500 

so<00:06:41.460> on<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:41.730> whole<00:06:41.880> even<00:06:42.180> though<00:06:42.240> there's<00:06:42.420> a

so on the whole even though there's a

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.000 
so on the whole even though there's a
lot<00:06:42.630> more<00:06:42.840> poses<00:06:43.260> that<00:06:43.380> you<00:06:43.440> can<00:06:43.650> do<00:06:43.770> and<00:06:43.980> you

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
lot more poses that you can do and you

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.380 
lot more poses that you can do and you
could<00:06:44.190> even<00:06:44.310> go<00:06:44.580> back<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:45.060> add<00:06:45.150> on<00:06:45.270> the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
could even go back and add on the

could even go back and add on the
Gatling<00:06:45.780> guns<00:06:46.020> which<00:06:46.230> is<00:06:46.380> something<00:06:46.680> that
