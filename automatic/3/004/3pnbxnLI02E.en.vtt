00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.710
 [Music] 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.870
 you have to pass kids like you are today 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.270
 -ha shines I bring a new tutorial 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.900
 on how to make a 100% bread farm 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.960
 automatic yes until crafter pan just what 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.300
 The only thing you have to do is make a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.910
 culture 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.460
 to see if I put good here to make a 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.199
 So, how do you put this 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.390
 villager has to be this color that 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.380
 I've tried with others and I do not know if it's 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.560
 book but it does not work 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.150
 you put a brown one and here you can put 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.010
 two to make it more effective as 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.530
 you want the door I do not know why or press 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.900
 but I think that we already have is eternal not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 I'm one hundred percent sure here you put 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.810
 hoppers because a property that has 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.790
 some new villagers snapshots 14 w 0 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.150
 4 by 1.8 and onwards I suppose that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.520
 when they catch a certain wheat this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.100
 village he does not go character and he's going to give it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.409
 to these villagers and how is there a fence in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.340
 half fall to the hoppers 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 and I set up a system here so that as 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.310
 when the bread comes here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.799
 the wagon is with him hopper pass by 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 here and they pick it up and then they put it in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.590
 This chest that you see has generated 11 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.730
 fans and that I leave it about 10 minutes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 because now I suddenly caught 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.240
 at almost one per minute is pretty 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.130
 efficient so the only one here is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.410
 that is a to intone so that when 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.900
 be day seeing the trolley is here 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.050
 at the beginning of the chords at night it 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.500
 comes for here and when this day is 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.740
 with ETA this active light sensor 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.470
 this rest rail then goes through 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.620
 here goes through here picks up the bread and what 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.160
 it gets into the box that when 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.770
 complete the day night cycle when it is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.420
 at night this goes off 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.780
 then light this torch there 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.150
 here because he lost the trolley like the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.580
 hopper goes down here takes the bread that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.100
 I'd gotten here and takes up 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.920
 here and have been the night time of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.290
 last night at night so you can put 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.290
 a farm in front of another farm 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.720
 and so you will make it very efficient even 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.650
 per floor if you want to do it you lower it 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.049
 with hopper and ready 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 and well let's grow this for 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.010
 see if he gives it to us 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.430
 if we do not soon get it then the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.680
 video everything to the camera fast and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.069
 We see how it gives the panda 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.069
 other villagers 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.380
 and good kids as you see has released 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.250
 there the bread for what happened I leave but 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.250
 hopper and now as you see four of bread 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.590
 It has not been long and now they have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:45.790
 last 24 minutes and as you can see four of 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.950
 bread is not bad at all this the more it is 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.959
 the day do not get here do not put 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.610
 many points so I do not say that you do 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.530
 several crops because if you can come 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.630
 together in the same crop is that of al 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.640
 this one here and this grain will pass it to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.340
 elder who has closer therefore 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.860
 the young man does not suck 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.990
 and then it will give us the final 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.210
 and here if you can put the villagers 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.600
 because it will detect it earlier because 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.160
 we have maybe the door I put it 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.209
 so that this one is controlled 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.569
 although I do not know if it will be very useful 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.150
 and good if you want to do your 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.460
 farms our farm styles 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.280
 stealing more things that few others 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.440
 things the two rails the implemented 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.810
 so you do not have to go for the car 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.880
 and it takes you home this would be a house 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 over here would be my little house 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.910
