00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
after high school I really felt like I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.200 
after high school I really felt like I
had<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.820> teach<00:01:08.090> myself<00:01:08.270> how<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:09.910> express<00:01:10.910> what

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
had to teach myself how to express what

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.780 
had to teach myself how to express what
was<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.510> me<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.440> was<00:01:12.560> interested<00:01:12.830> really<00:01:13.580> in

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
was in me and I was interested really in

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.970 
was in me and I was interested really in
fashion<00:01:14.720> at<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.080> time<00:01:15.350> because<00:01:15.800> what

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
fashion at that time because what

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.980 
fashion at that time because what
teenage<00:01:16.580> girl<00:01:16.820> isn't<00:01:16.970> interested<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.810> fashion

teenage girl isn't interested in fashion

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.390 
teenage girl isn't interested in fashion
so<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.350> thought<00:01:18.560> we'll<00:01:18.710> all<00:01:18.830> be<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.980> fashion

large<00:03:03.459> cow<00:03:04.620> figures<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.219> delicate

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
large cow figures with like delicate

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.690 
large cow figures with like delicate
lady<00:03:06.969> legs<00:03:07.359> and<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:09.069> seems<00:03:09.459> really

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
lady legs and it just seems really

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.000 
lady legs and it just seems really
natural<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.299> me<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.599> merge<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.319> two<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.919> I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
natural to me to merge the two and I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670 
natural to me to merge the two and I
think<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.549> like<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.359> kind<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.780> imbue<00:03:14.200> animals

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
think that like we kind of imbue animals

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.699 
think that like we kind of imbue animals
with<00:03:14.889> our<00:03:15.099> ideas<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:16.109> metaphysical<00:03:17.109> level<00:03:17.260> or

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
with our ideas of metaphysical level or

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.800 
with our ideas of metaphysical level or
spiritual<00:03:18.519> level<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:18.970> my<00:03:19.180> parents<00:03:19.599> when<00:03:19.780> I
