00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
the thread comes off the spool and into

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.640 
the thread comes off the spool and into
the<00:00:10.040> thread<00:00:10.310> guide<00:00:10.520> on<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:10.880> needle<00:00:11.180> arm<00:00:11.650> it's

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
the thread guide on the needle arm it's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.699 
the thread guide on the needle arm it's
lying<00:00:13.130> in<00:00:13.460> between<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:14.420> tension<00:00:14.900> disks<00:00:15.469> on

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
lying in between the tension disks on

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.779 
lying in between the tension disks on
the<00:00:15.980> needle<00:00:16.280> arm

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
the needle arm

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.150 
the needle arm
we've<00:00:17.660> threaded<00:00:18.260> it<00:00:18.380> through<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.830> thread

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
we've threaded it through the thread

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.600 
we've threaded it through the thread
guide<00:00:20.080> underneath<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.260> needle<00:00:21.560> arm<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:22.070> now

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
guide underneath the needle arm and now

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.970 
guide underneath the needle arm and now
we<00:00:22.670> need<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.150> thread<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.630> needle<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.830> our

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
we need to thread the needle so our

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.509 
we need to thread the needle so our
indispensable<00:00:25.750> needle<00:00:26.750> threader<00:00:27.199> comes<00:00:28.189> into

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
indispensable needle threader comes into

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.120 
indispensable needle threader comes into
play<00:00:28.810> we'll<00:00:29.810> need<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.199> slide<00:00:30.349> that<00:00:30.800> through

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
play we'll need to slide that through

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:40.840 
play we'll need to slide that through
the<00:00:31.429> hole<00:00:31.609> of<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.000> needle<00:00:36.790> there<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:37.910> go<00:00:39.850> now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
the hole of the needle there we go now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.450 
the hole of the needle there we go now
hopefully<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.480> can<00:00:41.780> see<00:00:42.110> that<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.280> little

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
hopefully you can see that the little

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.060 
hopefully you can see that the little
metal<00:00:43.879> loop<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:45.050> on<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.379> other<00:00:45.500> side<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
metal loop is on the other side of the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.160 
metal loop is on the other side of the
needle<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.379> let's<00:00:48.379> take<00:00:48.590> our<00:00:48.770> thread<00:00:49.160> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.779 

slide<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.350> through<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.710> loop<00:00:54.949> if<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.609> need

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
slide it through that loop if you need

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.810 
slide it through that loop if you need
to<00:00:55.910> moisten<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.449> end<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:56.960> thread<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.820> make

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
to moisten the end of the thread to make

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.349 
to moisten the end of the thread to make
it<00:00:59.000> go<00:00:59.539> through<00:00:59.570> quicker<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.890> good<00:01:01.070> idea

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
it go through quicker it's a good idea

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.770 
it go through quicker it's a good idea
okay<00:01:04.210> there<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:05.390> go<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.780> found<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:07.570> once<00:01:08.570> we've

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
okay there we go I found that once we've

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.260 
okay there we go I found that once we've
threaded<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> needle<00:01:09.760> before<00:01:10.760> we<00:01:10.940> start

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
threaded the needle before we start

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.899 
threaded the needle before we start
sewing<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:12.380> helpful<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.979> have<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.490> thread

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
sewing it's helpful to have that thread

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.230 
sewing it's helpful to have that thread
be<00:01:14.570> through<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.259> hole<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.580> fastening

has<00:01:45.770> been<00:01:46.009> threaded<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.390> thread<00:01:47.720> is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
has been threaded and the thread is

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.380 
has been threaded and the thread is
under<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.560> fastening<00:01:49.159> plate<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:50.060> will<00:01:50.210> make

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
under the fastening plate that will make

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.990 
under the fastening plate that will make
for<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.689> much<00:01:50.899> neater<00:01:51.350> sewing<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
for a much neater sewing and the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.149 
for a much neater sewing and the
beginning<00:01:53.509> stitch<00:01:53.780> will<00:01:54.049> automatically<00:01:54.950> be

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
beginning stitch will automatically be

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.920 
beginning stitch will automatically be
locked<00:01:56.860> every<00:01:57.860> time<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:58.340> change<00:01:58.610> thread<00:01:59.180> we

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
locked every time we change thread we

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.310 
locked every time we change thread we
will<00:02:00.229> have<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.770> rethread<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.610> needle<00:02:02.170> but<00:02:03.170> we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
will have to rethread the needle but we

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.469 
will have to rethread the needle but we
can<00:02:03.649> make<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.250> rest<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.850> threading

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
can make the rest of the threading

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.480 
can make the rest of the threading
process<00:02:06.490> simpler<00:02:07.660> by<00:02:08.660> using<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.130> thread

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
process simpler by using the thread

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.230 
process simpler by using the thread
that's<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:10.940> there<00:02:11.210> as<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.870> guide<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.670> before<00:02:14.060> we

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
that's in there as a guide so before we

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.970 
that's in there as a guide so before we
take<00:02:14.480> off<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> thread<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.350> don't<00:02:15.620> want<00:02:15.860> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
take off the thread we don't want to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.290 
take off the thread we don't want to
anymore<00:02:16.130> let's<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.760> pull<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.270> little

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
anymore let's just pull it a little

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.610 
anymore let's just pull it a little
extra

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
extra

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
extra

on this side of the bobbin again we're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.089 
on this side of the bobbin again we're
gonna<00:02:24.040> gently<00:02:25.040> pull<00:02:25.580> off<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.120> thread<00:02:26.540> spool

we have a little knot here that little
knot<00:03:26.250> most<00:03:26.640> likely<00:03:27.120> will<00:03:27.270> not<00:03:27.420> pass<00:03:27.750> through

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

right there so let's pull our thread and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.560 
right there so let's pull our thread and
see<00:03:39.960> how<00:03:40.110> far<00:03:40.380> it'll<00:03:40.560> go<00:03:43.910> very<00:03:44.910> gently<00:03:45.360> and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
see how far it'll go very gently and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.680 
see how far it'll go very gently and
slowly<00:03:45.780> no<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:47.190> won't<00:03:47.400> go<00:03:47.520> through<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.910> needle

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.930 

but<00:03:51.690> will<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.980> us<00:03:53.130> through<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.460> little

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
but will get us through that little

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.290 
but will get us through that little
guide<00:03:54.150> under<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.690> needle<00:03:54.990> arm<00:03:55.850> which<00:03:56.850> is

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
guide under the needle arm which is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.230 
guide under the needle arm which is
time-consuming<00:04:02.030> okay

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
time-consuming okay

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.140 
time-consuming okay
so<00:04:03.990> now<00:04:04.140> what<00:04:04.320> we<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.650> left<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.250> again<00:04:05.880> is
