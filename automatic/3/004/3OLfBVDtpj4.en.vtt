 functional methods and mixed methods in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.660
 What are traditional methods? 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.489
 analytical 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.040
 are those who oppose the methods 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.200

 18th century with the eminent pedagogue ovidio 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.640
 decroly this method called global part

 of the following principles perception 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.300

 traditional and functional to create 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.610
 a non - pure method that takes into account the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.410
 analysis and synthesis processes for 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.660
 develop phonological awareness and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.460

 Dr. Maria Montessori psychiatrist and 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 Italian pedagogue create a method

 sensory association to read and

 done individually in what 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.930
 consists of the functional method and

 communicative in reading and writing

 psycholinguistics and other disciplines 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.170
 pose the topic as approaches approaches 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.430
 Interactive reading and writing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 the basic principles of the approach 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 functional and communicative are integral 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 contextual and functional what are the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190
 five principles of the functional approach and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.170
 communicative for linuesa and domínguez 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.730
 they are the language is an activity 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.350
 focused on the meaning the language 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 oral and written are learned in contexts 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.980
 read speak write and listen are 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.540
 integrated aspects of the language 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.730
 language is learned integrated and then 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.050
 differentiated last the language is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.330
 learn through practices and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 linguistic skills what are the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.750
 general internal and external factors 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.000
 that favor the learning of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 Reading and writing 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 the internal factors are the type 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.010
 organic the mental and the affective 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 the external factors are 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.670
 sociocultural family and school 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.080
 what are the specific factors that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.810
 they influence the learning of 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.280
 literacy the cerebral predominance of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.080
 the laterality of human right hand 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.910
 left the auditory acuity the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.550
 spatial organization and to locate the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.740
 objects top down right left 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.900
 etcetera and finally the organization 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.790
 Temporal rhythmic where space and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 time are inseparable and structured 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.959
 parallel and to finish what 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.810
 are the best ideas to generate a 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.520
 good reading and writing program 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.440
 I understand that it is necessary to generate 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.660
 innovative programs where reading 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.920
 be the protagonist generate a model of 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.690
 interactive reading that generates 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.459
 understanding to have a list of books 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.830
 recommended to read every day during 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.239
 15 minutes create readers' clubs 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.430
 books and celebrate the international day 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.250
 of the book and the reading with days 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.569
 recital workshops and competitions in order 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.870
 to achieve promote the book and reading 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.910
