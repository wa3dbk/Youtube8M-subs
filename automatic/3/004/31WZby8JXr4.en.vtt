where<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.570> took<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.890> pants<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.369> down

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
where I took in the pants right down

where I took in the pants right down
along<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> bottom<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> pocket<00:02:02.610> here

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
along to the bottom of the pocket here

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.840 
along to the bottom of the pocket here
and<00:02:03.229> up<00:02:04.229> along<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.829> seam<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> that's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and up along this seam and that's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
and up along this seam and that's
essentially<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.719> did<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.350> cinched<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
essentially all I did was I cinched it

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.010 
essentially all I did was I cinched it
in<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> pocket<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.390> when<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.629> stood<00:02:09.869> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
in from the pocket and when I'm stood up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
in from the pocket and when I'm stood up
it<00:02:10.200> doesn't<00:02:10.379> even<00:02:10.590> look<00:02:10.830> bunchy<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> see

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it doesn't even look bunchy you can see

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
it doesn't even look bunchy you can see
a<00:02:12.120> little<00:02:12.510> tiny<00:02:12.840> pleat<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.530> down

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a little tiny pleat going down

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
a little tiny pleat going down
to<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> pocket<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.870> hardly

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
to the pocket there and it's hardly

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.320 
to the pocket there and it's hardly
noticeable<00:02:16.740> self<00:02:17.780> alright<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> did<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
noticeable self alright what I did was I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.199 
noticeable self alright what I did was I
just<00:02:21.870> found<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.830> scene<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.459> runs<00:02:23.730> along<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
just found the scene that runs along the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.860 
just found the scene that runs along the
pocket<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.690> hope<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:27.209> was

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
pocket I hope you can see this and I was

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.540 
pocket I hope you can see this and I was
really<00:02:28.170> lucky<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:28.800> belt<00:02:29.069> loop<00:02:29.160> is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
really lucky because my belt loop is

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.030 
really lucky because my belt loop is
actually<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.630> inch<00:02:30.930> which<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.500> what<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.800> need

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually one inch which is what I need

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.440 
actually one inch which is what I need
on<00:02:32.190> each<00:02:32.340> side<00:02:32.640> from<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:34.020> seam<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
on each side from that seam and so I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.360 
on each side from that seam and so I
could<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:36.990> follow<00:02:37.380> along<00:02:37.650> with<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> belt

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
could just follow along with the belt

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.100 
could just follow along with the belt
loop<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> did<00:02:40.700> all<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.989> I'm

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
is take this belt loop and pinch it down

is take this belt loop and pinch it down
to<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.140> seam<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.459> runs<00:02:53.670> along

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
to this seam right here that runs along

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.390 
to this seam right here that runs along
the<00:02:54.150> outer<00:02:54.300> edge<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.810> pocket<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.070> you're

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and now you want to taper the pants as

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.570 
and now you want to taper the pants as
they<00:03:09.959> go<00:03:10.140> along<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.769> really<00:03:10.980> easy<00:03:11.280> with

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
they go along and it's really easy with

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.250 
they go along and it's really easy with
a<00:03:11.640> corduroy<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.900> sort<00:03:13.140> of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
a corduroy because you can sort of

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.280 
a corduroy because you can sort of
follow<00:03:13.640> along<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.410> seam<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> all<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.660> did<00:03:18.900> was

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
follow along the seam so all I did was

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.220 
follow along the seam so all I did was
pinch<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.829> along<00:03:20.130> down<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> pocket<00:03:21.150> until<00:03:24.230> I'm

wondering<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.430> until<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
wondering if you can see this until the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.110 
wondering if you can see this until the
whole<00:03:27.570> thing<00:03:27.870> has<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.530> little<00:03:29.160> pleat<00:03:29.730> all<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
whole thing has a little pleat all the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.300 
whole thing has a little pleat all the
way<00:03:30.209> down<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> seam<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.769> can<00:03:32.070> pin

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
way down the seam here now you can pin

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.729 
way down the seam here now you can pin
it<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:32.790> stage<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.510> want<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.680> you

don't<00:03:35.070> have<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.970> don't<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:36.930> pull<00:03:37.530> it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
don't have to I don't I just pull it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.009 
don't have to I don't I just pull it
back<00:03:37.680> into<00:03:38.070> shape<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.880> go<00:03:39.090> cuz<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.480> hand<00:03:39.750> sew

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
back into shape as I go cuz I hand sew

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.870 
back into shape as I go cuz I hand sew
so<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.100> all<00:03:41.340> I'm<00:03:41.459> gonna<00:03:41.640> do<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:43.820> take<00:03:44.820> my

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
so then all I'm gonna do is take my

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.870 
so then all I'm gonna do is take my
needle<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.390> thread<00:03:49.100> pinch<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.310> back<00:03:50.549> into

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
needle and thread pinch that back into

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.199 
needle and thread pinch that back into
place<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.150> sort<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> hide<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:52.620> close<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.400> or

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
place and sort of hide it as close to or

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.420 
place and sort of hide it as close to or
under<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.780> belt<00:03:54.989> loop<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.590> possibly<00:03:56.100> can

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
under the belt loop as you possibly can

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.740 
under the belt loop as you possibly can
so<00:03:57.890> what<00:03:58.890> you'll<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.340> an<00:03:59.670> overlap<00:04:00.180> right

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
so what you'll have is an overlap right

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.190 
so what you'll have is an overlap right
here<00:04:01.320> next<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> your<00:04:02.340> belt<00:04:02.579> loop<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
here next to your belt loop and it's the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.080 
here next to your belt loop and it's the
same<00:04:04.410> thickness<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:05.070> your<00:04:05.280> belt<00:04:05.430> loop<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:05.850> you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
same thickness as your belt loop so you

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
same thickness as your belt loop so you
don't<00:04:06.269> even<00:04:06.390> notice<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:06.989> I'll<00:04:07.350> just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
don't even notice it and I'll just

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.680 
don't even notice it and I'll just
stitch<00:04:08.370> along<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.700> top<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:09.450> dish<00:04:09.660> that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
stitch along the top to this dish that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.870 
stitch along the top to this dish that
right<00:04:10.049> back<00:04:10.230> into<00:04:10.500> place<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.340> started<00:04:11.760> off

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
right back into place but I started off

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.380 
right back into place but I started off
with<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:12.390> come<00:04:12.750> underneath<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.820> fold<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.269> I

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
with a come underneath the fold that I

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.039 
with a come underneath the fold that I
just<00:04:15.600> made<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.239> got<00:04:18.390> an<00:04:18.539> end<00:04:18.780> of

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
just made and if you got an end of

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.509 
just made and if you got an end of
thread<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:19.680> sticking<00:04:19.919> out<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.370> that

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
thread that's sticking out like that

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.790 
thread that's sticking out like that
just<00:04:20.820> hook<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.180> down<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.959> that'll<00:04:22.349> get<00:04:22.590> sewn

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
just hook that down and that'll get sewn

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.550 
just hook that down and that'll get sewn
right<00:04:23.130> into<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.910> that's<00:04:24.120> not<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> problem

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
right into it that's not a problem

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.690 
right into it that's not a problem
then<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:27.660> start<00:04:27.930> stitching<00:04:28.230> by<00:04:28.610> pulling<00:04:29.610> up

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
then just start stitching by pulling up

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.629 
then just start stitching by pulling up
a<00:04:29.880> little<00:04:30.120> piece<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.600> fiber<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
a little piece of the fiber here and

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.070 
a little piece of the fiber here and
grabbing<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.880> little<00:04:33.450> piece<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.840> fiber

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
grabbing a little piece of the fiber

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.220 
grabbing a little piece of the fiber
there<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:36.300> you're<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:36.690> stitching<00:04:37.080> I

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
there so and you're just stitching I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.780 
there so and you're just stitching I
don't<00:04:37.440> know<00:04:37.560> names<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:38.070> stitches<00:04:38.460> or<00:04:38.610> anything

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
don't know names of stitches or anything

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.370 
don't know names of stitches or anything
like<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.950> just<00:04:40.950> do<00:04:41.940> whatever<00:04:42.380> these

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
like that I just just do whatever these

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.950 
like that I just just do whatever these
these<00:04:43.650> hide<00:04:43.950> in<00:04:44.190> really<00:04:44.520> well<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
these hide in really well so so

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.629 
these hide in really well so so
essentially<00:04:46.410> that's<00:04:46.800> all<00:04:47.010> you're<00:04:47.190> doing<00:04:47.520> is

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
essentially that's all you're doing is

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.970 
essentially that's all you're doing is
grabbing<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.240> along<00:04:48.480> like<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.980> pulling

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
grabbing it along like this and pulling

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.180 
grabbing it along like this and pulling
down<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.810> don't<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.500> stitch<00:04:55.860> here

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
down and you don't see this stitch here

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
down and you don't see this stitch here
so<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:56.970> pick<00:04:57.270> up<00:04:57.450> two<00:04:57.990> little<00:04:58.290> pieces<00:04:58.500> of

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
so you pick up two little pieces of

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.790 
so you pick up two little pieces of
fabric<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.950> pull<00:05:02.700> down<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.419> you<00:05:04.290> continue

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
fabric and pull down and you continue

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.409 
fabric and pull down and you continue
right<00:05:05.010> on<00:05:05.190> down<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.850> bottom<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.389> your

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
right on down to the bottom of your

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.540 
right on down to the bottom of your
pocket<00:05:06.960> like<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.440> remember<00:05:07.919> as<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.400> go

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
pocket like this I remember as you go

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.540 
pocket like this I remember as you go
down<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:09.120> towards<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.260> pocket<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:11.220> want<00:05:11.370> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.670 
down to towards the pocket you want to
taper<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.150> in<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:12.690> then<00:05:13.229> when<00:05:13.500> you're<00:05:13.650> all

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
