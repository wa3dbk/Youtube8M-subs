 everyone spends kids on this 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
 brand new video on minecraft a common 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.900
 guys another episode of this 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.150
 series that you like so much erni fa 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 a lot of pleasure to me boy too 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.199
 not to have a command block 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 really very very interesting and a lot 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 very son who adds several 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.539
 functionality minecraft functionality that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 there are features in quotes there is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.310
 in fact this one is called shoulders 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.050
 of robero spy gear or some case 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.490
 either way you see it now at 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 guys as always you need to slash 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
 lives snail piva oman dash 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 lower blog to give us our 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.219
 beautiful command block up 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.620
 to the ace we set boqore a from the peak of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
 in front we go to copy the command that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 I leave you obviously in description 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.969
 let's get it done and let's activate the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 command block that actually goes 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.829
 to create all the coolest machine 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 watch it cool that it is being built 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 it is always beautiful to look at what it is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.949
 human command and without without 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.660
 present there are no signs that type 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.850
 they give us items and various things but we must 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 take the name from the creative or ce ne 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.939
 let's look for everything that anyway 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.740
 they are very much net materials from 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 recover and then we leave immediately with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 the most boys who are shoes like you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 There are four to crafting business has 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 the first thing to do are the spybots or 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.080
 shoes with leather boots is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 a compass and the network will be there 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 spybot andiamole to wear these spy 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.970
 bus will make us first lie down totally 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.250
 on the ground if you look at that cool, that is me 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.890
 I'm a customer at one block we want 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 cross this wall so just that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 we lower ourselves so we can do it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.659
 look at us, that fucking cool already 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.579
 this is really something 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.740
 amazing other thing they do these 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.400
 facebook girls inside 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 of the bushes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 ok i also created a bush because 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.009
 I forgot to do it, but these dicks 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
 as we said before we can hide ourselves 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.520
 boys in the bushes and there is enough to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 jump on it and automatically there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.049
 we'll hide in the bushes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.000
 guys is really cool because 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.649
 reds has precisely hide us that can 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 get inside the vegetation in 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.450
 minecraft then maybe go out say 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 hi is killing you years in school i 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.799
 boys the second object that also a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.959
 fantastic object guys that is the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.790
 laser that works in all directions 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.550
 active an alarm then to sound 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.550
 this phase 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.380
 yes you have to put a distributor is one 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.240
 rocci stone of guys this laser 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.100
 bim that's really cool while 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.500
 can place guys this laser 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.460
 look who is fucking cool and does 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 this ray is if we go inside it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.430
 activates this sound alarm that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.040
 really really cool guys one 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.080
 absurd thing that is cool to look at 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.270
 this case and kids is possible 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 block it through the i blocks 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720
 blocks that are not transparent 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.000
 so obviously if I went to put 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.470
 for example the laser ready wood this 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.300
 is obviously interrupted if me 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.530
 pass the alarm does not activate if however 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.570
 guys wanted for example 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.330
 to interrupt it at this point is wanted 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.310
 put some glass maybe to do for 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 make this hidden trap 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.220
 I just veto it is practically 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.450
 the glass is crossed 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.490
 quietly from a boys thing 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.020
 really absurd another thing 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.270
 very cool about this side and boys is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.610
 clear practically when it comes 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.100
 crossed generates an electrical impulse 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.500
 practically as if we were doing this 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.840
 so so guys is so over 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.610
 to make a sonorous alarm 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.590
 we can also make an alarm a 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.810
 visual alarm in the sense that being in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.290
 we go through an alarm torches yes 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.400
 really turn on a fucking guys 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.620
 cool you want what we can do 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.630
 guys with this laser is combined 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 the spice can virtually 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.830
 go under it but as said he created 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.570
 this construction with the laser between 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.910
 hidden quotes are behind the glass 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.610
 very simple to make myself very clear 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.400
 passed without lowering me boys like 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.870
 network the alarm is activated is good but if 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.540
 go and use of course I explain 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 I can safely evade the laser is 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.870
 going under there is this is one thing 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.090
 absolutely fantastic guys it is 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.680
 really very much pussy else 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.050
 mechanism that we can create boys 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.550
 there are some to exploit this laser 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.290
 really a fucking guys i'm doing 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.780
 see the simplest ones ie before 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.940
 disable the laser when 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500
 the first will be through a 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.690
 first time then in this case I do it 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.450
 I'm going to disappoint quietly but if 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.390
 we are passing it boys and consistent the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.090
 laser turns this off with thanks 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.560
 this is really a mechanism 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 stupid thanks to this use of 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.850
 piston boys like net is connected to 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.470
 laser itself as soon as it comes 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.190
 crossed moves the piston the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.020
 exposed piston that block is 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.000
 block present or strips the stem e 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.040
 laser makes us understand that precisely laser is 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.920
 the apology was activated by someone 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.440
 what to cast guys is the tracker 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.930
 in quotation marks and scratches with 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.490
 coal is the gunpowder for 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.400
 nothing will give us this new one 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.290
 it is called an art footprint 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.820
 because I made the sand base because 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.250
 you notice a lot much more on the sand 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.530
 guys we're practically going to spit 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.170
 this new note on an area of ​​the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.940
 game here you see customer will teach us 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.560
 the tracks when we pass on that 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.000
 certain field we will leave you i 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.380
 steps if I for example went to 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.840
 walk in this area girl who 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.820
 you can see I left mine on the ground 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.010
 tracks and it's really a fantastic thing 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.080
 we can practically do it on all 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.460
 surfaces I preferred to do it in that 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.290
 of sand because in that of sand 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.480
 you can see a lot more guys here 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.580
 but the last is really very little 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.050
 what to pick up guys is the cart 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.790
 elevator I call it that because 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.010
 actually a fucking dog 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.650
 elevator that kraft has with a lever is 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.360
 a twine saw boys crafting 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.770
 all the casting are very simple yes 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.180
 they can also fly over without 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.250
 too many problems then we have this 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.410
 spy bunch guys this precisely a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.690
 elevator that we have to go to test 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.280
 obviously on the bases we want 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.260
 reaching for example will have to place 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.820
 this forklift here guys 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.669
 now I went there in three boys 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.810
 I only need to go up to go up 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.780
 up to go down 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.150
 It's enough for me as you can see going down with 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.310
 with the udc or the visual then just that 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.810
 we will make it there the cart stays there 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.730
 where it is as you can see there is this 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.800
 effect that looks like string 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.870
 that pulled the cart and come back to me 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.270
 just pick up the cart and aim 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.320
 upwards he is totally up in 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.270
 automatic plus as well as guys for this 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.490
 one koman was all I miss really 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.020
 really very complete guys and a lot 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.300
 very cool maybe the coolest he has 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.830
 done after dinner bond really a lot 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.690
 especially useful this car and 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.669
 guys that really is something 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.169
 unbelievable how silvio you look like 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.060
 keep quiet or a nice holes are his boys 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.250
 let me know below forests maybe 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.320
 other videos dedicated to ATMs e 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.500
 resolute has understood that everything is hello 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.500
 Hello
