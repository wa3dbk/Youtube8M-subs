00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 alexey first I would like to congratulate 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 you with a momentous victory and in so 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.220
 tense battle now finally 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.010
 there was a man who can be called 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 the winners of the monson of the wrestler which 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 won like like but how that is all 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.580
 it was ambiguous now finally you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.289
 held a fight after which no one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 can say that Monson lost 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.810
 somehow doubtfully well I hope neither 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.330
 who does not have questions yes I 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 I tried to do everything that I could think 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.810
 that executed the plan very well which 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.340
 I was there who helped me 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.170
 coach my team 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 and all young and thank you thank you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 First of all, and I would like to ask 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 this plan was developed by some of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.230
 your workout whether it was a general plan 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 your team, I sent a general plan 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.079
 that is, my wife was mate 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.629
 partners but I will repeat with me very 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 it looks like the plan was for the first fight and he didn't 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
 only due to the fact that I am very 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.050
 for a long time did not train before 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.270
 by that fight, that is, I was not the elder 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.760
 partners i worked at all get ready for 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.979
 to that fights exactly month and after one and a half 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 somewhere two year even without a break 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.590
 workouts 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.090
 ready to troop myself to me 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.070
 the main stream it was and the white circle 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 home white steps up down 7 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 sky not sparring partners low 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 work is not a little I spent there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 groups on this 57 workouts before 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.570
 the fight that is, after a year and a half 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 break that is practically but 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.080
 very little 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 it is clear that you have perfectly fulfilled your 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 plan you realized your advantage in 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.960
 striking technique and you neutralized 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.990
 Monson wrestler advantage in his 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.870
 attempts to pass into the legs that you are all 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 repulsed and timely suffocated 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.150
 after he's already lost well this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 I thought it was the best outcome for me 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.050
 duel when to win such a great 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 without exaggeration the wrestler mushroom with the world 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.500
 the level of which they were afraid to fight all that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.080
 have daniel karma and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.270
 Fedor Emelianenko many other struggles 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.580
 just didn't climb some that didn't 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.320
 magnified to some self but it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.960
 personally, my plank is not for someone there 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.239
 a strap there someone could be able to do 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 better there or more but what i am for 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.350
 put yourself huge for me 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.570
 achievements thank god vlada recipe 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.950
 he has this lipstick 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.320
 can not agree with you as 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.450
 objectively Monson is a very strong fighter and 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.870
 now since your level has risen 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 The above question is, do you want to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.769
 for example, fight Alexander 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.500
 Emelyanenko but I think it will solve 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.209
 for the most part my team I need 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.030
 moment anyway with whom to fight something and yours 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.030
 the photo was a fighter with a good name and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.579
 not double digit that is whether to him there 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.569
 there is such and such 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.120
 uniquely strong good fighter and with 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.219
 somehow rated world meaning 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.409
 decently I don't seem to have a blade 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.230
 in the world ranking was recorded under 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.530
 number 27 now was jeff monson too 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.609
 He in the first ten there I do not know 20 30 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.269
 I do nâ€™t remember places there 6 42 here is very 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.819
 world ranking 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.480
 I am proud that I got it and 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.000
 grateful 777 then helped me on this 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.950

 fighter and that I would like to ask you 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.859
 Do you like your life to you and if it is difficult to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.230
 you would reach such a life a life very 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.079
 not easy but it is very interesting 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.340
 live quietly bags modestly and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.700
 live well 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.410
 and you can live very much 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.709
 moving work a lot at a time 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.260
 doing business with a family with a team 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.660
 developing there some big volume 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.830
 work I don't work there striving after all 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.849
 everywhere a network of people that is, we work 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.739
 we raise 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.450
 Well, I think we are very helpful. 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.110
 raise sport in Ukraine in particular 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.610
 there is a funny gabor sabo and without rules then 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.680
 there is the bar that we took this 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.390
 the tempo that is it is very high and us 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.810
 the main thing is to keep it up I will try 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.030
 to make a feasible contribution to this 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.579
 you tell our viewers youth and not 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.799
 only to all fighters that dare and your 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.990
 life, too, can all turn out to dare 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.919
 look at some premiere look 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.600
 look at Fedor Emelianenko at others 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.750
 world class guys 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.900
 and it's often much more honorable then 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.190
 there are many people even have such 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.120
 who are earning a lot of money and expense 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 that but they are not respected or no one 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.870
 knows something else to be a sample 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.520
 a hero there for someone that is this very 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.390
 inspires them help them a lot 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.100
 changes other people's lives for the better 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.960
 someone there account banks such there 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.020
 so much drowned and yes and it is not known how 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.760
 someone is standing on a pedestal there with a belt 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.370
 with the cup still something about him saying 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.600
 everyone does not admire this beautiful strong 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.390
 this country pride there 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.440
 proud of something else, and then strongly and for 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.500
 It is worth not training this week and 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.420
 months and years what do we of course know about 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.640
 than speak and I would like to finally 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.710
 congratulate you on your not that victory 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.710
 with your triumph 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.710
