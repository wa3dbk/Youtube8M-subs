00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.510
 but 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.930
 to close the party that is the same as this work states 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.410
 that's what gave to those who are fans of the adversary just for who wants to be 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.259
 perceived as someone of great taste in any civil meeting 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.810
 as in the 2010 Formula 1 season despite being a more 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.850
 makes it much faster than its competitors 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.160
 but of course with a dual-core processor its performance is 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.950
 significantly better than the traditional one and 270 know that for 90% of 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.520
 market netbooks 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.130
 This is most easily noticed in multitasking execution but nothing that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.080
 can be considered exceptional whether they want it or not it remains a 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.880
 netbook it comes from factory with windows operating system is good premium 64 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.010
 bits and has ram memory of 2gb at write-offs of 320 counts as 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.290
 I have said before is not the configuration that would make it yesterday 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.820
 stabbed for another 5 years and lower to begin with it is clear that a 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.370
 netbook scenario that sells the reds being bigger with the same paint 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.670
 applied in their positions its size is also not well what is usually seen 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.979
 among netbooks getting a bit above average with 11 1 point 6 screen 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.020
 inches 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.970
 is a land this morning the keyboard also gained more space and was well 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.250
 more comfortable to work for longer periods 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.190
 the yellow jack's phone appears on both the external cover and the base of the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.700
 keyboard on the right side 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.260
 some other little details remind you at all times because 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.490
 is with a blacksmith in the hands author of the first goal the latter on the way out 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.500
 of the internet connection locker one on each side for example in addition to a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.020
 very cool business that few people repair 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.039
 the support rubbers at the moment 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.370
 according to the risks of a tire 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.920
 to complete a thing that appeals to a few years of age others its design 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.710
 is that there was created an almost invisible late track with a panic button 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 is only limited by the texture differentiation at the base of the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 keyboard just to finish on the forms as I said it is nothing 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.010
 phenomenal but the use experience is very positive it is lightweight and not beijing 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.570
 warm up did not catch on a task even opening several programs at the same time 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.660
 that I am jealous he has the independents and we have had only stay one 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.959
 a little better 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.360
 he thought he would find interesting shapes very quietly for 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.450
 three-and-a-half hours of full-screen movie projection for navigation 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.670
 on the Internet 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.580
 and use in other everyday tasks that do not require as much discreet brightness 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.289
 It has to last much longer.
