00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.210
 Vasily asked me where did the water come from 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.210
 falls under Shumkov 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.160
 two holes where the mats are attached 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.160
 mats were mounted more precisely 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.460
 Now that's going on here at the crease 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:30.420
 carpet that is put on top here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.040
 here here goes the crack for soundproofing 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.520
 exactly the same 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.520
 passenger side 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 if antifreeze is spilled from our stove 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.309
 she's a bitch glad runs down on Shumkov 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.969
 engine compartment under 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:57.420
 Shumkov which is on the floor plus the mass of all 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.910
 good holes here for example or 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:07.159
 here it is a pedal stop that's just 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.380
 lock in the corner 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.210
 Shumka does not enter permissible like in the old 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.810
 machines on the wall it just lies along 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 here it is not clear why it was done 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.680
 could put the pedal on top of this 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.950
 bracket and calm he was he here 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950
 was standing 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.450
 despite the fact that this is covering 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.579
 it is water resistant at least 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 holds back moisture 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.899
 when she watered she cleaned this area 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 water flowed from it did not miss 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:51.299
 almost black matter was dry but 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 during operation , such 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.380
 cracks at the joints here in these places there 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.330
 where we put our legs in these places 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.060
 right here in the middle from the back 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.899
 the whole surface on which is usually 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 rely we step on such cracks 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.239
 when used to clean 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.140
 carpet 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.579
 automotive was visible as a composition 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 appeared through these cracks 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.829
 of the reverse side 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:31.200
 here it is wet 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:33.910
 carpet from the inside but naturally save us 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.950
 mats in my case this car 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.319
 french here apparently either 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.290
 there were no rugs or rugs to someone 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.000
 sold separately here were mats 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.190
 completely flat ie caverns 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.850
 which now you can buy ships no one 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.329
 not established 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.880
 so in any case check it out 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.970
 difficult to lift one bar and slip 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 hand see is dry summer but if wet 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.870
 you can just put what I have 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 will show later 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.110
 such napkins or pads 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:34.440
 in short, my business was to warn yours 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.440
 get scared and do it right
