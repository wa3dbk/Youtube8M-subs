like to turn that up till I get a really

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.119 
like to turn that up till I get a really

too<00:00:52.339> high<00:00:52.659> back<00:00:53.659> it<00:00:53.839> off<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> little<00:00:54.229> bit<00:00:54.470> you

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
too high back it off a little bit you

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.240 
too high back it off a little bit you
see<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.600> like<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.839> solid<00:00:57.229> green<00:00:57.439> and<00:00:57.710> slowly<00:00:58.040> to

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
see I like the solid green and slowly to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.759 
see I like the solid green and slowly to
break<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.670> I'll<00:00:59.600> usually<00:01:00.229> go<00:01:00.409> anywhere

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
break it I'll usually go anywhere

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.640 
break it I'll usually go anywhere
between<00:01:00.949> 30<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.699> 40<00:01:02.360> here<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:02.869> 32<00:01:03.259> it<00:01:03.500> looks

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
between 30 to 40 here so 32 it looks

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.580 
between 30 to 40 here so 32 it looks
pretty<00:01:03.890> good<00:01:04.040> in<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.369> backend

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.830 

I<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:08.579> to<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.820> into<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> gain<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> make<00:01:09.720> sure

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I like to go into my gain and make sure

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
I like to go into my gain and make sure
that's<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.229> auto<00:01:10.530> right<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's on auto right here it's not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
that's on auto right here it's not
opalescent<00:01:11.909> wanna<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.720> straight<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
opalescent wanna go straight back to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.310 
opalescent wanna go straight back to
auto<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.640> auto<00:01:14.790> gain<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> NSS<00:01:15.750> Evo<00:01:16.049> 2<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
auto the auto gain on the NSS Evo 2 is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
auto the auto gain on the NSS Evo 2 is
fantastic<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.189> increase<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> power<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
fantastic it will increase the power the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
fantastic it will increase the power the
gain<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.689> deeper<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> decreasing<00:01:19.829> as

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
gain as we go deeper and decreasing as

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
gain as we go deeper and decreasing as
we<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.340> shallower<00:01:20.700> automatically<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> never

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
we go shallower automatically so I never

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.100 
we go shallower automatically so I never
have<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> touch<00:01:23.360> next<00:01:24.360> thing<00:01:24.539> I<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
have to touch next thing I like to do is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.249 
have to touch next thing I like to do is
it<00:01:25.259> advanced<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.490> time<00:01:26.820> variable<00:01:27.360> gain<00:01:27.689> okay

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it advanced this time variable gain okay

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
it advanced this time variable gain okay
what<00:01:28.979> it'll<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> raise<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
what it'll do is as I raise it it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
what it'll do is as I raise it it
removes<00:01:31.860> any<00:01:32.220> trash<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.420> higher<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.899> the

all my other returns are in there so one
is<00:01:45.899> high<00:01:46.080> enough<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.709> as<00:01:46.770> high<00:01:46.860> as

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
is high enough I will go as high as

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.029 
is high enough I will go as high as
three<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.429> that<00:01:47.610> sometime<00:01:48.200> things<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.439> cranked

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it up max all the way puts more power

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.660 
it up max all the way puts more power
into<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> water<00:01:53.580> I<00:01:53.849> won't<00:01:54.479> miss<00:01:54.599> any<00:01:54.810> returns

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
into the water I won't miss any returns

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.059 
into the water I won't miss any returns
range<00:01:56.670> since<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.780> Auto<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.349> now<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
range since I'm Auto right now but if I

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.589 
range since I'm Auto right now but if I
know<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.310> gonna<00:01:59.429> be<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> certain<00:02:00.030> depth<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
know I'm gonna be in a certain depth I

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.789 
know I'm gonna be in a certain depth I
usually<00:02:01.530> take<00:02:01.709> it<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.330> right<00:02:03.330> here<00:02:03.799> we

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
usually take it out of all right here we

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.999 
usually take it out of all right here we
go<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.009> 40<00:02:05.750> obviously<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> bottom<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.259> off<00:02:07.409> 60

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
go to 40 obviously the bottom is off 60

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.279 
go to 40 obviously the bottom is off 60
