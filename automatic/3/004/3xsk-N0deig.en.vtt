now<00:02:13.630> there's<00:02:14.110> no<00:02:14.319> point<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.490> really<00:02:15.790> not

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
now there's no point this is really not

a<00:02:16.690> major<00:02:17.170> major<00:02:17.830> concern<00:02:18.760> more<00:02:19.330> important<00:02:20.140> I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
a major major concern more important I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.260 
a major major concern more important I
think<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.160> really<00:02:21.400> need<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> drive

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
think this you really need a drive

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.350 
think this you really need a drive
carefully<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.340> cases<00:02:24.640> since<00:02:25.150> it's

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
carefully but in this cases since it's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.050 
carefully but in this cases since it's
not<00:02:25.540> my<00:02:25.810> fault<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.680> more<00:02:27.069> important<00:02:27.819> than

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
not my fault what is more important than

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.630 
not my fault what is more important than
this<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.690> thought<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.709> point<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.610> should

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
this I thought is this point you should

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.030 
this I thought is this point you should
