we're<00:00:09.880> going<00:00:10.030> to<00:00:10.269> be<00:00:10.389> assessing<00:00:10.750> the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
we're going to be assessing the

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.930 
we're going to be assessing the
playability<00:00:11.380> of<00:00:11.620> your<00:00:11.889> instrument<00:00:12.339> basically

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
playability of your instrument basically

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.480 
playability of your instrument basically
making<00:00:13.240> sure<00:00:13.419> the<00:00:13.839> guitar<00:00:14.200> is<00:00:14.349> playing<00:00:14.709> the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
making sure the guitar is playing the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.400 
making sure the guitar is playing the
way<00:00:15.669> that<00:00:15.879> it's<00:00:15.999> designed<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.420> perform<00:00:16.810> there

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
way that it's designed to perform there

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.609 
way that it's designed to perform there
are<00:00:17.500> basically<00:00:17.920> three<00:00:18.400> parts<00:00:18.789> to<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.030> setup<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
are basically three parts to a setup the

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.460 
are basically three parts to a setup the
first<00:00:20.650> being<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.640> nut<00:00:22.060> slot<00:00:22.300> depth<00:00:22.720> the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
first being the nut slot depth the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.740 
first being the nut slot depth the
second<00:00:23.920> being<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.189> relief<00:00:24.730> in<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.240> neck<00:00:25.480> and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
second being the relief in the neck and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.830 
second being the relief in the neck and
the<00:00:26.410> third<00:00:26.740> being<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.519> saddle<00:00:28.000> height<00:00:28.179> now

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
the third being the saddle height now

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.320 
the third being the saddle height now
the<00:00:28.900> first<00:00:29.259> thing<00:00:29.500> I'll<00:00:29.650> look<00:00:29.890> at<00:00:30.130> any<00:00:30.429> time<00:00:31.300> I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
the first thing I'll look at any time I

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.800 
the first thing I'll look at any time I
see<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.750> guitar<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:33.550> eyes<00:00:33.730> directly<00:00:34.450> go<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.690> the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
see a guitar my eyes directly go to the

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.290 
see a guitar my eyes directly go to the
saddle<00:00:35.230> because<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.400> saddle<00:00:36.790> height<00:00:36.970> tells

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
saddle because the saddle height tells

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.240 
saddle because the saddle height tells
me<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:37.750> lot<00:00:38.080> of<00:00:38.290> different<00:00:38.620> things<00:00:38.770> whether<00:00:39.070> or

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
me a lot of different things whether or

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.430 
me a lot of different things whether or
not<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.490> guitar<00:00:39.610> needs<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.090> neck<00:00:40.240> reset<00:00:40.720> where

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
not the guitar needs a neck reset where

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.620 
not the guitar needs a neck reset where
the<00:00:41.590> actions<00:00:42.040> at<00:00:42.250> gives<00:00:43.240> me<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.390> good<00:00:43.570> idea

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
the actions at gives me a good idea

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.420 
the actions at gives me a good idea
before<00:00:44.050> I<00:00:44.290> look<00:00:44.560> on<00:00:44.710> anything<00:00:44.980> else

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
before I look on anything else

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
before I look on anything else
so<00:00:45.880> our<00:00:46.740> saddle<00:00:47.740> height<00:00:47.890> spec<00:00:48.250> coming<00:00:49.210> out<00:00:49.330> of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
so our saddle height spec coming out of

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.510 
so our saddle height spec coming out of
the<00:00:49.510> factory<00:00:49.690> it's<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.230> minimum<00:00:50.740> of<00:00:50.890> three

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
the factory it's a minimum of three

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.000 
the factory it's a minimum of three
thirty<00:00:51.760> Seconds<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.540> maximum<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.380> five

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
thirty Seconds and a maximum of five

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.440 
thirty Seconds and a maximum of five
thirty<00:00:54.280> Seconds<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.150> want<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.360> be

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
thirty Seconds so you want to be

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.630 
thirty Seconds so you want to be
somewhere<00:00:55.840> within<00:00:56.080> that<00:00:56.200> range<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:57.190> now<00:00:57.310> after

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
somewhere within that range so now after

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.460 
somewhere within that range so now after
assessing<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.240> saddle<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.810> first<00:00:59.320> thing

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
assessing the saddle the first thing

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.080 
assessing the saddle the first thing
that<00:00:59.500> we're<00:00:59.680> going<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.860> look<00:01:00.010> at<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.460> regards

too<00:01:50.229> high<00:01:50.439> so<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.639> quick<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.030> easy<00:01:52.149> way<00:01:52.329> to

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
too high so the quick and easy way to

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.480 
too high so the quick and easy way to
check<00:01:52.749> that<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.289> by<00:01:53.889> taking<00:01:54.280> your<00:01:54.369> little

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
check that is by taking your little

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.279 
check that is by taking your little
finger<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:54.850> I'm<00:01:54.999> going<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.210> show<00:01:56.109> this

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
finger and I'm going to show this

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.200 
finger and I'm going to show this
example<00:01:56.799> using<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.249> low<00:01:57.399> E<00:01:57.429> string<00:01:57.609> but<00:01:58.119> you

example using the low E string but you
can<00:01:58.359> do<00:01:58.509> them<00:01:58.689> with<00:01:58.719> all<00:01:58.929> six<00:01:59.229> take<00:02:00.069> your

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
can do them with all six take your

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.279 
can do them with all six take your

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
down on the third fret and then with

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.820 
down on the third fret and then with
your<00:02:06.969> index<00:02:07.240> finger<00:02:07.389> you're<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.590> kind

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
your index finger you're going to kind

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.680 
your index finger you're going to kind
of<00:02:08.920> bounce<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.429> little<00:02:09.580> bit<00:02:09.850> in<00:02:10.060> between<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
of bounce a little bit in between the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.900 
of bounce a little bit in between the
nut<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.110> first<00:02:11.350> fret<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.890> what<00:02:12.790> you're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
nut in the first fret and what you're

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.630 
nut in the first fret and what you're
looking<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.930> want<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.380> string<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
looking for you want that string to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.280 
looking for you want that string to
bounce<00:02:15.850> off<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.480> first<00:02:16.810> fret

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
bounce off of that first fret

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.780 
bounce off of that first fret
about<00:02:18.569> 1/64<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> now<00:02:21.099> after<00:02:21.430> you're<00:02:21.519> assessing

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
about 1/64 so now after you're assessing

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.449 
about 1/64 so now after you're assessing
the<00:02:22.060> nut<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.590> we're<00:02:23.590> assuming<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.280> nut

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
the nut and we're assuming that the nut

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.880 
the nut and we're assuming that the nut
slots<00:02:24.730> are<00:02:24.909> okay<00:02:25.209> moving<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.409> next<00:02:26.769> thing

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
slots are okay moving on the next thing

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.110 
slots are okay moving on the next thing
that<00:02:26.920> we're<00:02:27.159> going<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> check<00:02:27.579> is<00:02:27.819> what<00:02:28.000> we

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that we're going to check is what we

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.569 
that we're going to check is what we
call<00:02:28.360> relief<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.290> neck<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.189> relief

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
call relief in the neck now the relief

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.699 
call relief in the neck now the relief
basically<00:02:31.180> means<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.930> hollow<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
basically means the hollow in the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.699 
basically means the hollow in the
fingerboard<00:02:33.430> from<00:02:34.209> about<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.569> first<00:02:34.870> fret<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
fingerboard from about the first fret to

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.520 
fingerboard from about the first fret to
about<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.069> twelfth<00:02:36.430> fret<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.200> easy<00:02:38.379> way

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
about the twelfth fret so the easy way

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.350 
about the twelfth fret so the easy way
to<00:02:38.680> check<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.459> you're<00:02:40.000> going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> take

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
to check that is you're going to take

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.390 
to check that is you're going to take
the<00:02:40.540> index<00:02:40.870> finger<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.349> your<00:02:41.590> left<00:02:41.709> hand<00:02:41.980> and

the index finger of your left hand and
again<00:02:42.819> you're<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.269> hold<00:02:43.480> down<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
again you're going to hold down on the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.589 
again you're going to hold down on the
first<00:02:45.340> fret<00:02:45.609> like<00:02:45.730> you're<00:02:45.909> playing<00:02:46.060> an<00:02:46.239> F<00:02:46.359> and

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
first fret like you're playing an F and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
index finger you're going to want to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.860 
index finger you're going to want to
bounce<00:03:01.180> around<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.930> seventh<00:03:02.530> fret<00:03:03.629> like<00:03:04.629> that

bounce around the seventh fret like that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.960 
bounce around the seventh fret like that
and<00:03:05.139> again<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.010> want<00:03:06.129> it<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.430> bounce<00:03:06.579> about

and again you want it to bounce about

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.110 
and again you want it to bounce about

business card in between the string and
the<00:03:14.560> fret<00:03:14.859> that's<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.819> clearance<00:03:16.209> that

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
the fret that's about the clearance that

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.089 
the fret that's about the clearance that
you<00:03:16.420> want<00:03:16.659> so<00:03:16.989> now<00:03:17.109> if<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.319> check<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
you want so now if you check this and

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.339 
you want so now if you check this and
you<00:03:18.280> find<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:19.030> string<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.510> bouncing<00:03:20.079> say

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
you find that the string is bouncing say

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.710 
you find that the string is bouncing say
that<00:03:20.590> much<00:03:20.829> then<00:03:21.699> your<00:03:21.849> fingerboard<00:03:22.180> needs<00:03:22.599> to

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
that much then your fingerboard needs to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.300 
that much then your fingerboard needs to
be<00:03:22.810> straighten<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.349> neck<00:03:23.530> has<00:03:23.739> too<00:03:23.949> much<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
be straighten the neck has too much of a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.780 
be straighten the neck has too much of a
hollow<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.879> so<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:26.040> would<00:03:27.040> recommend<00:03:27.190> again

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
hollow in it so I would recommend again

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.939 
hollow in it so I would recommend again

the bottom of the string and you can see
that<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.090> measures<00:04:45.510> right<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.160> 3/32<00:04:47.160> and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that that measures right on 3/32 and

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.510 
that that measures right on 3/32 and
then<00:04:47.880> measure<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> treble<00:04:48.660> side<00:04:49.520> you're

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
then measure on the treble side you're

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.250 
then measure on the treble side you're
going<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.090> same<00:04:51.270> thing<00:04:51.570> rested<00:04:52.080> on<00:04:52.170> the
