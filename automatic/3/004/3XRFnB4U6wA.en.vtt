00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
its place from the first year I was on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.160 
its place from the first year I was on
there<00:02:10.070> like<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> lot<00:02:11.480> more<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.870> do

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
there like it was a lot more we do

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.600 
there like it was a lot more we do
things<00:02:12.500> were<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> lot<00:02:12.800> more<00:02:13.010> tricky<00:02:13.400> and

things were a lot more tricky and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.730 
things were a lot more tricky and
obviously<00:02:14.600> didn't<00:02:14.840> know<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> water<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:15.530> well

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
like tiny orcs and stuff like that so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.060 
like tiny orcs and stuff like that so
it's<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:41.090> case<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.330> upscaling<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.650> deal

with it a little bit better and I

with it a little bit better and I

I<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.830> like<00:03:31.190> chopping<00:03:31.640> up<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.820> few<00:03:32.060> 15s<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:32.959> a

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
I was like chopping up a few 15s and a

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.660 
I was like chopping up a few 15s and a
few<00:03:33.470> fifties<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.160> there<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.519> they've<00:03:34.640> been

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
few fifties in there and they've been

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.729 
few fifties in there and they've been
ample<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.239> tens<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.690> some<00:03:35.930> twenties<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.590> I'm

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
ample of tens and some twenties and I'm

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.860 
ample of tens and some twenties and I'm
mixing<00:03:37.100> up<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.670> flavors<00:03:38.120> as<00:03:38.269> well<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.720> know

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.120 
mixing up the flavors as well you know
like<00:03:39.110> using<00:03:39.350> mbunda

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
like using mbunda

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.590 
like using mbunda
and<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.430> cold<00:03:40.640> water<00:03:40.880> mix<00:03:41.180> which<00:03:41.360> seemed<00:03:41.570> to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
and the cold water mix which seemed to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.690 
and the cold water mix which seemed to
work<00:03:41.840> really<00:03:42.049> well<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.799> honest<00:03:43.070> there<00:03:43.310> I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
work really well to be honest there I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.940 
work really well to be honest there I
mean<00:03:44.180> out<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.540> started<00:03:45.049> really<00:03:45.380> early<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.799> in

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
mean out that started really early on in

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.590

the<00:03:46.040> year<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.250> was<00:03:46.400> using<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.820> cold<00:03:47.030> water<00:03:47.269> mix

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
the year I was using the cold water mix

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.030 
the year I was using the cold water mix
and<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> was<00:03:47.959> catching<00:03:48.200> on<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.560> every<00:03:48.799> time<00:03:48.980> and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
and I was catching on it every time and

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.220 
and I was catching on it every time and
when<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.910> was<00:03:50.209> quite<00:03:50.420> reluctant<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.989> change

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
when so I was quite reluctant to change

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.170 
when so I was quite reluctant to change
over<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.799> emblem<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.370> why<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.579> dig<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:52.970> down

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
over to the emblem but why I dig up down

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.729 
over to the emblem but why I dig up down
was<00:03:53.390> mixing<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.870> end<00:03:54.079> blend<00:03:54.260> in<00:03:54.410> with<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.590> cold

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
was mixing the end blend in with a cold

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.350 
was mixing the end blend in with a cold
water<00:03:55.010> mix<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.489> never<00:03:55.670> really<00:03:55.970> looked<00:03:56.180> back

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
water mix and I never really looked back

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.660 
water mix and I never really looked back
since
