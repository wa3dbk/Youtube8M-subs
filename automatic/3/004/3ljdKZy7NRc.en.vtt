00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
now we're gonna turn this into a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
now we're gonna turn this into a
teardrop<00:01:31.920> by<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> pressing<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
teardrop by just kind of pressing on the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
teardrop by just kind of pressing on the
edge<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.260> how<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.860> turns

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
edge there and see how that just turns

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
edge there and see how that just turns
right<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> teardrop<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.360> flatten

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
right into a teardrop and then flatten

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.890 
right into a teardrop and then flatten
it<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.260> your<00:01:37.470> fingers<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:39.090> you're

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it with your fingers because you're

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.930 
it with your fingers because you're
putting<00:01:40.200> fingerprints<00:01:40.830> all<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> clay

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
putting fingerprints all over the clay

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.149 
putting fingerprints all over the clay
this<00:01:42.750> clay<00:01:42.990> will<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.260> very<00:01:43.500> natural<00:01:44.010> look

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
this clay will have a very natural look

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.440 
this clay will have a very natural look
so<00:01:44.190> don't<00:01:44.520> even<00:01:44.610> worry<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.299> try

to get all shiny and smooth use the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.910 
to get all shiny and smooth use the
fingerprints<00:01:47.250> -<00:01:47.370> perfect<00:01:47.820> okay<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.320> add<00:01:49.500> an

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
fingerprints - perfect okay so to add an

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.200 
fingerprints - perfect okay so to add an
impression<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.580> here<00:01:50.790> we're<00:01:50.880> gonna<00:01:50.970> use<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
impression on here we're gonna use a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280 
impression on here we're gonna use a
stamp<00:01:51.420> sheet<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:51.870> used<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.140> one

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
stamp sheet now I've used this one

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.780 
stamp sheet now I've used this one
already<00:01:52.470> before<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
already before so you can see that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
already before so you can see that
there's<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.000> lot<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.180> shininess<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.350> here

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
there's a lot of shininess on here

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.680 
there's a lot of shininess on here
that's<00:01:55.770> where<00:01:55.979> I've<00:01:56.070> used<00:01:56.369> mica<00:01:57.030> powder<00:01:57.390> as

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
that's where I've used mica powder as

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.800 
that's where I've used mica powder as
they<00:01:58.409> resist<00:01:58.890> resist<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.119> something<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.720> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
they resist resist is something that you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420 
they resist resist is something that you
have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> put<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.890> stamp<00:02:02.220> because

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
have to put on top of a stamp because

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
have to put on top of a stamp because
stamps<00:02:02.940> made<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.330> rubber<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stamps made out of rubber and if I just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.140 
stamps made out of rubber and if I just
press<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.979> clay<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.400> it<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
press the clay on it it's gonna want to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.969 
press the clay on it it's gonna want to
kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> grab<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> leave<00:02:07.080> little<00:02:07.560> bits<00:02:07.710> of

kind of grab and leave little bits of
the<00:02:08.099> clay<00:02:08.280> behind<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.269> will<00:02:09.420> make<00:02:09.539> your

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
the clay behind which will make your

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.869 
the clay behind which will make your
design<00:02:09.959> not<00:02:10.170> look<00:02:10.409> as<00:02:10.590> pretty<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.459> use<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
design not look as pretty so you use a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.759 
design not look as pretty so you use a
resist<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.689> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> resists<00:02:13.409> is<00:02:13.530> mica

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
resist and one of the resists is mica

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.949 
resist and one of the resists is mica
powder<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.849> also<00:02:15.000> happens<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.629> leave<00:02:15.930> a

that<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.500> bottom<00:03:13.709> wing<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.720> connected<00:03:15.720> before

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
that the bottom wing is connected before

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.020 
that the bottom wing is connected before
I<00:03:16.019> even<00:03:16.230> get<00:03:16.439> started<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.189> top<00:03:17.400> wing

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
I even get started to the top wing

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.460 
I even get started to the top wing
because<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.599> makes<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.169> little<00:03:19.260> bit

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
because that makes it just a little bit

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.199

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
insert it into the clay and then it will

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.659 
insert it into the clay and then it will
glue<00:06:27.630> itself<00:06:27.780> in<00:06:28.199> right<00:06:28.440> now<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.009> it'll<00:06:29.280> stay

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669

most<00:06:31.139> glues<00:06:31.560> don't<00:06:31.860> like<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.130> heat<00:06:32.340> they

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
most glues don't like the heat they

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.830 
most glues don't like the heat they
become<00:06:32.759> brittle<00:06:33.000> in<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.120> heat<00:06:33.270> but<00:06:33.419> this<00:06:33.599> one

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
become brittle in the heat but this one

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.350 
become brittle in the heat but this one
likes<00:06:34.590> it<00:06:34.800> so<00:06:34.979> you<00:06:35.039> can<00:06:35.250> use<00:06:35.370> it<00:06:35.490> for<00:06:35.580> that<00:06:35.699> all

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
likes it so you can use it for that all

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
holes so that we can hang it up later
