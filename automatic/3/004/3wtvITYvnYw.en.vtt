pan I take the hot olive oil and base
the<00:02:00.250> eggs<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:01.930> were<00:02:01.990> kind<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.320> bubbly<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
the eggs so they were kind of bubbly and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.530 
the eggs so they were kind of bubbly and
fried<00:02:03.130> up<00:02:03.310> top<00:02:03.550> still<00:02:03.970> soft<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.510> middle

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
fried up top still soft in the middle

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.410 
fried up top still soft in the middle
and<00:02:05.340> fry<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.370> around<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.790> edges<00:02:06.940> kind<00:02:07.330> of
