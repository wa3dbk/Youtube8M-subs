teardrop and I'm just gonna try and

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.060 
teardrop and I'm just gonna try and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
compare it to my other one to try and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.360 
compare it to my other one to try and
get<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.370> as<00:00:57.519> much<00:00:58.449> alike<00:00:58.780> as<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:59.140> can<00:00:59.500> of<00:01:00.070> course

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
get it as much alike as I can of course

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.580 
get it as much alike as I can of course
every<00:01:00.969> time<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.329> do<00:01:01.510> this<00:01:01.660> it's<00:01:01.899> gonna<00:01:02.019> turn

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
every time you do this it's gonna turn

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.020 
every time you do this it's gonna turn
out<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.769> little<00:01:03.070> bit<00:01:03.250> different<00:01:03.640> but<00:01:03.820> that's

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
out a little bit different but that's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
out a little bit different but that's
fine<00:01:04.330> because<00:01:04.600> peacock<00:01:05.320> feathers<00:01:05.770> are<00:01:06.070> all

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
fine because peacock feathers are all

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.930 
fine because peacock feathers are all
unique<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.320> course<00:01:08.620> anything<00:01:09.220> handmade<00:01:09.760> is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
unique so of course anything handmade is

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.330 
unique so of course anything handmade is
gonna<00:01:10.150> be<00:01:10.299> unique<00:01:10.659> as<00:01:10.900> well

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
gonna be unique as well

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.910 
gonna be unique as well
and<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.729> what<00:01:16.299> I'm<00:01:16.420> gonna<00:01:16.509> do<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.049> just<00:01:17.380> take

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and now what I'm gonna do is just take

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.969 
and now what I'm gonna do is just take
this<00:01:18.460> clay<00:01:18.820> tool<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.299> have<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.799> looks

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
this clay tool that I have and it looks

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.100 
this clay tool that I have and it looks
like<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.250> has<00:01:21.430> two<00:01:21.790> needles<00:01:22.210> or<00:01:22.390> two<00:01:22.570> pins<00:01:22.810> at

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
like it has two needles or two pins at

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
like it has two needles or two pins at
the<00:01:23.140> ends<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.619> if<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.310> don't<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.549> this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
the ends of it if you don't have this

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.420 
the ends of it if you don't have this
you<00:01:25.090> could<00:01:25.240> just<00:01:25.420> use<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.659> needle<00:01:25.930> or<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.259> pin<00:01:26.530> so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
you could just use a needle or a pin so

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.090 
you could just use a needle or a pin so
you<00:01:27.729> really<00:01:28.270> don't<00:01:28.450> need<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.409> same<00:01:29.590> tools<00:01:29.890> as

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
you really don't need the same tools as

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.010 
you really don't need the same tools as
I<00:01:30.220> do<00:01:30.280> now<00:01:31.270> what<00:01:31.420> I'm<00:01:31.509> going<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.659> do<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.900> I'm

know<00:01:34.540> where<00:01:34.930> we're<00:01:35.079> double<00:01:35.350> strike<00:01:35.740> from<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
know where we're double strike from so

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600 
know where we're double strike from so
taking<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.380> tool<00:01:38.770> I'm<00:01:39.009> just<00:01:39.070> gonna<00:01:39.310> start

taking that tool I'm just gonna start
from<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.820> line<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.450> then<00:01:40.540> drag<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.110> outwards

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
from the line and then drag it outwards

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.510 
from the line and then drag it outwards
and<00:01:42.299> every<00:01:43.299> time<00:01:43.540> we<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.960> stroke<00:01:44.530> we're

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520

if you have a needle or a pin I don't

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.020 
if you have a needle or a pin I don't
think<00:02:08.350> you'll<00:02:08.500> have<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:08.890> problem<00:02:09.340> though

think you'll have this problem though
another<00:02:11.750> way<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.850> manage<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.150> more

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
another way that you can manage it more

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.480 
another way that you can manage it more
is<00:02:14.660> once<00:02:15.350> you're<00:02:15.650> doing<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.190> could<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.460> it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
is once you're doing it you could do it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.490 
is once you're doing it you could do it
slowly<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.180> press<00:02:17.600> down<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> piece<00:02:18.470> of
