00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.520 
but I mean I think Apple needs to do
something<00:01:39.790> because<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:41.170> really<00:01:41.350> getting

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
something because it's really getting
killed<00:01:41.890> over<00:01:42.040> here<00:01:42.310> let's<00:01:42.580> try<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.880> again

also it's it's not as it's not as good
as<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> nose<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.320> on<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.590> s2<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> would<00:03:47.250> say

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
as on the nose and on the s2 I would say

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.250 
as on the nose and on the s2 I would say
but<00:03:47.460> you<00:03:47.610> know<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.180> still<00:03:48.570> pretty<00:03:48.840> good<00:03:49.080> off
