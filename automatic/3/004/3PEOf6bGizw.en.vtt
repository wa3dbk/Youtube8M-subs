video in favor of this one because I'm

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.430 
video in favor of this one because I'm
actually<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> show<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.990> how<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.139> play

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
actually going to show you how to play

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.709 
actually going to show you how to play
it<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.800> don't<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> overlooked<00:00:12.570> this

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
it I don't know how I overlooked this

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
it I don't know how I overlooked this
but<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.170> back<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.559> reviewing<00:00:13.889> my<00:00:14.099> videos<00:00:14.460> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
but going back and reviewing my videos I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
but going back and reviewing my videos I
saw<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.049> something

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
saw that there was something

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.220 
saw that there was something
fundamentally<00:00:16.850> lacking<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
fundamentally lacking in this one so I

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.990 
fundamentally lacking in this one so I
play<00:00:19.500> each<00:00:19.710> phrase<00:00:19.740> slowly<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.730> we're<00:00:20.880> going

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
play each phrase slowly then we're going

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
play each phrase slowly then we're going
to<00:00:21.029> tear<00:00:21.240> them<00:00:21.359> apart<00:00:21.420> here's<00:00:21.900> phrase<00:00:22.199> 1

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:57.230 

again

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:18.890 

okay<00:00:58.320> here's<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.410> first<00:00:59.500> one<00:00:59.860> extremely<00:01:00.520> slow

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.600 

ah

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.820 

all<00:01:28.270> right<00:01:28.480> let's<00:01:28.990> go<00:01:29.110> up<00:01:29.230> to<00:01:29.320> string<00:01:29.560> number

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
all right let's go up to string number

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.310 
all right let's go up to string number
three<00:01:30.100> fret<00:01:30.400> number<00:01:30.640> 17<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:32.050> this<00:01:32.170> would

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
three fret number 17 so this would

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.900 
three fret number 17 so this would
equate<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.710> fifth<00:01:32.950> fret<00:01:33.130> down<00:01:33.370> here<00:01:33.670> right

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
equate to the fifth fret down here right

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.630 
equate to the fifth fret down here right
plus<00:01:34.150> twelve<00:01:34.450> we<00:01:34.720> got<00:01:34.870> 17<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:36.130> have<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> B

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
plus twelve we got 17 we have the B

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.880 
plus twelve we got 17 we have the B
pedal<00:01:36.880> down<00:01:37.180> on<00:01:37.420> our<00:01:37.570> first<00:01:37.840> string<00:01:38.140> which

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
pedal down on our first string which

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.640 
pedal down on our first string which
gives<00:01:39.130> us<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.460> D<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.570> what<00:01:41.290> we're<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.530> be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
gives us a D and what we're going to be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.560 
gives us a D and what we're going to be
doing<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.980> striking<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.430> D<00:01:42.730> I'm<00:01:43.270> going<00:01:43.510> to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
doing is striking the D I'm going to

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.560 
doing is striking the D I'm going to
slide<00:01:43.840> up<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.230> f-sharp<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.270> an<00:01:46.360> E

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
slide up to the f-sharp this is an E

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.520 
slide up to the f-sharp this is an E
open<00:01:47.110> with<00:01:47.290> our<00:01:47.320> B<00:01:47.530> pedal<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:48.070> string<00:01:48.430> 5<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
open with our B pedal on string 5 and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.260 
open with our B pedal on string 5 and
this<00:01:50.620> gives<00:01:50.860> us<00:01:51.010> basically<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.430> root<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.210> a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
this gives us basically a root in a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.490 
this gives us basically a root in a
major<00:01:52.450> 3rd<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.960> D<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:55.840> going<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.050> strike<00:01:56.260> them

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
major 3rd in D I'm going to strike them

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.700 
major 3rd in D I'm going to strike them
separately<00:01:57.070> strike<00:01:57.400> three<00:01:58.200> strike<00:01:59.200> fat

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
separately strike three strike fat
