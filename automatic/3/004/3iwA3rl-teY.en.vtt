00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
training that's going to definitely put

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.379

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
on some serious mass so basically you

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.089 
on some serious mass so basically you
know<00:03:35.540> we<00:03:35.989> with<00:03:36.290> your<00:03:36.409> training<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.859> want<00:03:37.009> to

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
know we with your training you want to

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.409 
know we with your training you want to
be<00:03:37.189> effect<00:03:37.519> if<00:03:37.669> you<00:03:37.699> want<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.939> break<00:03:38.090> down<00:03:38.239> as

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
be effect if you want to break down as

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.659 
be effect if you want to break down as
much<00:03:38.599> muscle<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.139> can<00:03:39.379> and<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:40.400> little

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
much muscle as you can and as little

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.729 
much muscle as you can and as little
time<00:03:40.879> as<00:03:40.939> you<00:03:41.180> can<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:42.109> know<00:03:42.259> whether<00:03:42.530> it's

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
time as you can you know whether it's

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.559 
time as you can you know whether it's
training<00:03:42.979> heavy<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.909> know<00:03:44.030> really<00:03:44.209> working

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
training heavy you know really working

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.479 
training heavy you know really working
on<00:03:44.659> a<00:03:44.720> movement<00:03:45.259> the<00:03:45.349> eccentric<00:03:45.829> part<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
on a movement the eccentric part of the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.740 
on a movement the eccentric part of the
movement<00:03:46.729> so<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.060> can<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.359> break<00:03:47.599> the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
movement so you can really break the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.259 
movement so you can really break the
muscle<00:03:48.079> down<00:03:48.229> or<00:03:49.040> whether<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.519> just<00:03:49.699> you

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
muscle down or whether it's just you

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.749 
muscle down or whether it's just you
know<00:03:50.419> just<00:03:50.659> working<00:03:51.199> with<00:03:51.709> super<00:03:52.370> sets<00:03:52.609> of

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:52.759 
know just working with super sets of

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.949 
know just working with super sets of
giants<00:03:53.150> that's<00:03:53.299> when<00:03:53.479> you<00:03:53.569> get<00:03:53.689> a<00:03:53.750> lot<00:03:53.930> of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
giants that's when you get a lot of

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.379 
giants that's when you get a lot of
working<00:03:54.349> at<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> time<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:55.970> want<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.239> use

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
working at a time you just want to use

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.270 
working at a time you just want to use
those<00:03:56.720> methods<00:03:57.199> drop<00:03:57.470> sets<00:03:57.739> or<00:03:57.919> whatever<00:03:58.159> just

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
those methods drop sets or whatever just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.819
