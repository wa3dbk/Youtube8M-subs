00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
and then take that flap and flatten it

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:31.280 
and then take that flap and flatten it
back<00:04:18.160> over<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.750> flatten<00:04:19.750> everything<00:04:19.810> out

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.960 

all<00:04:32.290> right<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.710> then<00:04:33.010> fold<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.030> tip<00:04:35.550> down<00:04:36.550> to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
all right and then fold this tip down to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.540 
all right and then fold this tip down to
like<00:04:37.810> you'll<00:04:37.960> see<00:04:38.139> corner<00:04:38.950> there<00:04:39.130> in<00:04:39.280> corner

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
like you'll see corner there in corner

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.060 
like you'll see corner there in corner
there<00:04:39.750> right<00:04:40.750> there's<00:04:41.110> like<00:04:41.290> there<00:04:41.860> won't<00:04:42.010> be

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
there right there's like there won't be

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.560 
there right there's like there won't be
a<00:04:42.130> line<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.639> there's<00:04:43.060> like<00:04:43.240> an<00:04:43.360> imaginary

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
a line but there's like an imaginary

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.690 
a line but there's like an imaginary
line<00:04:43.900> between<00:04:44.229> those<00:04:44.560> two<00:04:44.770> points<00:04:45.240> fold<00:04:46.240> this

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
line between those two points fold this

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:57.000 
line between those two points fold this
top<00:04:48.960> down<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:53.460> imaginary<00:04:54.460> line<00:04:56.010> make

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
top down to that imaginary line make

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.150 
top down to that imaginary line make
sure<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.490> keep<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.850> straight

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
sure to keep it straight

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.600 
sure to keep it straight
flatten<00:05:00.160> out<00:05:00.250> all<00:05:00.520> your<00:05:00.790> folds<00:05:02.460> widen<00:05:03.460> them

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
flatten out all your folds widen them

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.420 
flatten out all your folds widen them
all<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.300> them<00:05:04.479> out<00:05:04.600> just<00:05:04.810> just<00:05:05.130> do<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.930> then

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
all of them out just just do it and then

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.230 
all of them out just just do it and then
right<00:05:09.430> at<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:10.270> right<00:05:11.050> here

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
right at this right here

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:23.170 
right at this right here
don't<00:05:13.240> line<00:05:13.440> fold<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.650> tip<00:05:14.860> back<00:05:15.160> up

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:33.490 

and<00:05:24.180> then<00:05:25.220> it'll<00:05:26.220> look<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:26.430> that<00:05:28.340> hold<00:05:29.340> back

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.159 

all<00:05:34.500> right<00:05:34.590> now<00:05:35.009> I'm<00:05:35.159> gonna<00:05:35.840> flatten<00:05:36.840> out<00:05:37.020> all

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
all right now I'm gonna flatten out all

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:46.760 
all right now I'm gonna flatten out all
the<00:05:37.259> folds<00:05:37.560> again<00:05:44.449> just<00:05:45.449> takes<00:05:45.720> a<00:05:45.930> little<00:05:46.560> bit

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
the folds again just takes a little bit

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.710 
the folds again just takes a little bit
of<00:05:46.830> hard<00:05:47.190> work<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.729> little<00:05:48.180> bit<00:05:48.449> of<00:05:48.569> elbow

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
of hard work a little bit of elbow

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:58.719 
of hard work a little bit of elbow
grease<00:05:50.389> all<00:05:51.389> right<00:05:51.539> and<00:05:55.639> the<00:05:56.639> wing<00:05:56.879> crease

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
grease all right and the wing crease

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.580 
grease all right and the wing crease
looks<00:05:59.729> like<00:05:59.969> that<00:06:00.199> there's<00:06:01.199> no<00:06:01.379> real

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
looks like that there's no real

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.939 
looks like that there's no real
measurement<00:06:02.430> for<00:06:02.669> it<00:06:02.849> but<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.680> right<00:06:04.680> about

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
measurement for it but just right about

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.240 
measurement for it but just right about
there<00:06:05.219> about<00:06:05.969> that<00:06:06.180> big<00:06:06.740> -<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:07.770> big<00:06:08.159> angle<00:06:08.819> up

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
there about that big - that big angle up

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.230 
there about that big - that big angle up
submitted<00:06:11.250> there<00:06:11.370> that<00:06:11.520> right<00:06:11.639> there<00:06:11.849> that

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
submitted there that right there that

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:21.320 
submitted there that right there that
big<00:06:12.270> about<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:18.530> and<00:06:19.530> then<00:06:19.909> copy<00:06:20.909> with<00:06:21.210> the

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
big about that and then copy with the

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.450 
big about that and then copy with the
other<00:06:21.449> side<00:06:22.520> align<00:06:23.629> the<00:06:24.629> top<00:06:24.990> up<00:06:25.319> with<00:06:25.830> you<00:06:26.219> the

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
other side align the top up with you the

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:35.330 
other side align the top up with you the
last<00:06:26.669> wing<00:06:31.460> there<00:06:32.460> there's<00:06:32.969> the<00:06:33.120> ninja<00:06:34.190> like<00:06:35.190> I

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
last wing there there's the ninja like I

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.180 
last wing there there's the ninja like I
said<00:06:35.520> in<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.669> beginning<00:06:35.789> that<00:06:36.919> wing<00:06:37.919> should

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
said in the beginning that wing should

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.129 
said in the beginning that wing should
be<00:06:38.279> like<00:06:38.520> a<00:06:38.849> little<00:06:39.090> bit<00:06:39.300> lower<00:06:39.659> than<00:06:39.810> this

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
be like a little bit lower than this

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:50.480 
be like a little bit lower than this
that<00:06:41.039> way<00:06:42.770> huh<00:06:45.949> look<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.069> same<00:06:49.250> this<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.310> a
