00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
been getting you know those are

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.950 
been getting you know those are
repetitive<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.210> I'm<00:00:26.330> sure<00:00:26.570> there<00:00:26.780> are<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:26.870> lot

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
repetitive so I'm sure there are a lot

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.660 
repetitive so I'm sure there are a lot
more<00:00:27.140> people<00:00:27.290> that<00:00:27.590> would<00:00:28.190> benefit<00:00:28.610> from

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
more people that would benefit from

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.870 
more people that would benefit from
answers<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.360> answer<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.870> those<00:00:30.190> so<00:00:31.190> first

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
answers to answer to those so first

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.450 
answers to answer to those so first
question<00:00:32.390> was<00:00:32.689> what<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.560> best<00:00:33.800> graphic

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
question was what is the best graphic

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.790 
question was what is the best graphic
card<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:35.180> support<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.660> three<00:00:35.900> monitor<00:00:36.320> half

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
card to support the three monitor half

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.970 
card to support the three monitor half
of<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.070> set<00:00:37.310> up<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.170> we<00:00:39.170> used<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.410> hesitate<00:00:39.860> to

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
of a set up and we used to hesitate to

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.860 
of a set up and we used to hesitate to
give<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.190> answer<00:00:40.579> because<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.090> not<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:41.810> the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
give the answer because we're not in the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.479 
give the answer because we're not in the
business<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.290> making<00:00:42.410> graphics<00:00:42.950> cards<00:00:43.280> but

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
business of making graphics cards but

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.800 
business of making graphics cards but
due<00:00:44.150> to<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.680> experimentation<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.790> you<00:00:47.690> know

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
due to the experimentation and you know

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.710 
due to the experimentation and you know
us<00:00:48.130> using<00:00:49.130> several<00:00:49.489> different<00:00:50.000> cards<00:00:50.329> from

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
us using several different cards from

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.130 
us using several different cards from
different<00:00:51.110> brands<00:00:51.739> we<00:00:52.280> can<00:00:52.489> probably<00:00:52.989> give<00:00:53.989> a

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
different brands we can probably give a

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.530 
different brands we can probably give a
recommendation<00:00:54.290> of<00:00:55.070> at<00:00:55.309> least<00:00:55.640> two<00:00:56.000> gigabyte

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
recommendation of at least two gigabyte

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.680 
recommendation of at least two gigabyte
memory<00:00:57.079> card<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:58.309> support<00:00:58.700> three<00:00:59.000> 27-inch

memory card to support three 27-inch
monitors<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.469> reason<00:01:00.739> for<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.130> as

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
monitors and the reason for that is as

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.100 
monitors and the reason for that is as
you<00:01:01.760> can<00:01:01.880> imagine<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.420> need<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.630> lot<00:01:02.840> more

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
you can imagine you need a lot more

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.360 
you can imagine you need a lot more
video<00:01:04.040> memory<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:05.150> display<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.159> graphics<00:01:07.159> on

video memory to display the graphics on
three<00:01:07.580> monitors<00:01:07.850> versus<00:01:08.330> one<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:08.840> 1<00:01:09.049> gigabyte

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
three monitors versus one so 1 gigabyte

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.140 
three monitors versus one so 1 gigabyte
didn't<00:01:09.740> seem<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> be<00:01:10.130> enough<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.850> we<00:01:10.970> used<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
didn't seem to be enough and we used to

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.570 
didn't seem to be enough and we used to
get<00:01:11.409> lower<00:01:12.409> frame<00:01:12.770> rates<00:01:12.979> especially<00:01:13.220> if

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
get lower frame rates especially if

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.250 
get lower frame rates especially if
you're<00:01:13.670> using<00:01:13.820> add-on<00:01:14.240> scenery<00:01:14.690> like<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.049> see

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're using add-on scenery like you see

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.530 
you're using add-on scenery like you see
here<00:01:15.590> we're<00:01:16.070> sitting<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.700> runway<00:01:16.850> 6<00:01:17.299> right

it's<00:01:21.590> an<00:01:21.740> airport<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.190> we<00:01:22.250> fly<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.790> real

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
it's an airport and we fly to in real

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.080 
it's an airport and we fly to in real
life<00:01:23.180> occasionally<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:25.430> got<00:01:25.610> an<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.940> on

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
downtown area in Cleveland so we wanted

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.050 
downtown area in Cleveland so we wanted

we've put in this computer we're getting

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.250 
we've put in this computer we're getting
at<00:01:37.670> least<00:01:37.700> 30<00:01:38.150> frames<00:01:38.420> per<00:01:38.540> second<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.140> that's

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
at least 30 frames per second and that's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.380 
at least 30 frames per second and that's
seems<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.189> be<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.430> benchmark<00:01:40.880> for<00:01:40.939> fluid

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
seems to be the benchmark for fluid

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.539 
seems to be the benchmark for fluid
friend-friend<00:01:42.200> rates<00:01:42.619> obviously<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.369> more

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
friend-friend rates obviously the more

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.240 
friend-friend rates obviously the more
the<00:01:43.729> better<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.180> at<00:01:44.810> least<00:01:44.990> 30<00:01:45.740> frames<00:01:46.159> per

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the better but at least 30 frames per

the better but at least 30 frames per
second<00:01:46.700> seems<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.939> be<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.240> sweet<00:01:47.450> spot<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
second seems to be the sweet spot the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.630 
second seems to be the sweet spot the
second<00:01:48.920> thing<00:01:49.070> we<00:01:49.189> want<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.400> talk<00:01:49.490> about

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
second thing we want to talk about

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760 
second thing we want to talk about
really<00:01:49.939> briefly<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.509> our<00:01:50.659> Center<00:01:51.080> stickman

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
really briefly is our Center stickman

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.490 
really briefly is our Center stickman
so<00:01:51.920> center<00:01:52.790> stick<00:01:53.000> mount<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.330> an<00:01:53.420> accessory

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
so center stick mount is an accessory

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.730 
so center stick mount is an accessory
and<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:55.220> our<00:01:55.250> sim<00:01:55.730> in<00:01:55.940> November<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.170> standard

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and to our sim in November it's standard

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.530 
and to our sim in November it's standard
with<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.370> Sims<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.030> all<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> does

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
with all of the Sims and it all it does

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.510 
with all of the Sims and it all it does
just<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.680> name<00:02:00.770> suggests<00:02:00.980> allows<00:02:01.280> you

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
just like the name suggests allows you

Microsoft joystick here and I've got a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.410 
Microsoft joystick here and I've got a
old<00:02:30.140> but<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:30.580> force<00:02:31.580> feedback<00:02:31.880> too<00:02:32.209> from

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
old but good force feedback too from

Microsoft that no longer made this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.080 
Microsoft that no longer made this
joystick<00:02:35.480> probably<00:02:35.780> 15<00:02:36.110> years<00:02:36.320> old<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.340> still

joystick probably 15 years old and still

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.170 
joystick probably 15 years old and still
runs<00:02:38.390> great<00:02:39.400> reason<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:40.970> much<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
runs great reason I like it so much is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.530 
runs great reason I like it so much is
because<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:42.110> has<00:02:42.350> force<00:02:42.590> feedback<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:44.390> my

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
because it has force feedback and in my

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.870 
because it has force feedback and in my
opinion<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.900> adds<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.560> great<00:02:46.340> deal<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
opinion that adds a great deal to the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.650 
opinion that adds a great deal to the
sense<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.270> immersion<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.080> realism<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:49.660> that's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
sense of immersion and realism so that's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.930 
sense of immersion and realism so that's
something<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.290> maybe<00:02:51.860> if<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.310> happen<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
something that maybe if you happen to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.690 
something that maybe if you happen to
come<00:02:53.390> across<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.870> from<00:02:54.170> eBay<00:02:54.800> or<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> used<00:02:55.459> one

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
come across one from eBay or a used one

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.180 
come across one from eBay or a used one
I<00:02:55.940> would<00:02:56.270> recommend<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.980> get

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
I would recommend that you that you get

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.310 
I would recommend that you that you get
one<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.580> don't<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.910> one<00:02:59.060> already<00:02:59.320> if

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
one if you don't have one already if

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.750 
one if you don't have one already if
you're<00:03:00.680> using<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.070> kind<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.340> joystick<00:03:01.519> you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
you're using this kind of joystick you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.180 
you're using this kind of joystick you
can<00:03:01.910> also<00:03:02.060> use<00:03:02.360> your<00:03:02.540> throttle<00:03:03.260> panel<00:03:03.680> or

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
can also use your throttle panel or

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.740 
can also use your throttle panel or
throttle<00:03:04.760> quadrant<00:03:04.850> on<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.300> right<00:03:05.480> hand<00:03:05.690> side

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
throttle quadrant on the right hand side

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.660 
throttle quadrant on the right hand side
from<00:03:06.080> SciTech<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:07.160> can<00:03:07.310> still<00:03:07.519> have<00:03:07.550> your

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
from SciTech so you can still have your

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.870 
from SciTech so you can still have your
yoke<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:09.170> can<00:03:09.290> still<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.680> your<00:03:09.880> throw

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
yoke you can still have your throw

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.590 
yoke you can still have your throw
quadrant<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.930> all<00:03:12.170> works

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
quadrant and it all works

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.490 
quadrant and it all works
interchangeably<00:03:14.600> if<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> will<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.320> can

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
interchangeably if you will so you can

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.620 
interchangeably if you will so you can
have<00:03:15.650> both<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.890> those<00:03:16.160> set<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.300> we<00:03:17.420> talked

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
have both of those set up so we talked

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.900 
have both of those set up so we talked
about<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.230> center<00:03:18.560> mount<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:19.730> fully

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
about the center mount it's fully

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.990 
about the center mount it's fully
adjustable<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.780> down<00:03:20.900> forward<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.739> aft

adjustable up and down forward and aft

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.550 
adjustable up and down forward and aft
let's<00:03:23.000> get<00:03:23.120> out<00:03:23.209> maybe<00:03:23.660> show<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.170> all<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
let's get out maybe show all the all the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.630 
let's get out maybe show all the all the
mounting<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.160> imagine<00:03:25.489> your

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
mounting but you can imagine your

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.490 
mounting but you can imagine your
display<00:03:25.970> guys<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.269> can<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.600> slides<00:03:26.870> forward

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
display guys you can see slides forward

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.460 
display guys you can see slides forward
and<00:03:27.739> back<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.340> up<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.970> down<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.930> get

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
and back and up and down and you can get

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.960 
and back and up and down and you can get
it<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.709> place<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:31.280> cinch<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.700> if<00:03:31.850> you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
it to place and then cinch it if you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.479 
it to place and then cinch it if you
don't<00:03:32.360> need<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.660> can<00:03:32.750> remove<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.230> always

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
don't need it you can remove it always

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.940 
don't need it you can remove it always
and<00:03:34.489> then<00:03:34.910> put<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.150> aside<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.560> kind<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.830> a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
and then put it aside and that kind of a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.860 
and then put it aside and that kind of a
thing<00:03:37.160> again<00:03:37.730> rudder<00:03:38.000> panels<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.540> still

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
thing again rudder panels you can still

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.930 
thing again rudder panels you can still
use<00:03:39.370> even<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.640> have<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.360> joystick<00:03:41.900> with<00:03:42.350> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
use even if you have the joystick with a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.940 
use even if you have the joystick with a
rudder<00:03:43.940> axis<00:03:44.150> because<00:03:44.989> what<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.230> can<00:03:45.380> do<00:03:45.470> I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
rudder axis because what you can do I

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.280 
rudder axis because what you can do I
did<00:03:46.190> here<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.820> repro

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
did here is you can repro

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.830 
did here is you can repro
that<00:03:47.439> router<00:03:47.620> X's<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.610> can<00:03:48.730> look<00:03:48.909> left<00:03:49.569> and

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
that router X's so you can look left and

that router X's so you can look left and
right<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.200> think<00:03:50.260> that's<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.680> really<00:03:51.040> good

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
right I think that's a really good

right I think that's a really good
feature<00:03:51.730> because<00:03:52.180> which<00:03:52.420> essentially<00:03:52.780> you

feature because which essentially you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.610 
feature because which essentially you
can<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.459> know<00:03:54.719> when<00:03:55.719> I<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.959> show<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.290> if

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
can do is you know when I to show you if

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.199 
can do is you know when I to show you if
you're<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.340> instance<00:03:57.430> flying<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.060> you're<00:03:58.150> on

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
you're for instance flying and you're on

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.490 
you're for instance flying and you're on
the<00:03:58.299> downwind<00:03:58.719> you<00:03:58.810> want<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.019> see<00:03:59.170> where<00:03:59.379> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
the downwind you want to see where you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.990 
the downwind you want to see where you
are<00:03:59.530> with<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.829> respect<00:04:00.159> to<00:04:00.219> the<00:04:00.340> runway<00:04:00.670> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
are with the respect to the runway you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.300 
are with the respect to the runway you
can<00:04:01.030> use<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:01.840> we're<00:04:02.439> going<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.769> take<00:04:03.069> off

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
can use that so we're going to take off

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.860 
can use that so we're going to take off
here<00:04:03.670> I'm<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.239> make<00:04:04.359> sure<00:04:04.390> I've<00:04:04.599> got<00:04:04.750> my

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.660 
landing light on strobe nav Wow don't
need<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.500> nav<00:04:08.680> lights<00:04:08.920> but<00:04:09.099> we<00:04:09.129> got<00:04:09.340> strobes

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
need the nav lights but we got strobes

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.270 
need the nav lights but we got strobes

on and beacon on and landing lights on
we<00:04:13.239> got<00:04:13.389> a<00:04:13.420> gear<00:04:13.629> down<00:04:13.810> let's<00:04:14.439> see<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.920> natural

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
we got a gear down let's see one natural

dynamic<00:04:25.169> let's<00:04:26.169> see<00:04:26.320> what<00:04:26.470> else<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.110> would

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
dynamic let's see what else what I would

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.510 
dynamic let's see what else what I would
just<00:04:29.590> make<00:04:29.740> sure<00:04:29.770> there's<00:04:30.039> nobody<00:04:30.190> on<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
just make sure there's nobody on the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.100 
just make sure there's nobody on the
final<00:04:30.789> here<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.090> let's<00:04:31.210> take<00:04:31.389> off<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.050> I'll

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
final here and let's take off and I'll

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.380 
final here and let's take off and I'll
show<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.520> how<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.699> whole<00:04:33.880> setup<00:04:34.150> works

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.600 

so<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:40.480> can<00:04:40.690> use<00:04:40.840> either<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.230> SciTech<00:04:41.620> when<00:04:42.490> is

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
so you can use either to SciTech when is

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.820 
so you can use either to SciTech when is
a<00:04:42.730> psychic<00:04:43.030> throttle<00:04:43.450> you<00:04:44.260> can<00:04:44.440> use<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> one

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
a psychic throttle you can use the one

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.890 
a psychic throttle you can use the one
on<00:04:44.980> your<00:04:45.130> joystick<00:04:45.520> again<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.390> can<00:04:46.570> use<00:04:46.690> them

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
on your joystick again you can use them

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.260 
on your joystick again you can use them
together

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
seems to be still students would be

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.520 
seems to be still students would be
doing<00:05:42.580> very<00:05:42.790> well<00:05:42.990> as<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.110> can<00:05:44.260> see<00:05:44.440> the

this<00:05:48.580> very<00:05:48.850> busy<00:05:49.090> environment<00:05:49.510> here<00:05:50.400> at<00:05:51.400> least

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
this very busy environment here at least

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.050 
this very busy environment here at least
30<00:05:52.090> frames<00:05:52.420> per<00:05:52.540> second

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.760 

and<00:05:57.510> we're<00:05:57.780> still<00:05:57.960> using<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.320> psychic

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
and we're still using the psychic

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.909 
and we're still using the psychic
pleasant<00:05:59.340> flight<00:05:59.790> instrument<00:06:00.300> house

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.679 

so<00:06:03.460> I'm<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:03.669> going<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:03.879> do<00:06:03.999> a<00:06:04.060> quick<00:06:04.270> quick

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:04.689 
so I'm just going to do a quick quick

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.110 
so I'm just going to do a quick quick
hop<00:06:05.289> around<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.710> pattern<00:06:06.039> the<00:06:06.699> other<00:06:06.849> thing<00:06:07.060> I

how to fly an airplane in this videos as
you<00:07:14.710> can<00:07:14.830> see<00:07:14.980> there's<00:07:15.160> a<00:07:15.250> lot<00:07:15.370> pretty

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
as you can see the frame rates are still

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.700 
as you can see the frame rates are still
very<00:07:21.430> good<00:07:21.730> we<00:07:22.360> have<00:07:22.390> it<00:07:22.540> set<00:07:22.870> on<00:07:22.900> unlimited

very good we have it set on unlimited
frame<00:07:23.920> rates<00:07:24.160> and<00:07:24.430> again<00:07:25.090> it's<00:07:25.750> and<00:07:26.140> the

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
frame rates and again it's and the

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.530 
frame rates and again it's and the
details<00:07:26.920> and<00:07:27.130> everything<00:07:27.220> on<00:07:28.030> a<00:07:28.090> very<00:07:28.360> high

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
settings and as you can see we're still

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.820 
settings and as you can see we're still
getting<00:07:30.910> a<00:07:31.180> pretty<00:07:31.540> good<00:07:31.660> pretty<00:07:32.440> good<00:07:32.560> frame

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
getting a pretty good pretty good frame

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.530 
getting a pretty good pretty good frame
rates<00:07:33.070> then<00:07:33.190> again<00:07:33.460> we're<00:07:33.970> not<00:07:34.000> doing<00:07:34.330> all<00:07:34.420> the

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540 
rates then again we're not doing all the

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.030 
rates then again we're not doing all the
checklists<00:07:34.930> and<00:07:35.140> flying<00:07:35.410> by<00:07:35.650> the<00:07:35.710> book<00:07:35.890> I'm

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.040 
checklists and flying by the book I'm

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.620 
checklists and flying by the book I'm
kind<00:07:36.250> of<00:07:36.310> flying<00:07:36.490> actually<00:07:37.030> pretty<00:07:37.210> sloppily

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
kind of flying actually pretty sloppily

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.320 
kind of flying actually pretty sloppily
here<00:07:37.900> but<00:07:38.740> I<00:07:38.950> just<00:07:39.130> wanted<00:07:39.400> to<00:07:39.460> demonstrate<00:07:39.670> to

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
here but I just wanted to demonstrate to

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.400 
here but I just wanted to demonstrate to
you

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410 
you

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.840 
you
you<00:07:41.710> know<00:07:41.830> how<00:07:41.920> the<00:07:41.980> sim<00:07:42.310> looks<00:07:42.550> from<00:07:42.760> the

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850 
you know how the sim looks from the

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.090 
you know how the sim looks from the
pilot<00:07:43.270> view<00:07:43.690> I<00:07:43.720> guess<00:07:44.020> because<00:07:44.230> a<00:07:44.620> lot<00:07:44.890> of<00:07:44.920> our

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.100 
pilot view I guess because a lot of our

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.500 
pilot view I guess because a lot of our
videos<00:07:45.310> who<00:07:45.610> are<00:07:45.700> looking<00:07:45.910> at<00:07:46.030> the<00:07:46.120> hard<00:07:46.300> work

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510 
videos who are looking at the hard work

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.290 
videos who are looking at the hard work
not<00:07:47.140> necessarily<00:07:47.290> yet

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300 
not necessarily yet

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.990 
not necessarily yet
just<00:07:49.750> showing<00:07:50.139> you<00:07:50.229> how<00:07:50.409> the<00:07:50.470> sim<00:07:50.800> looks<00:07:51.400> on

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 
just showing you how the sim looks on

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.149 
just showing you how the sim looks on
the<00:07:52.150> monitor<00:07:52.539> so<00:07:52.750> hopefully<00:07:53.080> that<00:07:53.229> was<00:07:53.440> that
