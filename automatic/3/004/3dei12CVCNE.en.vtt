00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.580 
I think that if DW can learn how to ride
a<00:06:53.789> bike<00:06:54.090> I<00:06:54.419> think<00:06:54.720> she<00:06:55.020> can<00:06:55.199> learn<00:06:55.380> how<00:06:55.560> to

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.789 
a bike I think she can learn how to
skate<00:06:55.979> and<00:06:56.009> have<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.280> lot<00:06:56.490> of<00:06:56.610> fun
