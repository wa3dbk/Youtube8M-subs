00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
heard that Bethesda Game Studios focuses

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
heard that Bethesda Game Studios focuses
on<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:42.060> game<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> time<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.049> steel<00:01:43.290> size<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
on one game at a time the steel size is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
on one game at a time the steel size is
about<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> same<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> has<00:01:44.640> been<00:01:44.790> for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
about the same that it has been for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.550 
about the same that it has been for
years<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> hundred<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.170> something

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
years which is a hundred or something

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
years which is a hundred or something
it's<00:01:46.770> roughly<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> same<00:01:47.579> size<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> team

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's roughly the same size as the team

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's roughly the same size as the team
that<00:01:48.509> ships<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:49.020> him<00:01:49.140> yes<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.590> says<00:01:49.740> de<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that ships got him yes but says de is a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.380 
that ships got him yes but says de is a
very<00:01:50.280> concise<00:01:50.610> team<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> people

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
very concise team and a lot of people

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.929 
very concise team and a lot of people
wondered<00:01:51.869> why<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.680> pump<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.729> many

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
wondered why they don't pump out so many

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
wondered why they don't pump out so many
games<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.229> they're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
games and this is why is because they're

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
games and this is why is because they're
a<00:01:55.439> small<00:01:55.740> team<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.520> don't<00:01:56.610> want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> get

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a small team and they don't want to get

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
a small team and they don't want to get
locked<00:01:57.149> into<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> okay<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.200> gotta<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> a

alternate<00:02:01.829> cycle<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.610> being<00:02:02.850> forced<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> make

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
alternate cycle of being forced to make

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
alternate cycle of being forced to make
games<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.380> people<00:02:04.530> want<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.189> making

the games that they want and that's why

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.540 
the games that they want and that's why
their<00:02:07.500> games<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.920> special<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.369> because

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
their games are so special is because

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.080 
their games are so special is because
Bethesda<00:02:09.270> talks<00:02:09.899> about<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:11.150> makes<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.540> they

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
Bethesda talks about or makes what they

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.720 
Bethesda talks about or makes what they
and<00:02:13.450> we're<00:02:14.230> very<00:02:14.260> lucky<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.860> they<00:02:15.160> make<00:02:15.459> what

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and we're very lucky that they make what

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.580 
and we're very lucky that they make what
we<00:02:15.910> want<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.390> well<00:02:16.420> because<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.470> would

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
we want as well because that would

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.170 
we want as well because that would
obviously<00:02:17.739> be<00:02:18.040> an<00:02:18.310> unfortunate<00:02:19.090> coincidence

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
of 2013 and ended up being a little bit

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.030 
of 2013 and ended up being a little bit
more<00:03:12.579> until<00:03:12.940> fallout<00:03:13.450> 4<00:03:13.720> was<00:03:13.900> revealed<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.410> so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
more until fallout 4 was revealed and so

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
more until fallout 4 was revealed and so

um you know with that said I feel like

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.890 
um you know with that said I feel like
you<00:03:17.319> know<00:03:17.440> they<00:03:18.040> would<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.090> release<00:03:19.329> DLC

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
you know they would have to release DLC

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.500 
you know they would have to release DLC
and<00:03:20.109> mod<00:03:20.440> support<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:21.040> fall<00:03:21.250> four<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.940> then

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and mod support for fall four and then

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.360 
and mod support for fall four and then
they<00:03:22.660> have<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.930> bug<00:03:23.170> stomp<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.769> then<00:03:24.160> they

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
they have to bug stomp and then they

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
they have to bug stomp and then they
could<00:03:24.579> properly<00:03:25.000> move<00:03:25.269> on<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.630> next

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
could properly move on to the next

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.289 
could properly move on to the next
project<00:03:25.989> fully<00:03:26.709> once<00:03:27.310> everything's<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.269> to

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
project fully once everything's good to

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.660 
project fully once everything's good to
go<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.560> speculation<00:03:30.280> could<00:03:30.430> kind

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
go and then the speculation could kind

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.039 
go and then the speculation could kind
of<00:03:30.760> really<00:03:31.030> start<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.720> said<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.959> feel

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
of really start so like I said I feel

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.809 
of really start so like I said I feel
like<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.500> rumor<00:03:32.859> mail<00:03:33.040> will<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.609> start

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
like the rumor mail will really start

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.180 
like the rumor mail will really start
churning<00:03:34.150> around<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.959> end<00:03:35.139> of<00:03:35.230> 2016<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.099> the

creature of habit when you kind of look

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.740 
creature of habit when you kind of look
at<00:03:54.250> their<00:03:54.489> formula<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.239> stuff<00:03:55.329> that's<00:03:55.599> not<00:03:55.720> a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
at their formula and stuff that's not a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.690 
at their formula and stuff that's not a
bad<00:03:55.959> thing<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.410> makes<00:03:56.739> things<00:03:56.889> a<00:03:57.190> lot<00:03:57.489> less

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
bad thing and makes things a lot less

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.970 
bad thing and makes things a lot less
stressful<00:03:58.060> but<00:03:58.419> uh<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.049> know<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.829> feel

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
stressful but uh you know I just feel

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.830

like<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.400> that's<00:04:00.700> kind<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.060> where<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.630> see

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
like it that's kind of where we see

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.129 
like it that's kind of where we see
reveals<00:04:02.169> in<00:04:02.380> 2019<00:04:03.099> based<00:04:03.310> off<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.639> know<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
reveals in 2019 based off you know the

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.000 
reveals in 2019 based off you know the
development<00:04:05.139> cycles<00:04:05.440> they<00:04:05.530> have<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.889> way

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
development cycles they have the way

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.159 
development cycles they have the way
that<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.340> know<00:04:06.459> work<00:04:06.700> on<00:04:06.880> DLC<00:04:07.359> mods<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.079> then

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
that you know work on DLC mods and then

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.870 
that you know work on DLC mods and then
they<00:04:08.290> bug<00:04:08.500> stop<00:04:08.829> and<00:04:09.069> then<00:04:09.250> they<00:04:09.400> fully<00:04:09.639> move

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
they bug stop and then they fully move

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.000 
they bug stop and then they fully move
on<00:04:10.000> their<00:04:10.150> project<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.660> couple<00:04:10.959> years<00:04:11.169> later<00:04:11.230> so

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
on their project a couple years later so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.199 
on their project a couple years later so
I<00:04:12.040> feel<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:12.280> yeah<00:04:12.549> they'll<00:04:12.730> probably<00:04:12.760> fully

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
I feel like yeah they'll probably fully

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.580 
I feel like yeah they'll probably fully
move<00:04:13.450> on<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.840> development<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.319> whatever

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
move on to the development of whatever

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.750 
move on to the development of whatever
the<00:04:14.709> next<00:04:14.919> game<00:04:15.040> they're<00:04:15.190> working<00:04:15.430> on<00:04:15.519> around

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
the next game they're working on around

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.029 
the next game they're working on around
2017<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:16.660> then<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.229> will<00:04:17.320> be<00:04:17.470> revealed<00:04:17.799> a

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
2017 and then it will be revealed a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.890 
2017 and then it will be revealed a
couple<00:04:18.370> years<00:04:18.489> later<00:04:18.609> probably<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:19.570> anyways

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
couple years later probably but anyways

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.690 
couple years later probably but anyways
that's<00:04:20.079> all<00:04:20.260> just<00:04:20.440> speculation<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:21.250> like

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
that's all just speculation I like
