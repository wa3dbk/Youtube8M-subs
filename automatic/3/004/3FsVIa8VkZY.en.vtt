00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
end games and we'll start with just

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.300 
end games and we'll start with just
simple<00:00:17.670> King<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.029> pawn<00:00:18.180> end<00:00:18.420> games<00:00:19.189> here<00:00:20.189> we

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
simple King and pawn end games here we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
simple King and pawn end games here we
have<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> position<00:00:20.699> where<00:00:21.260> it's<00:00:22.260> black<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.830> move

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
have a position where it's black to move

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
have a position where it's black to move
and<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.900> pawn<00:00:25.220> here<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.369> a4<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.119> obviously

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and this pawn here at a4 is obviously

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
and this pawn here at a4 is obviously
going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> try<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> get<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> a8<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.099> promote<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
going to try to get to a8 to promote to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
going to try to get to a8 to promote to
a<00:00:29.640> queen<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:31.109> King<00:00:31.439> wants<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.920> try<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a queen and this King wants to try to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.950 
a queen and this King wants to try to
catch<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:33.590> problem<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> king<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
catch it problem is that the king is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
catch it problem is that the king is
behind<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> pawn<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:40.129> as<00:00:41.129> long<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.460> white

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
behind the pawn and as long as white

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
behind the pawn and as long as white
keeps<00:00:42.030> moving<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.480> pawn<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.200> King<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:44.070> never

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
keeps moving the pawn the King can never

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.970 
keeps moving the pawn the King can never
catch<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.350> impossible<00:00:47.059> inconceivable

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
catch it it's impossible inconceivable

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.810 
catch it it's impossible inconceivable
that<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> King<00:00:50.789> could<00:00:51.000> catch<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> pawn<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
that the King could catch that pawn and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.600 
that the King could catch that pawn and
yet<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> reason<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
yet and the reason for that is that the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
yet and the reason for that is that the
pawn<00:00:56.820> moves<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:58.109> space<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> King

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
pawn moves from one space and the King

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
pawn moves from one space and the King
was<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.399> space<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> pawn<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> ahead<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
was one space if the pawn is ahead of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.039 
was one space if the pawn is ahead of
the<00:01:00.840> king<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.680> King<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> never<00:01:02.250> catch<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
the king the King can never catch it and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.560 
the king the King can never catch it and
yet<00:01:04.049> I've<00:01:04.260> seen<00:01:04.680> players<00:01:05.210> time<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> again

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
yet I've seen players time and again

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.980 
yet I've seen players time and again
think<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:08.250> maybe<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:09.360> King<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.780> run<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
think that well maybe my King will run a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
think that well maybe my King will run a
little<00:01:10.140> faster<00:01:10.229> somehow<00:01:11.130> somehow<00:01:11.670> something

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
little faster somehow somehow something

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.100 
little faster somehow somehow something
will<00:01:12.180> happen<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> I'll<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.720> able<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> catch

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
will happen that I'll be able to catch

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
will happen that I'll be able to catch
that<00:01:13.140> partly<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.369> can't<00:01:14.640> catch<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> pawn

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that partly they can't catch the pawn

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
that partly they can't catch the pawn
how<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> tell<00:01:16.290> whether<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.830> catch

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
how can you tell whether you can catch

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
how can you tell whether you can catch
the<00:01:17.189> pawn<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> simple<00:01:18.150> rule<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.600> I'll

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the pawn there's a simple rule and I'll

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.210 
the pawn there's a simple rule and I'll
show<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.890> called<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
show it to you right now it's called the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
show it to you right now it's called the
square<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.030> pawn<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> show<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
square of the pawn I'm going to show you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.050 
square of the pawn I'm going to show you
the<00:01:22.470> concept<00:01:22.619> called<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> square<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the concept called the square of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.620 
the concept called the square of the
pawn<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> rule<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.939> deciding

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
pawn and this is a rule for deciding

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.569 
pawn and this is a rule for deciding
whether<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.380> catch<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> pawn<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
whether or not you can catch the pawn so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
whether or not you can catch the pawn so
here<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> pawn<00:01:33.360> White<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> pawn<00:01:34.619> at

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
here we have a pawn White has a pawn at

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
here we have a pawn White has a pawn at
a<00:01:34.920> four<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.320> black<00:01:37.530> king<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:39.229> f3<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
a four and the black king is at f3 and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.710 
a four and the black king is at f3 and
black<00:01:41.340> wants<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> blacks<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.570> black

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
black wants it's blacks move and black

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
black wants it's blacks move and black
wants<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.409> decide<00:01:44.369> whether<00:01:44.640> he<00:01:44.820> should<00:01:44.880> resign

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
wants to decide whether he should resign

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.920 
wants to decide whether he should resign
or<00:01:45.829> whether<00:01:46.829> he<00:01:47.040> should<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.700> ahead<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.750> chase

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
or whether he should go ahead and chase

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.889 
or whether he should go ahead and chase
that<00:01:48.960> pawn<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> tell<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.630> by

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that pawn and the way to tell is by

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.999 
that pawn and the way to tell is by
drawing<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.560> square<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.470> start<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
drawing a square if you start with the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.740 
drawing a square if you start with the
pawn<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> corner<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.869> make<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> diagonal

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
pawn at a corner and make a diagonal

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.859 
pawn at a corner and make a diagonal
down<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> last<00:02:01.290> row<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.509> treat<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> as

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
down to the last row and treat that as

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.910 
down to the last row and treat that as
the<00:02:04.049> opposite<00:02:04.469> diagonal<00:02:04.740> corner<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the opposite diagonal corner and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.999 
the opposite diagonal corner and
visualize<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> square<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.319> formed<00:02:10.770> by

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
visualize the square that is formed by

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.130 
visualize the square that is formed by
the<00:02:13.130> though<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.490> diagonal<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.280> here<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the though that diagonal so here the

diagonal starts at a four ends at e8 the
other<00:02:23.550> corner<00:02:23.850> would<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.060> e<00:02:24.090> four<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.200> eight

other corner would be e four and a eight

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.850 
other corner would be e four and a eight
if<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> visualize<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> Square<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
if you can visualize that Square and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.710 
if you can visualize that Square and
visualization<00:02:31.860> ability<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.540> your

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
visualization ability to see in your

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.650 
visualization ability to see in your
mind<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.830> very<00:02:35.130> important<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.730> chess<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.209> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
mind is very important in chess and you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.400 
mind is very important in chess and you
should<00:02:36.870> work<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.319> developing<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:39.410> so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
should work at developing that and so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.259 
should work at developing that and so
try<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> visualize<00:02:41.160> actually<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:42.060> that

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
try to visualize actually see that

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.410 
try to visualize actually see that
square<00:02:43.130> if<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.400> King<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.880> move<00:02:45.060> into<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
square if the King can move into the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.440 
square if the King can move into the
square<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.050> he<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.380> catch<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.860> pawn<00:02:47.450> so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
square and then he can catch the pawn so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.110 
square and then he can catch the pawn so
in<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.690> case<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.890> move<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> only<00:02:50.880> move

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
in this case the move of the only move

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
in this case the move of the only move
that<00:02:51.150> allows<00:02:51.630> black<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.260> catch<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.620> pawn<00:02:52.890> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
that allows black to catch that pawn is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.949 
that allows black to catch that pawn is
to<00:02:54.000> move<00:02:54.150> from<00:02:54.480> f3<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.860> e4<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:57.769> watch<00:02:58.769> how

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
to move from f3 to e4 and watch how

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.070 
to move from f3 to e4 and watch how
black<00:03:00.959> keeps<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> pawn<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.080> catches

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
black keeps up with the pawn and catches

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.580 
black keeps up with the pawn and catches
it<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:05.069> as<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> turns<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> queen<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.590> it's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
it just as it turns to a queen and it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.699 
it just as it turns to a queen and it's
a<00:03:07.650> draw<00:03:08.299> now<00:03:09.299> suppose<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.959> were<00:03:10.230> White's

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
a draw now suppose that it were White's

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.449 
a draw now suppose that it were White's
move<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.390> case<00:03:12.660> white<00:03:13.500> moves<00:03:13.829> his<00:03:14.130> pawn

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
move in that case white moves his pawn

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.810 
move in that case white moves his pawn
to<00:03:15.420> a5<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.410> now<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.890> square<00:03:17.310> has<00:03:17.519> gotten

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
to a5 and now the square has gotten

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.819 
to a5 and now the square has gotten
smaller<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:20.700> only<00:03:21.030> four<00:03:21.959> squares

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
smaller you see it is only four squares

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.789 
smaller you see it is only four squares
by<00:03:23.040> four<00:03:23.280> squares<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:25.230> King<00:03:25.410> can't<00:03:25.680> move

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
by four squares and the King can't move

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.630 
by four squares and the King can't move
into<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.250> square<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.730> pond

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.890 

check<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.790> it'll<00:03:34.000> be<00:03:34.120> checkmate<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> few

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
check and it'll be checkmate in a few

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.500 
check and it'll be checkmate in a few
moves<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.700> that's<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.000> simple<00:03:37.300> rule<00:03:37.480> for

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
moves so that's a simple rule for

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.160 
moves so that's a simple rule for
deciding<00:03:37.840> whether<00:03:38.530> or<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.800> your<00:03:39.370> king<00:03:39.670> can

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
deciding whether or not your king can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.990 
deciding whether or not your king can
catch<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.410> pawn<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.459> useful<00:03:42.640> in

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
catch the pawn and this is useful in

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.720 
catch the pawn and this is useful in
visualizing<00:03:43.480> several<00:03:44.200> moves<00:03:44.410> ahead<00:03:44.560> if<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
visualizing several moves ahead if you

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.150 
visualizing several moves ahead if you
can<00:03:45.940> see<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> position<00:03:46.780> coming<00:03:47.110> where<00:03:47.920> your

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
can see a position coming where your

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.800 
can see a position coming where your
king<00:03:48.400> will<00:03:48.610> be<00:03:48.760> outside<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.540> square<00:03:49.780> of

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
king will be outside of the square of

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.660 
king will be outside of the square of
the<00:03:49.930> pawn<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.410> may<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.980> take<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.370> into

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
the pawn you may want to take that into

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.880 
the pawn you may want to take that into
consideration<00:03:51.700> in<00:03:52.660> making<00:03:52.989> your<00:03:53.709> plans<00:03:53.950> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
consideration in making your plans and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.330 
consideration in making your plans and
vice<00:03:56.890> versa<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.680> one<00:03:59.860> thing<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.099> should

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
vice versa there is one thing you should

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.789 
vice versa there is one thing you should
keep<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.910> mind<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:01.780> what<00:04:02.200> happens<00:04:02.590> if

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
keep in mind and that is what happens if

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.720 
keep in mind and that is what happens if
the<00:04:02.830> pawn<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.400> still<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.330> its<00:04:04.510> original<00:04:04.989> square

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
the pawn is still on its original square

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.180 
the pawn is still on its original square
let's<00:04:06.730> take<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> brief<00:04:07.330> look<00:04:07.390> at<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:09.010> let's

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
let's take a brief look at that so let's

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.680 
let's take a brief look at that so let's
take<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.549> case<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:12.190> pawn<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.519> at<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.180> two

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
take this case and the pawn is at a two

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.190 
take this case and the pawn is at a two
and<00:04:14.319> you<00:04:14.860> see<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.160> square<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.610> pawn<00:04:15.819> would

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
and you see the square of the pawn would

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.110 
and you see the square of the pawn would
go<00:04:17.200> from<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.680> two<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:19.560> g8<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.739> here<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> g2<00:04:21.880> and

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
go from a two to g8 and here to g2 and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.480 
go from a two to g8 and here to g2 and
up<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.320> 8<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.880> 2<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.540> g8<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.710> g2<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.340> would<00:04:27.430> be

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
up to 8 a 2 to a g8 to g2 that would be

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.180 
up to 8 a 2 to a g8 to g2 that would be
the<00:04:27.610> square<00:04:28.380> but<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> problem<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
the square but the problem is that the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.219 
the square but the problem is that the
pawn<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.580> make<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.729> two<00:04:31.090> step<00:04:31.360> move<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:32.020> his

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
pawn can make a two step move on his

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:32.940 
pawn can make a two step move on his
first<00:04:32.410> move

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
first move

the<00:04:37.840> square<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.260> pond<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:39.250> by<00:04:39.400> moving<00:04:39.639> to

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
the square of the pond just by moving to

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.350 
the square of the pond just by moving to
g8<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:41.320> white<00:04:42.039> makes<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.520> two-step<00:04:42.970> move<00:04:43.210> and

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
g8 but white makes the two-step move and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
g8 but white makes the two-step move and
now<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.539> square<00:04:44.050> has<00:04:44.260> contracted<00:04:44.950> by<00:04:45.600> by<00:04:46.600> two

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
now the square has contracted by by two

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.790 
now the square has contracted by by two
squares<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:49.950> black<00:04:50.950> can't<00:04:51.310> get<00:04:51.520> into<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:52.800> so

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
squares and black can't get into it so

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.350 
squares and black can't get into it so
that's<00:04:54.010> all<00:04:54.130> I've<00:04:54.250> got<00:04:54.400> for<00:04:54.430> today<00:04:54.639> on<00:04:55.000> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.060 
that's all I've got for today on the
square<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.930> pawn<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.350> hope<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.919> learned
