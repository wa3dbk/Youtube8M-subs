these tiles in Photoshop a couple of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
these tiles in Photoshop a couple of
years<00:00:21.869> ago<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.500> them<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.800> nookcolor<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.519> a

years ago I use them my nookcolor for a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
years ago I use them my nookcolor for a
while<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:24.689> launch<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.109> come<00:00:25.260> out

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
while but then a new launch was come out

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.929 
while but then a new launch was come out
recently<00:00:25.529> called<00:00:25.920> tile<00:00:26.189> launcher<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
recently called tile launcher which is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.939 
recently called tile launcher which is
basically<00:00:27.269> windows<00:00:27.689> phone<00:00:27.930> 8<00:00:28.109> them<00:00:28.650> sort<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
basically windows phone 8 them sort of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.970 
basically windows phone 8 them sort of
style<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.289> manipulate<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
style which can actually manipulate to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
style which can actually manipulate to
scroll<00:00:32.189> vertically<00:00:33.030> rather<00:00:33.120> than

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
scroll vertically rather than

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
scroll vertically rather than
horizontally<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.500> makes<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
horizontally and this makes it kind of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340 
horizontally and this makes it kind of
cool<00:00:35.280> she<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.940> tiles<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
cool she can have these tiles here and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
cool she can have these tiles here and
you<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.180> your

it's free at the moment it's in beta it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's free at the moment it's in beta it
is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:10.950> slow<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.490> buggy

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is a little bit slow and buggy

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
is a little bit slow and buggy
occasionally<00:01:12.360> although<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:14.100> for

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
occasionally although for this just for

occasionally although for this just for
this<00:01:14.340> sat<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.240> page<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.810> as

this sat up with just one page it's as

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
this sat up with just one page it's as
you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.040> fluid<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> sort<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you can see pretty fluid and it sort of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
you can see pretty fluid and it sort of
does<00:01:18.210> everything<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
does everything you want it to do the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.499 
does everything you want it to do the
main<00:01:20.520> issue<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> moment<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
main issue at the moment is that you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.320 
main issue at the moment is that you
can't<00:01:21.750> open<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> applications<00:01:23.159> draw<00:01:23.640> via<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
can't open the applications draw via a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.820 
can't open the applications draw via a
widget<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.560> another

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
widget so you have to use another

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.149 
widget so you have to use another
application<00:01:27.409> which<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.650> using<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
application which I'm using which is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
application which I'm using which is
called<00:01:29.430> folder<00:01:29.790> organizer<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.900> lets

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
called folder organizer which just lets

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.910 
called folder organizer which just lets
you<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.470> act<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:31.890> your

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you actually act as all your

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
you actually act as all your
applications<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> little

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
applications you can see it is a little

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.670 
applications you can see it is a little
bit<00:01:33.450> slow<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
bit slow in that just because it is a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
bit slow in that just because it is a
sort<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.390> separate<00:01:36.390> application<00:01:36.509> running

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
sort of a separate application running

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
sort of a separate application running
on<00:01:37.200> top<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> launcher<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> works<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
on top of the launcher but it works and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
on top of the launcher but it works and
works<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> purpose<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> actual<00:01:40.320> idea

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
works the purpose and the actual idea

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.780 
works the purpose and the actual idea
behind<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.100> launcher<00:01:41.369> means<00:01:41.549> most

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
behind the launcher means most

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
behind the launcher means most
applications<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.600> using<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> day-to-day

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
applications are using a day-to-day

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
applications are using a day-to-day

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
a windows phone 8 type thing I think

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.630 
a windows phone 8 type thing I think
it's<00:02:44.440> kind<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.650> nice<00:02:44.800> it's<00:02:45.010> quite<00:02:45.160> minimalist

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
but at the same time I think it looks

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.200 
but at the same time I think it looks
quite<00:02:47.470> functional<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.250> looks<00:02:48.460> it<00:02:49.180> looks
