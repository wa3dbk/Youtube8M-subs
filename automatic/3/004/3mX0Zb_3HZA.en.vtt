00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
something like that and for that that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.020 
something like that and for that that
seemed<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.939> not

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
seemed like a lot of people that's not

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
seemed like a lot of people that's not
so<00:01:39.270> much<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.720> us<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.560> for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so much but for us that was a lot for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
so much but for us that was a lot for
preparing<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.119> race<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.259> needed

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
preparing for this race so we needed

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
preparing for this race so we needed
just<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.430> protection<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
just a little more protection but I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.819 
just a little more protection but I
didn't<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.229> away<00:01:46.350> from<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
didn't want to get away from the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
didn't want to get away from the
minimalist<00:01:47.340> too<00:01:48.180> far<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> stray

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
minimalist too far I don't want to stray

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
minimalist too far I don't want to stray
too<00:01:49.020> far<00:01:49.200> although<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> people<00:01:50.340> say

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
too far although a lot of people say

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.160 
too far although a lot of people say
this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.180> minimalist<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.110> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this is not minimalist because there are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
this is not minimalist because there are
a<00:01:52.200> lot<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> foam<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:54.270> shoes<00:01:54.689> have

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a lot of foam here but these shoes have

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.910 
a lot of foam here but these shoes have
very<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:57.329> minimal<00:01:57.960> protection<00:01:58.200> you're

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
very just minimal protection you're

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
very just minimal protection you're
really<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.159> looking<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.729> EV<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:01.460> foot<00:02:02.460> sole

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
really just looking at EV a foot sole

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.980 
really just looking at EV a foot sole
here<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.560> insole<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:06.000> sole<00:02:06.270> material

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
here this insole here the sole material

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.499 
here this insole here the sole material
here<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> yellow<00:02:07.500> material<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.390> that's<00:02:09.390> what

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
here you yellow material and that's what

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
here you yellow material and that's what
gives<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> light<00:02:10.259> weight<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.649> there's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
gives it a light weight because there's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
gives it a light weight because there's
not<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
not much there now what I really like is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
not much there now what I really like is
this<00:02:12.810> mesh

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this mesh

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
this mesh
this<00:02:14.190> mesh<00:02:14.660> upper<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.730> breathes

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this mesh upper which really breathes

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
this mesh upper which really breathes
well<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.319> couple<00:02:19.800> things<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.670> as

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
well so you couple things going there as

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.100 
well so you couple things going there as
one<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.270> have<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> very<00:02:21.810> flexible<00:02:22.560> very

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
one is you have a very flexible very

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.040 
one is you have a very flexible very
flexible<00:02:25.110> sole<00:02:26.090> very<00:02:27.090> flat<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> flexes<00:02:27.930> in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
flexible sole very flat it flexes in

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.440 
flexible sole very flat it flexes in
different<00:02:28.380> ways<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:29.550> has<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> minimal<00:02:30.270> amount

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
different ways it has a minimal amount

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.930 
different ways it has a minimal amount
of<00:02:30.750> tread<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.770> see<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.130> black<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.760> where

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
of tread you can see this black is where

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400 
of tread you can see this black is where
the<00:02:33.030> wear<00:02:33.239> protection<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.900> get<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.319> bit

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the wear protection is get a little bit

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.600 
the wear protection is get a little bit
of<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:34.980> because<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.459> just

run on the EDA but you really should be

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.270 
run on the EDA but you really should be
striking<00:02:39.000> mid-foot<00:02:39.480> anyway<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.350> that's<00:02:40.860> kind

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
striking mid-foot anyway and that's kind

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.960 
striking mid-foot anyway and that's kind

the mesh is very breathable and that's I
I<00:02:49.769> know<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.980> don't<00:02:50.220> use<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.700> green<00:02:50.880> silence

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
also very breathable aren't I absolutely

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030 
also very breathable aren't I absolutely
and<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> did<00:02:56.970> run<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.510> did<00:02:57.690> run<00:02:57.870> into<00:02:58.500> racing

very<00:03:02.910> good<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.269> lacing<00:03:03.690> system<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.800> got<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
very good the lacing system it's got a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.940 
very good the lacing system it's got a
one<00:03:05.580> sided<00:03:05.880> tongue<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.709> grab

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
one sided tongue on this can you grab

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
one sided tongue on this can you grab
the<00:03:08.100> bottom<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.489> soul<00:03:08.760> formula<00:03:09.239> shooting

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the bottom that soul formula shooting

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.900 
the bottom that soul formula shooting
one-handed<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.340> see<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
one-handed here and you see that the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
one-handed here and you see that the
tongue<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.330> just<00:03:12.600> one-sided<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.040> kind<00:03:14.280> of

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
tongue is just one-sided and it kind of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.090 
tongue is just one-sided and it kind of
has<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.580> curve<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.690> not<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.500> i<00:03:16.650> laced<00:03:16.890> it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
has a curve to it it's not if i laced it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.530 
has a curve to it it's not if i laced it
up<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.400> little<00:03:17.519> bit<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.360> see

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
up a little bit like that you can see

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.180 
up a little bit like that you can see
that's<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.170> laced<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.860> little<00:03:20.070> bit

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that's it's laced a little bit

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.890 
that's it's laced a little bit
differently<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.030> takes<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> pressure

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
differently and that takes the pressure

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.440 
differently and that takes the pressure
off<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.620> those<00:03:22.769> spots<00:03:23.130> where<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> have

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
off some of those spots where you have

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
off some of those spots where you have
some<00:03:25.019> big<00:03:25.170> veins<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.610> blood<00:03:26.790> vessels<00:03:26.820> and

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
some big veins and blood vessels and

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.880 
some big veins and blood vessels and
helps<00:03:28.739> with<00:03:28.890> circulation<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.730> your<00:03:29.760> foot<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
helps with circulation in your foot and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.229 
helps with circulation in your foot and
found<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.040> be<00:03:32.100> very<00:03:32.160> comfortable<00:03:33.030> very

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
found it to be very comfortable very

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.940 
found it to be very comfortable very
breathable<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.650> don't<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.730> high<00:03:36.030> arch

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
breathable I don't like a high arch

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.860 
breathable I don't like a high arch
because<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.040> go<00:03:38.160> barefoot<00:03:38.670> good<00:03:39.510> part<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
because I go barefoot good part of the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
because I go barefoot good part of the
time<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.769> there's<00:03:40.920> not<00:03:41.100> much<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.459> an<00:03:41.579> arch<00:03:41.760> in

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
time so there's not much of an arch in

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.630 
time so there's not much of an arch in
there<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.329> it's<00:03:42.450> very<00:03:42.570> very<00:03:42.720> neutral<00:03:43.620> shoe<00:03:44.070> if

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
there so it's very very neutral shoe if

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.460 
there so it's very very neutral shoe if
you<00:03:44.790> need<00:03:44.940> support<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.540> lot<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.810> support<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.410> a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you need support a lot of support and a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.349 
you need support a lot of support and a
lot<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.650> correction<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.760> may<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.209> the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
lot of correction this may not be the
