morning<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.310> started<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> braiding<00:00:21.510> my

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
morning I started on braiding my

morning I started on braiding my
sections<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.949> usually<00:00:23.340> use<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.699> method

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
sections and I usually use this method

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.310 
sections and I usually use this method
to<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:25.099> nicely<00:00:26.099> curly<00:00:26.519> braiding<00:00:27.420> laid<00:00:28.170> out

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
to get my nicely curly braiding laid out

yeah then I started cutting my lines and
I<00:00:35.850> taught<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.329> angles<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:37.850> diagonal<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> each

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I taught at angles or diagonal and each

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
I taught at angles or diagonal and each
time<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.440> doing<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:40.860> twists<00:00:41.399> you're

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
going to have to be detangling the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
going to have to be detangling the
balance<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> how<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> detangle<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
balance of how much you detangle to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
balance of how much you detangle to
previous<00:00:44.789> day<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
will showcase let us add a diagonal okay

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:07.030 
will showcase let us add a diagonal okay
first<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.309> angle<00:00:53.960> its<00:00:54.960> value<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040

there now cause everything has been
offset<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.940> can<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.350> another<00:01:43.950> line

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
offset I can then have another line

00:01:44.280 --> 00:02:00.530 
offset I can then have another line
which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.300> at<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:46.229> angle<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:58.700> use<00:01:59.700> pins<00:02:00.150> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
which is now at an angle I use pins to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.480 
which is now at an angle I use pins to
keep<00:02:00.720> my<00:02:00.930> hair<00:02:04.550> then<00:02:05.550> first<00:02:06.210> twist<00:02:06.840> down<00:02:07.490> gonna

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490

keep my hair then first twist down gonna
go<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.880> second<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.920> let

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
go to my second and I will get in let

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.000 
go to my second and I will get in let
make<00:02:11.820> sure<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:12.510> no<00:02:12.630> I'm<00:02:15.680> fine

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
make sure there's no I'm fine

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.090 
make sure there's no I'm fine
then<00:02:17.580> whoa<00:02:18.680> dirty<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.320> change<00:02:22.620> direction

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
then whoa dirty then I change direction

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.430 
then whoa dirty then I change direction
for<00:02:23.760> my<00:02:23.880> choice<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.600> they<00:02:24.930> don't<00:02:24.989> call

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
for my choice so that they don't call

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
for my choice so that they don't call
them<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.770> individual<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.790> they

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
them with individual because if they

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.030 
them with individual because if they
follow<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.330> direction<00:02:27.570> we're<00:02:28.500> basically<00:02:28.800> not

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
follow the direction we're basically not

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.060 
follow the direction we're basically not
immunity<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.480> change<00:02:30.989> directions<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
immunity so I change directions with a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.100 
immunity so I change directions with a
15<00:02:33.590> mixture<00:02:36.709> ocular<00:02:37.970> three<00:02:38.970> hours<00:02:39.570> later

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
15 mixture ocular three hours later

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.060 
15 mixture ocular three hours later
so<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.860> will<00:02:41.130> try<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.870> slow<00:02:42.870> down<00:02:44.269> pretty

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.680 

something<00:02:50.070> morning<00:02:50.940> green<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.540> falling<00:02:53.690> okay

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
something morning green is falling okay

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.680 
something morning green is falling okay
so<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:55.980> at<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.450> no

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
so you can see at the top there is no

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
so you can see at the top there is no
fullness<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.799> bottom<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.400> fullness

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
fullness but at the bottom this fullness

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.199 
fullness but at the bottom this fullness
and<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.810> ah<00:03:01.019> they're<00:03:01.709> looking<00:03:02.690> for<00:03:03.690> 20

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
and a like ah they're looking for 20

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.560 
and a like ah they're looking for 20
acceptable<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:07.049> I'm<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.350> rotating<00:03:07.560> around

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
acceptable so I'm just rotating around

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.070 
acceptable so I'm just rotating around
they<00:03:09.570> look<00:03:09.739> staggered<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.280> diagonal<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.390> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
they look staggered and diagonal and it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.180 
they look staggered and diagonal and it
actually<00:03:13.620> give<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.980> that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.570 

so<00:03:19.190> what<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:20.000> try<00:03:20.270> to<00:03:20.330> keep<00:03:20.630> line<00:03:20.960> twist<00:03:21.830> at

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
so what I do I try to keep line twist at

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.360 
so what I do I try to keep line twist at
a<00:03:22.640> stress<00:03:23.150> state<00:03:23.710> while<00:03:24.710> I'm<00:03:24.950> trying<00:03:25.250> to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
a stress state while I'm trying to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.120 
a stress state while I'm trying to
finish<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.910> rest<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.750> because<00:03:27.710> I<00:03:27.980> think
