 to be used at the level there is too much 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.820
 it's the same principle as the real thing 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.630
 bomberman in fact they know ya 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.640
 just a restriction is when there is 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.560
 three survivors we have the right to place 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.220
 two beings two heads at a time when he 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.840
 there are two survivors c4 tmt then 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.320

 i heard the debility killed dg not here 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:02:13.000
 fruit guiboles that after less then 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 we have the right to ask two phones 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.670
 that's it yeah at e3 4 4 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.850
 we come to elegance and a second 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.660
 sleeve we find ourselves right now so 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.430
 second run second run you are 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:51.310
 ready it's gone there is someone who 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:03:00.200
 the better before here no questions 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:02.800
 it's normal it's me these rots 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.010
 punctured 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:14.110
 you have the right 4 tnt in a row the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.110
 grand cru non battle pape 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.610
 it says anyway and it connects the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.950
 good new now goes to Lille 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 to the end for the wall so what 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.340
 what is the wall is a game 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.099
 same principle as this turn it takes 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.050
 run on a pontoon and the goal is to 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.989
 place a square of a led 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.700
 ap i managed in a specific hole 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.400
 so you see here I managed I'm the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.910
 blue to be specific high seven places 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.709
 and the wool during its fall and the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.340
 first who gets to fill them all and 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.800
 wins the game 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.200
 and we can do three types of level 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.720
 ie difficult or to fill 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.459
 the five cubes of his color 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.190
 we will do normal mode we need 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.840
 fill that 3 and then the easy mode 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.110
 it is the first who succeeds in putting a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.730
 cube in the hole that succeeds I you 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.079
 warn this game is very hard to dole and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:29.250
 never happens since even the snow 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:36.870
 Legal have catechists and after that 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:39.260

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.040
 go up each time and if we get 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:53.240

 rather difficult game 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.600
 frankly but as we said at 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.950
