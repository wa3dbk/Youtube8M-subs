receiver the traction stuff has a
waterproof<00:00:47.670> box<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.659> little<00:00:48.809> more

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
waterproof box so it's a little more

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
waterproof box so it's a little more
difficult<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> deal<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.730> but<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
difficult to deal with but as you can

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.779 
difficult to deal with but as you can
see<00:00:53.870> real<00:00:54.870> basic<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:55.679> your<00:00:55.980> different

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
see real basic you've got your different

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.829 
see real basic you've got your different
channels<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.210> throttle<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:59.510> your<00:01:00.510> steering

channels for throttle for your steering

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.569 
channels for throttle for your steering
servo<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.620> you've<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> bind<00:01:02.190> option

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
servo and then you've got a bind option

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.630 
servo and then you've got a bind option
a<00:01:02.850> couple<00:01:03.210> extra<00:01:03.480> channels<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.519> then<00:01:05.519> you've

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
a couple extra channels and then you've

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.889 
a couple extra channels and then you've
got<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:07.460> cable<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:08.759> is<00:01:08.910> just<00:01:08.940> how<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
got your cable here which is just how it

got your cable here which is just how it
communicates<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:11.280> receiver<00:01:12.170> two<00:01:13.170> main

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
communicates with your receiver two main

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.649 
communicates with your receiver two main
reasons<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.800> go<00:01:14.039> to<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.659> multi-unit

4x4<00:02:16.049> here<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> already<00:02:16.440> preset<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.850> as<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
4x4 here I already preset that so as you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.490 
4x4 here I already preset that so as you
scroll<00:02:18.420> through<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.720> models<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.350> which

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
scroll through the models you know which

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.280 
scroll through the models you know which
model<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:22.140> select

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
model it is and you can just select

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
model it is and you can just select
select<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.130> right<00:02:23.280> away<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:24.150> off<00:02:24.269> and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
select it right away and be off and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.940 
select it right away and be off and
racing<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:24.900> everything<00:02:25.230> already<00:02:25.380> preset

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
racing have everything already preset

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.539 
racing have everything already preset
for<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.310> um

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.670 

so<00:02:30.709> let's<00:02:31.709> go<00:02:31.829> ahead<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.099> connect<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.680> servo

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so let's go ahead and connect the servo

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.360 
so let's go ahead and connect the servo
and<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.900> ESC<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.079> this<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.469> had<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> do<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.189> little

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and the ESC to this I had to do a little

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.599 
and the ESC to this I had to do a little
custom<00:02:38.879> modification<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.189> ESC<00:02:41.189> cable

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
custom modification on the ESC cable

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.190 
custom modification on the ESC cable
because<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.909> had<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> little<00:02:42.209> tab<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.569> it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
because it had a little tab on it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
because it had a little tab on it
the<00:02:43.620> original<00:02:44.810> Traxxas<00:02:46.340> piece<00:02:47.340> has<00:02:47.970> little

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the original Traxxas piece has little

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.780 
the original Traxxas piece has little
slots<00:02:49.189> along<00:02:50.189> the<00:02:50.400> top<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:52.790> they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
slots along the top there and they

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.940 
slots along the top there and they
didn't<00:02:54.060> fit<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.299> this<00:02:54.389> little<00:02:54.450> guy<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.620> let's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
didn't fit in this little guy so let's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
didn't fit in this little guy so let's
go<00:02:56.099> ahead<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.310> add<00:02:56.519> these<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.510> we've<00:02:57.750> got

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
go ahead and add these in so we've got

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:08.759 
go ahead and add these in so we've got
the<00:02:59.989> throttle<00:03:00.989> here

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.110 

now<00:03:09.769> we've<00:03:09.920> got<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.189> steering

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.440 

will<00:03:15.599> fit<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.050> nicely<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:18.270> going<00:03:18.390> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
will fit in nicely and we're going to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
will fit in nicely and we're going to
bind<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.989> while<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.099> disassembled<00:03:20.849> like

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
bind it while it's all disassembled like

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.870 
bind it while it's all disassembled like
this<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.770> why<00:03:22.770> bind<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:23.489> button

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
this because why bind it and then button

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.250 
this because why bind it and then button
then<00:03:24.030> package<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.569> up<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.810> find<00:03:25.020> out<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
then package it all up and find out it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.830 
then package it all up and find out it
doesn't<00:03:25.319> work<00:03:26.180> also<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.510> thing<00:03:27.660> you're<00:03:27.750> gonna

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
doesn't work also the thing you're gonna

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.839 
doesn't work also the thing you're gonna
have<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.050> do<00:03:28.140> after<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.530> bind<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.069> run<00:03:29.760> this

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
have to do after you bind it is run this

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.720 
have to do after you bind it is run this
cable<00:03:30.209> out<00:03:30.300> through<00:03:30.510> your<00:03:30.630> antenna<00:03:30.959> wire

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
cable out through your antenna wire

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
cable out through your antenna wire
which<00:03:32.730> was<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.239> pain<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.599> disassemble

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
which was kind of a pain to disassemble

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.330 
which was kind of a pain to disassemble
it's<00:03:34.290> probably<00:03:34.590> cuz<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.830> was<00:03:34.920> put<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's probably cuz that was put in at the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.490 
it's probably cuz that was put in at the
factory<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.880> was<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.360> tight<00:03:36.599> Eddie's<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
factory it was really tight Eddie's the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.250 
factory it was really tight Eddie's the
needlenose<00:03:37.890> actually<00:03:38.340> pull<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.519> out<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
needlenose actually pull that out so the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.229 
needlenose actually pull that out so the
binding<00:03:40.560> process<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:41.340> actually<00:03:41.970> quite<00:03:42.150> simple

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
binding process is actually quite simple

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.479 
binding process is actually quite simple
there's<00:03:45.239> several<00:03:45.739> those<00:03:46.739> cellar<00:03:46.980> steps<00:03:47.310> so

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
there's several those cellar steps so

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.039 
there's several those cellar steps so
with<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> receiver<00:03:48.540> off<00:03:50.660> insert<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.810> bind

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
with the receiver off insert the bind

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.650 
with the receiver off insert the bind
plug<00:03:52.319> into<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.890> battery<00:03:53.250> by<00:03:53.430> import<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.090> every

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
plug into the battery by import so every

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.570 
plug into the battery by import so every
time<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.959> buy<00:03:54.989> one<00:03:55.319> of<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:55.470> things<00:03:55.769> it's

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
time you buy one of these things it's

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.589 
time you buy one of these things it's
going<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.790> come<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.090> bind<00:03:57.959> plug<00:03:59.599> assuming

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
going to come with a bind plug assuming

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.720 
going to come with a bind plug assuming
you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.870> probably<00:04:01.140> just<00:04:01.519> shoot<00:04:02.519> some<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
you can probably just shoot some of

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.570 
you can probably just shoot some of
these<00:04:02.819> are<00:04:02.970> interchangeable<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:05.430> is

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
these are interchangeable but this is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.030 
these are interchangeable but this is
the<00:04:05.670> bind<00:04:05.849> plug<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.870> spectrum<00:04:07.260> kit<00:04:07.470> don't

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the bind plug for the spectrum kit don't

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:18.460 
the bind plug for the spectrum kit don't
want<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.220> lose<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.220> we'll<00:04:11.459> insert<00:04:11.610> that

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.580 

okay<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.400> then<00:04:20.269> let's<00:04:20.810> power<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.320> receiver

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
okay and then let's power the receiver

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680 
okay and then let's power the receiver
we<00:04:24.590> should<00:04:24.770> seize<00:04:24.980> an<00:04:25.130> amber<00:04:25.520> LED<00:04:25.970> flashing

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
we should seize an amber LED flashing

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.010 
we should seize an amber LED flashing
which<00:04:26.960> we<00:04:27.140> do<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.970> can<00:04:29.120> see<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.480> on<00:04:29.960> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
which we do you can see this on the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.650 
which we do you can see this on the
camera<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.760> basically<00:04:32.120> searching<00:04:32.420> for<00:04:32.630> a

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
camera this is basically searching for a

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.030 
camera this is basically searching for a
signal<00:04:32.840> just<00:04:33.140> like<00:04:33.320> if<00:04:33.440> you're<00:04:33.530> binding<00:04:33.770> your

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
signal just like if you're binding your

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040 
signal just like if you're binding your
Xbox<00:04:34.430> 360<00:04:34.970> controller<00:04:35.330> or<00:04:35.540> any<00:04:35.690> wireless

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
Xbox 360 controller or any wireless

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.400 
Xbox 360 controller or any wireless
stuff<00:04:36.670> that's<00:04:37.670> what<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:37.940> see<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:39.050> next<00:04:39.260> thing

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
stuff that's what you see the next thing

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.470 
stuff that's what you see the next thing
is<00:04:39.560> we<00:04:40.550> need<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.760> turn<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.090> transmitter

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
is we need to turn on that transmitter

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.720 
is we need to turn on that transmitter
and<00:04:42.440> make<00:04:42.590> sure<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> transmitter<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.610> the

and make sure the transmitter is on the
desired<00:04:44.030> model<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:44.510> this<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.780> specific<00:04:45.260> to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
desired model so this is specific to

desired model so this is specific to
this<00:04:45.500> guy<00:04:45.970> if<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.110> multiple<00:04:48.500> ma<00:04:48.680> if

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
this guy if you have multiple ma if

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.260 
this guy if you have multiple ma if
you're<00:04:49.070> just<00:04:49.220> binding<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> single<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:52.910> single

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
you're just binding a single a single

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.140 
you're just binding a single a single
new<00:04:54.020> receiver<00:04:54.740> just<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.490> have<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.640> 2.4

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
new receiver just so you have a 2.4

you<00:04:58.670> don't<00:04:58.820> really<00:04:58.910> have<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> worry<00:04:59.270> about

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
you don't really have to worry about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.900 
you don't really have to worry about
selecting<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.810> model<00:05:00.460> but<00:05:01.460> I'm<00:05:01.580> going<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.760> do

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
selecting the model but I'm going to do

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.140 
selecting the model but I'm going to do
that<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:03.820> model<00:05:04.820> /<00:05:05.350> okay<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.730> then<00:05:07.730> we<00:05:07.910> need<00:05:08.060> to

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
that so model / okay and then we need to

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.790 
that so model / okay and then we need to
go<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.600> bind<00:05:08.810> option<00:05:09.290> sometimes<00:05:09.500> we'll

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
go to the bind option sometimes we'll

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.850 
go to the bind option sometimes we'll
just<00:05:09.950> have<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.100> button<00:05:10.960> on<00:05:11.960> there<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.650> will

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
just have a button on there that will

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.400 
just have a button on there that will
start<00:05:13.130> searching<00:05:13.340> for<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.730> signal<00:05:14.170> this<00:05:15.170> is<00:05:15.230> a

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
start searching for the signal this is a

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.590 
start searching for the signal this is a
little<00:05:15.620> more<00:05:15.740> advanced<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.250> little<00:05:16.460> nicer<00:05:16.760> so<00:05:17.570> I

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
little more advanced a little nicer so I

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.130 
little more advanced a little nicer so I
just<00:05:17.780> select<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.110> bind<00:05:18.320> option<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:23.750> says

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
just select the bind option and it says

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.080 
just select the bind option and it says
here<00:05:24.820> user<00:05:25.820> name<00:05:26.090> /<00:05:26.870> 4x4<00:05:27.380> replace<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.010> RX<00:05:28.880> and

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
here user name / 4x4 replace the RX and

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:38.540 
here user name / 4x4 replace the RX and
divine<00:05:29.360> mode<00:05:29.600> first

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.400 

and<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:39.270> already<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.660> in<00:05:39.810> buying<00:05:40.020> mode<00:05:40.199> so<00:05:40.349> I'm

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
and it already is in buying mode so I'm

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.040 
and it already is in buying mode so I'm
going<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.560> select<00:05:40.680> bind<00:05:41.900> hopefully<00:05:42.900> what's

going to select bind hopefully what's

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.290 
going to select bind hopefully what's
going<00:05:43.169> to<00:05:43.229> happen<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.560> we'll<00:05:43.710> see<00:05:43.889> this<00:05:44.300> you

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
going to happen is we'll see this you

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.779 
going to happen is we'll see this you
actually<00:05:45.419> see<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.900> flashing<00:05:46.410> changing<00:05:47.009> if<00:05:47.699> I

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
actually see the flashing changing if I

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.330 
actually see the flashing changing if I
get<00:05:47.970> out<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.180> way<00:05:48.270> here<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:50.130> we<00:05:50.220> have

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
get out of the way here and we have

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.390 
get out of the way here and we have
control<00:05:50.699> just<00:05:51.060> like<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.949> let's<00:05:52.949> back<00:05:53.160> out<00:05:53.340> of

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
control just like that let's back out of

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.610 
control just like that let's back out of
this

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.150 

I<00:06:00.710> should<00:06:01.340> be<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.460> steer<00:06:01.760> look<00:06:02.479> at<00:06:02.570> that<00:06:05.979> we<00:06:06.979> got

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
I should be a steer look at that we got

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.570 
I should be a steer look at that we got
acceleration<00:06:08.050> we<00:06:09.050> got<00:06:09.229> reverse<00:06:09.530> and<00:06:10.040> we<00:06:10.430> got

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
acceleration we got reverse and we got

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.460 
acceleration we got reverse and we got
steering<00:06:10.850> so<00:06:11.120> that's<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.479> so<00:06:11.960> let's<00:06:12.169> do<00:06:12.320> it

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
steering so that's it so let's do it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.320 
steering so that's it so let's do it
it's<00:06:13.100> all<00:06:13.190> bound<00:06:13.400> up<00:06:13.639> and<00:06:13.729> ready<00:06:13.910> to<00:06:14.000> go<00:06:14.150> now

it's all bound up and ready to go now

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.210 
it's all bound up and ready to go now
I'm<00:06:14.419> going<00:06:14.570> to<00:06:14.630> seal<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:14.960> up<00:06:15.139> connect<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.130> all

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
I'm going to seal this up connect it all

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.150 
I'm going to seal this up connect it all
back<00:06:16.520> up<00:06:16.720> run<00:06:17.720> this<00:06:18.380> back<00:06:18.680> through<00:06:18.710> the

see I've sealed everything back up one
thing<00:06:27.919> I<00:06:28.010> didn't<00:06:28.220> mention<00:06:28.280> before<00:06:28.550> is<00:06:28.820> after

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
thing I didn't mention before is after

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.870 
thing I didn't mention before is after
you've<00:06:29.300> found<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:30.199> actual<00:06:31.160> receiver<00:06:31.639> you<00:06:31.850> can

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
you've found the actual receiver you can

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.740 
you've found the actual receiver you can
go<00:06:32.120> ahead<00:06:32.210> and<00:06:32.389> remove<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:36.669> binding<00:06:37.669> plug<00:06:37.910> so

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
go ahead and remove the binding plug so

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.800 
go ahead and remove the binding plug so
before<00:06:39.380> you<00:06:39.470> use<00:06:39.680> it<00:06:39.940> remove<00:06:40.940> that<00:06:41.120> stort<00:06:41.690> in<00:06:41.780> a

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
before you use it remove that stort in a

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.529 
before you use it remove that stort in a
safe<00:06:41.960> place<00:06:42.110> if<00:06:42.470> you<00:06:42.590> ever<00:06:42.710> want<00:06:42.919> to<00:06:43.010> bind<00:06:43.190> more

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
safe place if you ever want to bind more

safe place if you ever want to bind more
receivers<00:06:44.539> they'll<00:06:44.840> probably<00:06:45.020> typically

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
receivers they'll probably typically

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.860

come<00:06:45.860> with<00:06:45.889> them<00:06:46.160> when<00:06:46.280> you<00:06:46.340> buy<00:06:46.520> them<00:06:46.669> but<00:06:47.570> as

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
come with them when you buy them but as

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.510

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
you can see I've sealed it all back up

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.330 
you can see I've sealed it all back up

actually want it to remain water proof
you'll<00:06:57.440> take<00:06:57.680> your<00:06:57.830> time<00:06:58.039> reinstalling<00:06:58.699> all

you'll take your time reinstalling all
this<00:06:59.180> and<00:06:59.419> making<00:06:59.600> sure<00:06:59.720> it's<00:06:59.870> all<00:06:59.960> tight<00:07:00.289> and

this and making sure it's all tight and

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.909 
this and making sure it's all tight and
sealed<00:07:00.919> I<00:07:01.160> used<00:07:02.060> a<00:07:02.210> little<00:07:02.419> piece<00:07:02.600> of

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
sealed I used a little piece of

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.360 
sealed I used a little piece of
double-sided<00:07:03.919> like<00:07:04.520> that<00:07:04.940> felt<00:07:06.099> like<00:07:07.099> stuff

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
double-sided like that felt like stuff

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.460 
double-sided like that felt like stuff
you<00:07:07.520> can<00:07:07.669> get<00:07:07.760> from<00:07:08.030> like<00:07:08.660> office<00:07:09.020> mix<00:07:09.200> or<00:07:09.349> like

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
you can get from like office mix or like

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.950 
you can get from like office mix or like
little<00:07:09.680> paths<00:07:09.979> to<00:07:10.880> secure<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.479> receiver

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
little paths to secure the receiver

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.330 
little paths to secure the receiver
inside<00:07:12.320> the<00:07:12.410> receiver<00:07:12.740> box<00:07:12.860> because<00:07:13.130> the<00:07:13.220> new

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
inside the receiver box because the new

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.750 
inside the receiver box because the new
one<00:07:13.490> was<00:07:13.580> actually<00:07:13.700> a<00:07:13.880> lot<00:07:14.030> smaller<00:07:14.389> than<00:07:14.630> this

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
one was actually a lot smaller than this

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.270 
one was actually a lot smaller than this
Gigantor<00:07:17.139> tracks<00:07:18.139> this<00:07:18.289> one<00:07:18.530> they<00:07:19.130> have<00:07:19.160> a

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
Gigantor tracks this one they have a

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.650 
Gigantor tracks this one they have a
similar<00:07:19.580> thing<00:07:19.820> on<00:07:19.910> the<00:07:20.000> back<00:07:20.150> you<00:07:20.330> can<00:07:20.389> kind

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
similar thing on the back you can kind

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.960 
similar thing on the back you can kind
of<00:07:20.720> see<00:07:20.870> a<00:07:20.900> little<00:07:21.080> of<00:07:21.260> the<00:07:21.669> remnants<00:07:22.669> left<00:07:22.729> I

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
of see a little of the remnants left I

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.570 
of see a little of the remnants left I
just<00:07:23.180> kind<00:07:23.389> of<00:07:23.450> reuse<00:07:23.690> that<00:07:24.070> so<00:07:25.070> that's<00:07:25.430> how

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
just kind of reuse that so that's how

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.020 
just kind of reuse that so that's how
you<00:07:25.639> bind<00:07:25.940> as<00:07:26.570> you<00:07:26.690> can<00:07:26.810> see<00:07:27.020> so<00:07:27.530> it<00:07:27.620> works<00:07:28.030> and

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
you bind as you can see so it works and

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.210 
you bind as you can see so it works and
now<00:07:29.660> I<00:07:29.690> combine<00:07:30.020> multiple<00:07:30.349> miles<00:07:30.770> of<00:07:30.979> the<00:07:31.039> same

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.220 
now I combine multiple miles of the same

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.580 
now I combine multiple miles of the same
controller<00:07:31.610> and<00:07:31.940> no<00:07:32.870> matter<00:07:33.050> what<00:07:33.260> you've<00:07:33.410> got

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
controller and no matter what you've got

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.570 
controller and no matter what you've got
electric<00:07:34.099> nitro<00:07:34.460> truck<00:07:34.880> car<00:07:35.180> charger<00:07:35.900> buggy

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580 
electric nitro truck car charger buggy

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.339 
electric nitro truck car charger buggy
the<00:07:37.580> process<00:07:38.000> is<00:07:38.150> really<00:07:38.449> almost<00:07:38.690> exactly<00:07:39.229> the

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:39.349 
the process is really almost exactly the

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:44.740 
the process is really almost exactly the
same<00:07:40.360> basically<00:07:42.910> put<00:07:43.910> the<00:07:44.030> bind<00:07:44.240> plug<00:07:44.510> in<00:07:44.660> the

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
same basically put the bind plug in the

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.010 
same basically put the bind plug in the
receiver<00:07:46.000> turn<00:07:47.000> on<00:07:47.180> the<00:07:47.330> receiver<00:07:47.690> so<00:07:47.960> it

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
receiver turn on the receiver so it

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.129 
receiver turn on the receiver so it
starts<00:07:48.260> looking<00:07:48.530> for<00:07:48.710> a<00:07:48.740> signal<00:07:49.270> then<00:07:50.270> turn<00:07:50.990> on

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:51.139 
starts looking for a signal then turn on

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.250 
starts looking for a signal then turn on
your<00:07:51.169> remote<00:07:52.010> and<00:07:52.539> whatever<00:07:53.539> remote<00:07:54.050> you<00:07:54.229> have

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:54.260 
your remote and whatever remote you have

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.170 
your remote and whatever remote you have
it's<00:07:54.860> going<00:07:55.010> to<00:07:55.070> have<00:07:55.190> some<00:07:55.460> bind<00:07:55.910> button

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180 
it's going to have some bind button

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.670 
it's going to have some bind button
maybe<00:07:56.389> this<00:07:56.539> little<00:07:56.660> push<00:07:57.110> button<00:07:57.289> you<00:07:57.440> got<00:07:57.560> to

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 
maybe this little push button you got to

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.409 
maybe this little push button you got to
use<00:07:57.800> the<00:07:57.830> body<00:07:58.099> clip<00:07:58.340> to<00:07:58.460> push<00:07:58.610> down<00:07:58.820> or

00:07:59.409 --> 00:07:59.419 
use the body clip to push down or

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:02.140 
use the body clip to push down or
whatever<00:07:59.570> that's<00:08:00.349> really<00:08:00.650> it<00:08:00.800> so<00:08:01.280> if<00:08:01.940> you<00:08:02.060> have

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.150 
whatever that's really it so if you have

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.830 
whatever that's really it so if you have
