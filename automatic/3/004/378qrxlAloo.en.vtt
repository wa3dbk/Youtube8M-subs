here<00:00:02.070> in<00:00:02.190> denmark<00:00:02.550> what<00:00:03.030> went<00:00:03.210> wrong<00:00:03.330> for<00:00:03.510> your

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
here in denmark what went wrong for your

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.070 
here in denmark what went wrong for your
side<00:00:03.810> this<00:00:03.959> evening<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.850> think<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.000> play<00:00:06.899> well

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
side this evening I think we play well

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.430 
side this evening I think we play well
we<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.970> we<00:00:08.970> had<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> good<00:00:09.540> start<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> game<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
we we we had a good start in the game I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.549 
we we we had a good start in the game I
think<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.610> were<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.790> better<00:00:12.030> team<00:00:12.440> we<00:00:13.440> had

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
think we were the better team we had

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.930 
think we were the better team we had
some<00:00:13.740> good<00:00:13.889> chances<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> first<00:00:14.730> 15

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
some good chances in the first 15

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.490 
some good chances in the first 15
minutes<00:00:15.330> maybe<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.500> clinical<00:00:16.980> enough<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
minutes maybe not clinical enough and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.640 
minutes maybe not clinical enough and
okay<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.710> mistake<00:00:20.449> makes<00:00:21.449> 1<00:00:21.689> nil<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.080> then

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
okay one mistake makes 1 nil and then

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.740 
okay one mistake makes 1 nil and then
you<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:24.180> will<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:24.720> difficult

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you know it will be more difficult

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
you know it will be more difficult
because<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.830> will<00:00:25.980> again<00:00:26.730> play<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.689> what

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
because they will again play like what

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.970 
because they will again play like what
they<00:00:28.260> did<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> team<00:00:31.619> was

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
they did but I think the team was

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.350 
they did but I think the team was
working<00:00:32.160> hard<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> team<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.090> trying

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
working hard the team was trying

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
working hard the team was trying
everything<00:00:33.719> second<00:00:34.320> half<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.940> then

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
everything second half and then

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
everything second half and then
sometimes<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> need<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
sometimes you need a little bit to be a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.200 
sometimes you need a little bit to be a
little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.489> luck<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.410> opinion

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
little bit luck because in my opinion

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.819 
little bit luck because in my opinion
both<00:00:42.210> referees<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.050> roughly<00:00:43.290> last<00:00:43.590> week

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
both referees there roughly last week

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.240 
both referees there roughly last week
and<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.760> referee<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> today<00:00:45.890> had<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> big

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and the referee of today had a big

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.900 
and the referee of today had a big
influence<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> final<00:00:48.450> result<00:00:48.890> because<00:00:49.910> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
influence in the final result because we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.200 
influence in the final result because we
scored<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> normal<00:00:51.629> call<00:00:51.809> last<00:00:52.050> week<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.210> it's

on<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.070> good<00:02:13.990> good<00:02:14.990> level<00:02:15.470> makes<00:02:15.790> they<00:02:16.790> came<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
on a good good level makes they came a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.830 
on a good good level makes they came a
little<00:02:17.240> bit<00:02:17.450> different<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.620> crisis<00:02:19.040> was

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
little bit different but the crisis was

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.810 
little bit different but the crisis was
always<00:02:20.840> one<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.470> defenders<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.580> and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
always one of the defenders and and and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.930 
always one of the defenders and and and
the<00:02:23.210> second<00:02:23.600> ball<00:02:24.160> went<00:02:25.160> always<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.730> them

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
