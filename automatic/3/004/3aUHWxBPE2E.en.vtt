00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
USA Today and this is what they said was

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.400 
USA Today and this is what they said was
the<00:01:11.460> actual<00:01:11.850> usage<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> internet<00:01:13.290> and

the actual usage for the internet and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.190 
the actual usage for the internet and
they<00:01:14.100> said<00:01:14.790> reading<00:01:15.119> email<00:01:15.360> 32<00:01:15.720> tons<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.050> time

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
they said reading email 32 tons of time

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
they said reading email 32 tons of time
working<00:01:16.860> twenty<00:01:17.550> two<00:01:17.640> percent<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.000> time

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
working twenty two percent of the time

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
working twenty two percent of the time
shopping<00:01:18.630> 16<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> looked<00:01:19.410> at<00:01:19.530> these

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
shopping 16 and I looked at these

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
shopping 16 and I looked at these
numbers<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.090> theoretically<00:01:21.960> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
numbers and I think theoretically this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.270 
numbers and I think theoretically this
is<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
is what they would like it to be but I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.680 
is what they would like it to be but I
don't<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.700> even<00:01:23.790> close<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
don't think that's even close to the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.450 
don't think that's even close to the
truth<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.200> figured<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> numbers<00:01:26.190> are<00:01:26.340> correct

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
truth I figured the numbers are correct

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.680 
truth I figured the numbers are correct
but<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.790> would<00:01:27.000> real<00:01:27.149> able<00:01:27.390> him<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.660> I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
but I would real able him the way I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.139 
but I would real able him the way I
think<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.410> so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.970> one

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
think it really is so I did I think one

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.400 
think it really is so I did I think one
percent<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> time<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.050> spent

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
percent of the time is actually spent

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.270 
percent of the time is actually spent
working<00:01:33.440> think<00:01:34.440> five<00:01:34.649> percent<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.160> time

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
working think five percent of the time

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.530 
working think five percent of the time
is<00:01:35.490> spent<00:01:35.850> trying<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.240> remember<00:01:36.390> passwords

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and there's a guy already standing at a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.220 
and there's a guy already standing at a
urinal<00:02:51.220> we're<00:02:52.209> immediately<00:02:52.720> faced<00:02:52.959> with<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
urinal we're immediately faced with the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.060 
urinal we're immediately faced with the
question<00:02:53.260> which<00:02:54.070> urinal<00:02:54.610> do<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.850> go<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:59.070> and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
question which urinal do we go to and

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.350 
question which urinal do we go to and
really<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.400> put<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.730> thought<00:03:00.970> into<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
really I put some thought into this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.580 
really I put some thought into this
because<00:03:01.480> I've<00:03:01.720> asked<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.019> lot<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.260> guys<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
because I've asked a lot of guys and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.140 
because I've asked a lot of guys and
most<00:03:02.830> guys<00:03:03.070> saying<00:03:03.370> I've<00:03:03.519> done<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> little

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
most guys saying I've done a little

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000 
most guys saying I've done a little
engineering<00:03:04.660> analysis<00:03:05.049> most<00:03:05.560> guys<00:03:05.769> say<00:03:05.799> you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
engineering analysis most guys say you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.289 
engineering analysis most guys say you
should<00:03:06.220> go<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.820> solution<00:03:07.239> number

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
should go here so that solution number

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.750 
should go here so that solution number
one<00:03:07.680> now<00:03:08.680> let's<00:03:08.860> look<00:03:09.010> at<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.489> second

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
one now let's look at that for a second

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.250 
one now let's look at that for a second
I<00:03:09.880> think<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.269> solution<00:03:10.840> under<00:03:11.049> analysis

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
I think that solution under analysis

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.440 
I think that solution under analysis
actually<00:03:11.950> that's<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.280> that's<00:03:12.610> too<00:03:12.820> far<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
actually that's it that's too far that

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.789 
actually that's it that's too far that
sends<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.780> message<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.290> other<00:03:14.380> guy<00:03:14.620> man

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
sends a message to that other guy man

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.539 
sends a message to that other guy man
you<00:03:15.100> look<00:03:15.280> weird<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:17.530> staying<00:03:17.890> way<00:03:18.130> far<00:03:18.430> away

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
you look weird I'm staying way far away

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.479 
you look weird I'm staying way far away
from<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.500> that's<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.590> little<00:03:20.799> insulting<00:03:21.040> on

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
from you that's a little insulting on

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.039 
from you that's a little insulting on
the<00:03:21.610> other<00:03:21.700> hand<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.269> don't<00:03:22.329> want<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.600> go<00:03:22.690> here

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
the other hand you don't want to go here

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.960 
the other hand you don't want to go here
cuz<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.709> sends<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.010> message<00:03:24.370> hey<00:03:24.549> man<00:03:24.730> I'm

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
cuz that sends a message hey man I'm

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.500 
cuz that sends a message hey man I'm
weird

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
weird

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.750 
weird
hi<00:03:28.450> I'm<00:03:29.450> extent<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:33.129> in<00:03:34.129> my<00:03:34.280> analysis

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
hi I'm extent so I think in my analysis

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.190 
hi I'm extent so I think in my analysis
I<00:03:34.849> think<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.060> best<00:03:35.269> solution<00:03:35.329> is<00:03:35.659> to<00:03:35.750> go<00:03:35.900> there

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
I think the best solution is to go there

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.140 
I think the best solution is to go there
because<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.159> good<00:03:37.459> spacing<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:37.970> there's

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
because that's good spacing and there's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.710 
because that's good spacing and there's
plenty<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.390> room<00:03:38.450> for<00:03:38.569> guy<00:03:38.810> number<00:03:38.989> three<00:03:39.110> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
plenty of room for guy number three and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.940 
plenty of room for guy number three and
then<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> fourth<00:03:42.049> guy<00:03:42.230> has<00:03:42.439> to<00:03:42.560> choose<00:03:42.739> which

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
then the fourth guy has to choose which

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.490 
then the fourth guy has to choose which
two<00:03:43.129> guys<00:03:43.310> he<00:03:43.519> likes<00:03:43.670> better<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:47.379> then<00:03:48.379> I

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
two guys he likes better and then I

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.960 
two guys he likes better and then I
think<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.829> absolute<00:03:48.950> worst<00:03:49.459> solution<00:03:49.849> would

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
think the absolute worst solution would

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.140 
think the absolute worst solution would
be<00:03:50.030> there<00:03:54.310> hello<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.519> gotta<00:03:55.790> say<00:03:55.970> I've<00:03:56.090> always

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
be there hello I gotta say I've always

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.539 
be there hello I gotta say I've always
wanted<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.599> try<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:57.019> got<00:03:57.260> hey<00:03:58.189> how<00:03:58.489> you
