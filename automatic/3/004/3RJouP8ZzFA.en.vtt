00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
about you've got the pad on one side and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.410 
about you've got the pad on one side and
the<00:00:46.920> case<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> other<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.239> exactly

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the case on the other and that's exactly

then on the other side is the pad and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.149 
then on the other side is the pad and
charger<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> comes<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.989> power<00:01:03.989> cable

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.880 

an<00:01:08.159> instruction<00:01:08.939> manual<00:01:09.650> tells<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> all

an instruction manual tells you all
about<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.869> then<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.380> pad<00:01:13.950> itself<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:15.570> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the hand let's get to the four of you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.090 
the hand let's get to the four of you
now<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> before<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> charging

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
now so before we get to the charging

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
now so before we get to the charging
side<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.549> things<00:01:32.670> let's<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.210> take<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> look

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
side of things let's first take a look

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
side of things let's first take a look
at<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> case<00:01:34.020> itself<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.890> two-piece

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
at the case itself it is a two-piece

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.080 
at the case itself it is a two-piece
case<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.390> slides<00:01:36.990> together<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.490> guess

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
case that slides together in a I guess

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
case that slides together in a I guess
slider<00:01:39.479> style<00:01:39.869> fashion<00:01:40.170> similar<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
slider style fashion similar to the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
slider style fashion similar to the
mophie<00:01:41.729> juice<00:01:41.759> pack<00:01:41.970> air<00:01:42.329> everything<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
know as far as the guts of the device

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
know as far as the guts of the device
are<00:01:45.180> housed<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> bottom<00:01:46.560> portion<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
are housed in the bottom portion of the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.289 
are housed in the bottom portion of the
case<00:01:47.280> including<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> part<00:01:48.119> where<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
case including the part where you

actually connect your iPhone and then

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
actually connect your iPhone and then
the<00:01:50.159> top<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> serves<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.960> lock

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the top just kind of serves to lock

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
the top just kind of serves to lock
everything<00:01:52.439> together<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.700> protect

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
everything together as well as protect
