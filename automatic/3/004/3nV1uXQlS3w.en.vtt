 stanislav beetles and author unique 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.160
 system physical dos channels nelyubin and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.349
 beloyar about your system author beloyar 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 told us on the birch of the black sea you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.150
 about the waters in training themselves on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.490
 Beloyar system is an ancient very ancient 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 Slavic culture 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.810
 Old Slavic technique that was 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 collected first of course 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 all studied and yoga and comfort there too 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 quando martial arts are different and we 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 saw that single grain which is everywhere 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.969
 that's where traced came to our 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.430
 were we turned out to be pancakes it's all there 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.649
 that is , our magnetic power 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 heroes who are now described as 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.469
 the fairy tale was not a fairy tale but the problem 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 it was that all modern 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.950
 processes suggest that muscle can 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.920
 job kv-2 state of stress 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.430
 melted we found the third state 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.160
 muscles and stretched elongated not tendons 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.719
 stretched muscle then stretch these 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.000
 here are the effects that you just showed 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 people literally you just came 30 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.830
 seconds of explanation they are already such things 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.010
 start where and here our ancestors knew 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.420
 it has always been our culture 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 physical education 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 now there is a fizra here we thank God 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.590
 For 20 years it cultivated the rose 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 summed up the material base of medicine 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.920
 received a patent and received certificates 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.110
 have already received 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 from medicine good in russia already doing 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.390
 sanatoriums in this case here already 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.790
 begin to engage in nature thank God 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.100
 here we go we give to the masses to the people 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.289
 wellness trainers to work 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.979
 the effect of all our ancestors did not hurt 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.240
 never hurt one by one 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.850
 the simple reason is that when 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.229
 brains work well then all 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.229
 peripherals work very 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.960
 qualitatively due to the stretch strongly 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.460
 stretches we restore through micro 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.259
 muscular system restoring work 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.819
 central nervous system she 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.330
 controls all peripheral 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.690
 devices 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.280
 during this time now in the woods of the cat 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.400
 in kazakhstan there is also a system 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.319
 cultivated and very successful 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.730
 have worked even already passed and got 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.950
 such colossal results that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.860
 medicine just got up because such 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.299
 asthmatics scoliosis niki 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.170
 cardiovascular diseases sugar 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.760
 diabetes mental retardation 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 generally elementary surge as limit 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.570
 she will have to work this is not a freebie this 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.579
 don't have to work hard 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.530
 hard enough some 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.329
 exercise is painful enough we 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.329
 then such pleasure is such a joy 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.880
 from the movement it turns out this such 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.799
 life pleasure becomes what 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.900
 people are so happy out of work 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.859
 after that they can still for at least a whole 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.079
 day and after normal physical education tired 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:56.500
 we conducted an anapa experiment in the past 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.660
 year with athletes worked after their 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.820
 workouts did the body diagnosis 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.890
 just went to zero right there was ours 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.100
 the training itself is also quite strong 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.350
 the body has completely stopped due to 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.540
 which was awarded in Germany 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.489
 honorary cross of the crown received for 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.069
 creating a system in france got 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.140
 medal ladder for creating a system well and 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.150
 our academy of sciences vitalgal before neither 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.069
 cool you something like they dwelled here 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.470
 Kind of like ok now medicine 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.470
 well and the results are generally lower lane
