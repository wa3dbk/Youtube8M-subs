00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.310 
can see nobody follows them so you make
the<00:01:44.330> pass<00:01:44.510> right<00:01:44.810> there<00:01:45.070> get<00:01:46.070> an<00:01:46.190> easy<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:48.200> is

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the pass right there get an easy what is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.640 
the pass right there get an easy what is
that<00:01:48.530> about<00:01:49.310> 10<00:01:49.700> 15<00:01:49.910> yards<00:01:50.540> just<00:01:50.660> off<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.350> that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
that about 10 15 yards just off of that

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:04.800 
that about 10 15 yards just off of that
little<00:01:52.640> pass<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.900> flats

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.410 

now<00:02:05.810> as<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:07.310> as<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.730> can<00:02:07.850> see<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
now as you as you can see this is a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.220 
now as you as you can see this is a
baseline<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:11.450> could<00:02:11.600> do<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> right

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
baseline you could do it on the right

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.370 
baseline you could do it on the right
side<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.490> not<00:02:14.000> based<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.900> line<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.320> you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
side but it's not based on line so you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.170 
side but it's not based on line so you
see<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.160> guy<00:02:16.400> playing<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.790> flat<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
see that the guy playing the flat is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.540 
see that the guy playing the flat is
gonna<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.480> playing<00:02:17.720> out<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> right<00:02:19.310> side

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
gonna be playing out to the right side

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.010 
gonna be playing out to the right side
of<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> ball<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.390> want<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
of the ball so you want to go to the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.160 
of the ball so you want to go to the
left<00:02:21.260> side<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:23.390> again<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.630> make<00:02:24.020> that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
left side here so again just make that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.750 
left side here so again just make that
initial<00:02:24.620> read<00:02:25.070> easy<00:02:26.060> are<00:02:26.450> tidge<00:02:27.370> mix<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.550> in

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
initial read easy are tidge mix this in

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.970 
initial read easy are tidge mix this in
with<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.940> run<00:02:29.209> some<00:02:29.630> other<00:02:29.780> pass<00:02:30.050> plays<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.830> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
with a run some other pass plays you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.270 
with a run some other pass plays you can
form<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.459> scheme<00:02:31.730> around<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:32.709> this<00:02:33.709> even<00:02:34.100> works

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
form a scheme around it this even works

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.670 
form a scheme around it this even works
against<00:02:34.700> cover<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.510> defense

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.440 

you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.910 

you<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.959> flat<00:02:46.260> would<00:02:46.439> play<00:02:46.680> that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you think that that flat would play that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
you think that that flat would play that
but<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.519> gonna<00:02:47.670> play<00:02:47.909> up<00:02:48.840> filled<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.409> little

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
but it's gonna play up filled a little

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.610 
but it's gonna play up filled a little
bit<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:51.269> allow<00:02:52.400> you're<00:02:53.400> tied<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.939> make<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
bit and allow you're tied in to make the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.679 
bit and allow you're tied in to make the
catch<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.890> that

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
catch on that

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.940 
catch on that
also<00:02:57.689> since<00:02:58.290> user<00:02:59.120> catching<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.299> computer

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
also since user catching or computer

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.920 
also since user catching or computer
assisted<00:03:01.950> user<00:03:02.190> catching<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.480> easy<00:03:03.690> this

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
assisted user catching is so easy this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.339 
assisted user catching is so easy this
year<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.430> stock<00:03:05.819> fades<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.599> the

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
year you got the stock fades on the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.069 
year you got the stock fades on the
outside<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:08.220> she<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.610> throw<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.750> was<00:03:10.049> a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
outside that she can throw to I was a

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:20.149 
outside that she can throw to I was a
pretty<00:03:10.650> bad<00:03:10.829> throw<00:03:11.159> there<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.859> going<00:03:20.099> to

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
pretty bad throw there but it's going to

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.710 
pretty bad throw there but it's going to
be<00:03:20.310> there<00:03:22.879> man<00:03:23.879> and<00:03:24.209> one<00:03:24.389> thing<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.659> guys

gotta watch for this year and the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.449 
gotta watch for this year and the
quarterbacks<00:03:28.049> just<00:03:28.349> make<00:03:28.530> random<00:03:28.799> terrible

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
quarterbacks just make random terrible

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.720

throws<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.700> things

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
throws that's really one of the things

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.110 
throws that's really one of the things
that<00:03:36.200> bothers<00:03:37.200> me<00:03:37.230> about<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.370> year's<00:03:38.609> game<00:03:38.879> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that bothers me about this year's game a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.599 
that bothers me about this year's game a
little<00:03:39.359> bit<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.040> fact<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
little bit is the fact that the

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.410 
little bit is the fact that the
quarterback<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.349> people<00:03:43.349> can<00:03:43.560> throw<00:03:44.090> 40<00:03:45.090> 50

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420
