00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
at the beginning of other games because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.090 
at the beginning of other games because
the<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.500> only<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.890> beat<00:00:44.070> any

games<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.480> keep<00:00:46.140> switching

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
games all you do is just keep switching

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
games all you do is just keep switching
back<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> forth<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.340> between<00:00:47.640> classes<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
back and forth in between classes and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
back and forth in between classes and
planting<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.440> reason<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
planting them the reason you have to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
planting them the reason you have to
have<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.430> different<00:00:50.700> classes<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
have the two different classes like this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
have the two different classes like this
is<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> kept<00:00:52.980> clicking<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.640> same

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
is because if you kept clicking the same

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.990 
is because if you kept clicking the same
like<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.620> primary<00:00:56.160> shell<00:00:56.399> assault

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
like you had two primary shell assault

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.430 
like you had two primary shell assault
shield<00:00:57.149> classes<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.199> keep

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
shield classes they would just keep

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.569 
shield classes they would just keep
cancelling<00:00:58.920> each<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.460> would

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
cancelling each other out and they would

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.290 
cancelling each other out and they would
just<00:00:59.609> disappear<00:01:00.350> that's<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.530> happens<00:01:02.300> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
just disappear that's what happens and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
just disappear that's what happens and
so<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> glitch<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so all you have to do for this glitch to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
so all you have to do for this glitch to
work<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> planter

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
work is you just just as a planter

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
work is you just just as a planter
eyeshield<00:01:07.590> step<00:01:07.950> away<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:08.520> one

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
or whatnot and you can you get it like I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
or whatnot and you can you get it like I
don't<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.119> 20<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.630> 30<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.290> depends

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
don't know 20 to 30 down it just depends

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.499 
don't know 20 to 30 down it just depends
on<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> guys<00:01:38.400> spread<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.820> because

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
on how well you guys spread out because

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.580 
on how well you guys spread out because
through<00:01:39.659> too<00:01:39.840> close<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> each<00:01:40.259> other<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
through too close to each other you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
through too close to each other you
can't<00:01:40.829> plant<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.579> slows<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
can't plant them and then that slows it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.780 
can't plant them and then that slows it
down<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> run<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
down and then you run out of time and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
down and then you run out of time and
what<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> usually<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.750> plant<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.229> 50

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
what I usually do is I plant like 50

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700 
what I usually do is I plant like 50
more<00:01:47.189> six<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> them<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.840> switch<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.470> class

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
more six of them and I switch to a class

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.130 
more six of them and I switch to a class
where<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> primary<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.909> any<00:01:51.780> primary

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
where I have a primary on any primary

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
where I have a primary on any primary
and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.340> shields

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and then you just put this all shields

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280 
and then you just put this all shields
in<00:01:53.729> secondary<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.840> replant<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
in secondary so you can replant that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
in secondary so you can replant that
secondary<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.640> replant<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> riot

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
secondary or you can replant that riot

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
secondary or you can replant that riot
shield<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> primary

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
shield and then you can have a primary

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.819 
shield and then you can have a primary
to<00:01:59.759> shoot<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.060> people<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.680> good
