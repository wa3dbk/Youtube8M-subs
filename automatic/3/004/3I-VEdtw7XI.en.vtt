enough<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:10.410> really<00:04:10.709> justify<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.310> conversion

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
enough to really justify the conversion

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.360 
enough to really justify the conversion
rate<00:04:12.270> because<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.570> know<00:04:12.920> they<00:04:13.920> were<00:04:13.980> talking

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
but it's not that easy because you need

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.729 
but it's not that easy because you need
a<00:04:18.270> lot<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.660> money

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
to really make it work in the conversion

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.210 
to really make it work in the conversion
rate<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:24.319> maybe<00:04:25.319> someone's<00:04:25.620> found<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.979> much<00:04:26.099> I
