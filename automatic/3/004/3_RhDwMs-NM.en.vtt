00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.540 
really easy as a coach when you're
trying<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.500> instruct<00:01:35.860> them<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.310> they're

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
trying to instruct them and they're

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.670 
trying to instruct them and they're
trying<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.850> get<00:01:37.030> what<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.300> need<00:01:37.450> fixed<00:01:37.840> got

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
trying to get what you need fixed got

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.260 
trying to get what you need fixed got
coach<00:01:38.920> Brewer<00:01:39.190> they<00:01:39.340> recruited<00:01:39.820> me<00:01:39.850> that's<00:01:40.120> my

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
coach Brewer they recruited me that's my

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.800 
coach Brewer they recruited me that's my
name's<00:01:40.420> okay<00:01:40.690> put<00:01:41.410> me<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.650> offensive<00:01:41.950> side

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
name's okay put me on the offensive side

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.750 
name's okay put me on the offensive side
but<00:01:43.810> uh<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.380> think<00:01:44.620> it's<00:01:44.860> been<00:01:44.980> more<00:01:45.130> intense

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
but uh I think it's been more intense

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.820 
but uh I think it's been more intense
like<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.659> said<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:46.960> meant<00:01:47.140> more<00:01:47.290> focus<00:01:47.740> on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
like I said it's meant more focus on

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.190 
like I said it's meant more focus on
details<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.150> they<00:01:49.570> want<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.810> make<00:01:49.930> sure<00:01:49.960> we

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
details and so they want to make sure we

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.480 
details and so they want to make sure we
know<00:01:50.320> what<00:01:50.560> we're<00:01:50.710> doing<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.100> why<00:01:51.310> we're

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
know what we're doing and why we're

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.680 
know what we're doing and why we're
doing<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.820> instead<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.120> just<00:01:52.210> going<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.659> there

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
doing it instead of just going out there

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.210 
doing it instead of just going out there
and<00:01:52.870> playing<00:01:52.960> they're<00:01:53.620> really<00:01:53.740> making<00:01:53.950> us

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
and playing they're really making us

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.550 
and playing they're really making us
students<00:01:54.550> incident<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.000> game<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.080> feel

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
students incident in the game so I feel

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.899 
students incident in the game so I feel
like<00:01:56.590> we've<00:01:56.860> learned<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.159> lot<00:01:57.310> about<00:01:57.550> football

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
like we've learned a lot about football

like we've learned a lot about football
this<00:01:58.240> year<00:01:58.300> more<00:01:58.600> than<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.900> about<00:01:59.020> playing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
this year more than just about playing

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.860 
this year more than just about playing
learning<00:02:00.159> kind<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.000> scheme<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:01.600> mean

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
learning kind of the scheme to I mean

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.360 
learning kind of the scheme to I mean
it's<00:02:01.990> it's<00:02:02.200> new<00:02:02.409> it's<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.680> transition<00:02:03.220> how's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
it's it's new it's a transition how's

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.880 
it's it's new it's a transition how's
the<00:02:03.580> scheme<00:02:03.760> adjustment<00:02:04.210> there<00:02:04.330> man<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.650> skis

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
the scheme adjustment there man the skis

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.410 
the scheme adjustment there man the skis
been<00:02:06.100> different<00:02:06.490> everybody<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.210> don't<00:02:07.330> have

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
been different everybody you don't have

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.389 
been different everybody you don't have
to<00:02:07.510> run<00:02:07.659> all<00:02:07.690> over<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.109> field<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.560> you're

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
to run all over the field you you're

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
to run all over the field you you're
kind<00:02:09.579> of<00:02:09.609> stationary

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
kind of stationary

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
kind of stationary
you<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.310> lined<00:02:11.519> up<00:02:11.640> fast<00:02:11.909> and<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.209> allows<00:02:12.420> us

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
you get lined up fast and it allows us

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.009 
you get lined up fast and it allows us
to<00:02:12.719> play<00:02:12.900> faster<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:15.840> that's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that different this year I just think

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
we're gonna know what we're doing not

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.649 
we're gonna know what we're doing not
saying<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.579> we<00:02:35.670> didn't<00:02:35.939> last<00:02:36.060> year<00:02:36.299> but<00:02:36.450> I

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
saying that we didn't last year but I

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.750 
saying that we didn't last year but I
don't<00:02:36.900> things<00:02:37.049> gonna<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.290> nearly<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.760> minibus

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
don't things gonna be nearly as minibus

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.509 
don't things gonna be nearly as minibus
as<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.510> had<00:02:39.629> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> secondary<00:02:40.230> last<00:02:40.500> year<00:02:40.769> I

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
as we had in the secondary last year I

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.819 
as we had in the secondary last year I
think<00:02:42.120> everybody<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.540> more<00:02:42.689> keyed<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.169> and<00:02:43.439> we

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
think everybody is more keyed in and we

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.440 
think everybody is more keyed in and we
want<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.189> show<00:02:44.310> people<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.669> think<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.030> been<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
want to show people I think it's been a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.089 
want to show people I think it's been a
drought<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.109> North<00:02:46.290> Carolina<00:02:46.409> secondary

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
drought in North Carolina secondary

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.979 
drought in North Carolina secondary
which<00:02:47.250> has<00:02:47.400> been<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.819> good<00:02:48.180> secondary<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.840> put

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
which has been a good secondary to put

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.659 
which has been a good secondary to put
in<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.169> past<00:02:49.620> years<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.159> I<00:02:50.189> think<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.459> got<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
in the past years and I think we got to

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.280 
in the past years and I think we got to
bring<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.939> back<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.239> can't<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.569> say<00:02:51.750> we're

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
bring that back we can't just say we're

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
bring that back we can't just say we're
rude<00:02:52.470> boys<00:02:52.739> or<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.099> listen<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.609> we<00:02:53.819> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
rude boys or we listen to that we just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.520

grow throughout the season what's been

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.399 
grow throughout the season what's been
the<00:03:53.579> most<00:03:53.970> challenging<00:03:54.120> part<00:03:55.489> um<00:03:56.750> for<00:03:57.750> me<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
the most challenging part um for me the

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.219 
the most challenging part um for me the
detail<00:03:58.799> stuff<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.819> get<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.689> the<00:04:00.900> basic

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
detail stuff I get the the basic

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.990 
detail stuff I get the the basic
concepts<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.389> know

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
concepts but you know

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.350 
concepts but you know
the<00:04:04.480> different<00:04:04.840> run<00:04:04.960> fits<00:04:05.230> different<00:04:06.360> looks

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
the different run fits different looks

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.780 
the different run fits different looks
of<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.230> have<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> motion<00:04:08.620> or<00:04:08.950> your<00:04:09.310> when<00:04:09.700> you

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
of you have a motion or your when you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.400 
of you have a motion or your when you
have<00:04:09.880> pulling<00:04:10.180> guards<00:04:10.570> different<00:04:11.290> things

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
have pulling guards different things

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.470 
have pulling guards different things
like<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.970> require<00:04:12.970> me<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.180> think<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> little

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
like that require me to think a little

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.180 
like that require me to think a little
bit<00:04:13.630> more<00:04:13.810> when<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.470> think<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> little<00:04:14.890> more<00:04:15.070> I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
bit more when I think a little more I

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.860 
bit more when I think a little more I
play<00:04:15.640> Lucas<00:04:15.820> Luhr<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.359> that's<00:04:16.690> something

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
play Lucas Luhr so that's something

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.849 
play Lucas Luhr so that's something
that's<00:04:17.019> been<00:04:17.230> challenging<00:04:17.560> for<00:04:17.590> me<00:04:17.739> but

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
that's been challenging for me but

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.609 
that's been challenging for me but
that's<00:04:17.980> something<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.220> still<00:04:18.489> work
