00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.640
 Hello everyone and welcome you ever happen 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 to have albums and not to know 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 what to do if the answer is yes these 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.199
 donuts are just what it does 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.240
 for you 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.359
 let's see together how they prepare themselves 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 ingredients are six albums the 150 g of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.739
 greek white yogurt 100 grams milk 90 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.230
 grams of seed oil 260 grams of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.590
 flour 15 grams of instant yeast 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 30 grams pies in I reduce the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 200 g of melted cheese 150 g of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:57.829
 dried tomatoes make of clizia what 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.829
 mixing the egg whites with oil and milk 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.190
 they should not be fitted simply 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.190
 be magic but phone 7 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.119
 add the yogurt 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.770
 always working add some 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.770
 time to the fairy that I have already sieved 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.120
 this is always yeast already 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.120
 obviously raised 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.410
 finally, salt and pepper 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.930
 this is the basic dough you will now have 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.930
 add the chopped ingredients 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.380
 let's put it aside 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.100
 impregnable start by chopping a little 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.100
 the other 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.700
 I had to use the franchises they use 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.890
 as he talks to mix the ingredients 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.100
 so they don't fit together at the end of 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.100
 fleet 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.640
 you can also take a bar city 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.640
 piola vault and overlap them 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.019
 and the cheese already cut into cubes 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.019
 before 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.000
 now take the donut molds 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.960
 there is already a screamed before economic not 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 It happens 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.400
 with these things they should come out 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.360
 about 5 cm lines with a diameter of 12 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.360
 centimeters 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.080
 once all the molds have arrived and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.040
 bake them in a preheated oven at 180 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.040
 for about living 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.430
 these are the fine missions 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.200
 egg whites cooked and left to cool in 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:16.530
 so you can easily remove them 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.480
 from the molds the mixture of these 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.510
 donuts and very versatile you can 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.420
 use it as a base to prepare muffins or 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.940
 savory plum cakes and have fun creating 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.850
 different flavors and different combinations 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.750
 I don't know with vegetables with meats and cheeses 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.850
 away saying 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.100
