worse<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.670> just<00:01:00.760> have<00:01:00.880> to<00:01:01.030> be<00:01:01.120> careful

putting<00:01:01.630> them<00:01:01.810> on<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:01.960> think<00:01:02.350> that's<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:02.710> kind

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
putting them on I think that's what kind

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.770 
putting them on I think that's what kind
of<00:01:03.010> hurts<00:01:03.250> some<00:01:03.460> people<00:01:03.790> when<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.509> know<00:01:04.629> they

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
of hurts some people when you know they

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.359 
of hurts some people when you know they
were<00:01:04.839> just<00:01:05.080> maybe<00:01:05.439> they<00:01:05.590> didn't<00:01:05.860> realize<00:01:06.159> how

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
were just maybe they didn't realize how

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.399 
were just maybe they didn't realize how
to<00:01:06.430> put<00:01:06.670> these<00:01:06.789> on<00:01:06.969> the<00:01:07.119> correct<00:01:07.420> way<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:08.289> know

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
to put these on the correct way you know

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.499 
to put these on the correct way you know
you<00:01:08.469> want<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.829> loosen<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:09.549> laces<00:01:09.729> as<00:01:10.210> much<00:01:10.390> as

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
you want to loosen the laces as much as

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.099 
you want to loosen the laces as much as
you<00:01:10.600> can<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.710> create<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.329> wider<00:01:13.329> kind

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
you can so you can create a wider kind

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.510 
you can so you can create a wider kind
of<00:01:14.200> space<00:01:14.409> for<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.649> foot<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.100> slide<00:01:15.340> in

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
of space for your foot to slide in

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.889 
of space for your foot to slide in
because<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.999> know<00:01:16.119> your<00:01:16.299> heels<00:01:16.539> going

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
because you know your heels going

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.200 
because you know your heels going
against<00:01:17.289> this<00:01:17.859> part<00:01:18.189> back<00:01:18.369> here<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.969> you<00:01:19.090> know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
against this part back here and you know

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.789 
against this part back here and you know
you<00:01:19.270> could<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:20.109> know<00:01:20.200> if<00:01:20.319> you're<00:01:20.439> not<00:01:20.499> careful

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
you could you know if you're not careful

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.319 
you could you know if you're not careful
you<00:01:21.130> can<00:01:21.249> damage<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.869> inside<00:01:23.289> there<00:01:23.969> so<00:01:24.969> I

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
you can damage the inside there so I

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.840 
you can damage the inside there so I
mean<00:01:26.079> that<00:01:26.259> was<00:01:26.380> really<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.740> only<00:01:26.829> thing<00:01:27.219> that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
mean that was really the only thing that

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.209 
mean that was really the only thing that
was<00:01:28.090> really<00:01:28.719> faulty<00:01:29.259> about<00:01:29.530> these<00:01:29.740> cleats<00:01:30.009> was
