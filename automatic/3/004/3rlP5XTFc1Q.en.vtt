with some chicken and pasta it's a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.930 
with some chicken and pasta it's a
really<00:00:10.139> easy<00:00:10.320> dish<00:00:10.889> like<00:00:11.340> most<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> things

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
really easy dish like most of the things

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.879 
really easy dish like most of the things
that<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.360> make<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.320> probably<00:00:13.620> whip<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
that I make and you can probably whip it

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.860 
that I make and you can probably whip it
up<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.219> 10<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> 15<00:00:14.759> minutes<00:00:15.030> if<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.750> use

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
up in 10 to 15 minutes if you use

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
up in 10 to 15 minutes if you use
ingredients<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.220> before<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.970> get

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
ingredients that I do and before we get

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.269 
ingredients that I do and before we get
into<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.420> video<00:00:18.539> there's<00:00:19.260> pasta<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
into the video there's pasta so this is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
into the video there's pasta so this is
obviously<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.880> higher<00:00:21.300> carb<00:00:21.630> dish<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.350> you're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
obviously a higher carb dish if you're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.109 
obviously a higher carb dish if you're
on<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> low-carb<00:00:22.980> diet<00:00:23.220> maybe<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> isn't<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
on a low-carb diet maybe this isn't the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.269 
on a low-carb diet maybe this isn't the
one<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.650> bulking<00:00:25.859> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
broccoli again same thing goes with the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
broccoli again same thing goes with the
broccoli<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.100> said<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.460> chicken<00:01:14.789> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
broccoli as I said with the chicken this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
broccoli as I said with the chicken this
is<00:01:15.240> frozen<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.619> stays<00:01:16.920> fresh

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
is frozen just because it stays fresh

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.029 
is frozen just because it stays fresh
for<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.940> much<00:01:18.090> longer<00:01:18.360> compared<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
for so much longer compared to the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.279 
for so much longer compared to the
traditional<00:01:20.789> unfrozen<00:01:21.300> broccoli<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
traditional unfrozen broccoli but

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.950 
traditional unfrozen broccoli but
whatever<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.399> works

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
whatever kind that you want to use works

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.330 
whatever kind that you want to use works
so<00:01:24.960> we'll<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.320> let<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.649> chicken<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
so we'll just let the chicken and the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
so we'll just let the chicken and the
broccoli<00:01:26.520> thaw<00:01:26.910> out<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.050> little<00:01:28.380> bit

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
broccoli thaw out for just a little bit

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
broccoli thaw out for just a little bit
and<00:01:28.740> once<00:01:29.580> these<00:01:29.820> two<00:01:30.000> things<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.390> cooked<00:01:30.630> up

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and once these two things are cooked up

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
and once these two things are cooked up
what<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> should<00:01:31.289> do<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.590> drain<00:01:31.830> out<00:01:32.039> any

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
what you should do is drain out any

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.639 
what you should do is drain out any
excess<00:01:32.820> water<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.630> pan<00:01:33.899> just<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
excess water in your pan just so you

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.830
