once you have the gray come in make your

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.330 
once you have the gray come in make your
lines<00:04:02.390> try<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.450> connect<00:04:03.900> them<00:04:04.110> vaguely<00:04:04.739> with

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
lines try to connect them vaguely with

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.000 
lines try to connect them vaguely with
the<00:04:05.519> thing<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.209> don't<00:04:06.510> do<00:04:07.319> stuff<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.799> I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the thing so you don't do stuff like I

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.559 
the thing so you don't do stuff like I
do

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.009 

feel<00:04:13.140> free<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.410> control<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> if<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.810> need

arises

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
arises

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.930 
arises
so<00:04:18.450> it's<00:04:18.600> our<00:04:18.780> will

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.050

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
as you see my roots aren't very straight

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.000 
as you see my roots aren't very straight
usually<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.600> do<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:30.080> Photoshop<00:04:30.260> which

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
usually I do this in Photoshop which

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
usually I do this in Photoshop which
allows<00:04:31.280> me<00:04:31.520> line<00:04:31.820> stuff<00:04:32.210> up<00:04:32.390> much<00:04:32.930> better

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
allows me line stuff up much better

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.150 
allows me line stuff up much better
