 several times the theater and 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.630
 knowing that in front of the stage below is 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.170
 orchestra and this music does not come from 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.239
 speakers as you probably think, think 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.840
 Aiza lower orchestra, that is, they are all all 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.760
 play music that's playing more accurately 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.660
 musicians but also like this 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.799
 diverse scene is so non-standard 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.080
 well, like 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.319
