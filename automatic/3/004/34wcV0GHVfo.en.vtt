00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the second round even though

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.970 
the second round even though
Lux<00:01:58.370> his<00:01:58.490> second<00:01:58.760> around<00:01:59.000> was<00:01:59.410> crazy

Lux his second around was crazy

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.160 
Lux his second around was crazy
it's<00:02:01.250> just<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.700> what<00:02:02.060> Howard<00:02:02.690> did<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.050> way

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's just that what Howard did the way

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.960 
it's just that what Howard did the way
he<00:02:03.350> kind<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.620> broke<00:02:03.830> Bluffs<00:02:04.130> down<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.640> second
