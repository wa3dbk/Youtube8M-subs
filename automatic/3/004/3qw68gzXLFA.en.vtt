00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello welcome to another new video from 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.870
 sewing channel sewing machines today 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.660
 I will show the threading of a 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.140
 industrial overlock overlocker of five 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.009
 threads let's see how is the threading 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.179
 of this one of this finishing machine and 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 good and let's show you how it goes 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.419
 we are going to open the machine 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.550
 good and we go step by step first that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.640
 put them the five threads is a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.750
 five-thread machine and good as 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.300
 we see here we have to go through the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.880
 two holes 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.860
 goes through the thread tensioner 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:59.250
 and it goes down towards the sandwiches of 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 down and I'm just going to get closer to see if 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.650
 you can see it right let's remove the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.650
 premise fabrics 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.210
 for what you see well 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 and basically basically the threading 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.060
 comes comes by colors as we see in the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.950
 map of the machine is worth then we have 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 that to follow the colors is a little 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.510
 complicated the threading of the machine 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.400
 but well there we have the 2 sancor as 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.600
 I'm going to bring a little bit closer so that 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.689
 see 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 as they are threaded with the two needles 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.509
 and I follow the path of the threading of 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.900
 the machine then good the other 3 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.280
 tensions 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.280
 is going through here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.830
 and what he does is follow the colors 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.480
 We climb the stilts of the machine with 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.820
 the two needles the two needles is more 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.820
 sencillito goes through this route 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 and goes directly to the needles or what 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.130
 I show so you can see it well 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.130
 this new fifth 9000 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.240
 and basically all the all 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.450
 rivet machines as they are threaded 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.099
 practically the same 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.940
 on the other hand it would be the threading of the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.120
 machine in the back would come the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.190
 thread would now come from the back 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.810
 I would enter through that tube 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.060
 I would go back 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 for this corner of the machine would pass 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:49.430
 for that tension 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:52.010
 and it would come to the third anchor 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.810
 well this button here I'm going to 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.140
 explain what this button is for 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.610
 here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 I'm here, serve 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.310
 it's better that we lengthen it 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 or we download it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.360
 this is for the security stitch 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.730
 to make it longer or shorter it is worth 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.290
 a shorter longer stitch of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.819
 security 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.939
 OK 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.329
 and then to make the riveting more 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.350
 Together more separated we have here the 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.300
 button 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.300
 that we have to leave it depressed 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.240
 and we move the wheel 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.319
 of the machine 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.160
 until it arrives 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.740
 to the point 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.290
 long and short with the sunken button 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.680
 we have the sunken button we have 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.410
 sunk the button 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.520
 we would see what it is 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:01.920
 the wheel to put the length that 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.920
 We want to rivet 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.310
 Basically those two are the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 functions they have with the blades 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.489
 the machine that is paddling and the one that goes 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.989
 logically cutting then we have the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.579
 Threading the machine that is very 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.770
 important we have the long and short of 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.780
 top stitching for the safety tip 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.070
 and then we have the little button 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.480
 for 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.960
 lengthen or join what is meshed 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.960
 of the machine 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.030
 well basically this is this is a 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.660
 industrial combing machine no block and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.630
 little thing more 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.020
 all or see it and all the machines 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.389
 all industrial machines then 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.550
 they are practically the same, not every 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.370
 model and each brand will have 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.190
 will have a different design good this is 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.810
 the fifth ex 9 thousand 939 thousand and good and if 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.970
 you liked the video you can 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.620
 subscribe to our channel and this 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.540
 the machine also you can purchase 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.480
 on www.hp.com and in the description of 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.590
 video I leave the links thank you very much 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.590
