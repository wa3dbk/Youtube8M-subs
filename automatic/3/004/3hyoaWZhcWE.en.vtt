that's<00:01:37.650> where<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.980> real<00:01:38.010> benefit<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that's where the real benefit is that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
that's where the real benefit is that
with<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.660> that<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.140> captures<00:01:40.620> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
with this is that it really captures the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.040 
with this is that it really captures the
detail<00:01:41.100> allows<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.630> details

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
detail allows you to really see details

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.170 
detail allows you to really see details
that<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.410> would<00:01:43.530> normally<00:01:43.680> miss<00:01:44.190> with<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that you would normally miss with it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.150 
that you would normally miss with it
with<00:01:45.330> another<00:01:45.600> camera<00:01:46.080> phone<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
with another camera phone so really

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.830 
with another camera phone so really
really<00:01:47.670> enhance<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.360> great<00:01:48.600> low-light

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
really enhance this is great low-light

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.260 
really enhance this is great low-light
situations<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> sensor<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.850> brings<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
situations the sensor really brings in a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
situations the sensor really brings in a
lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.510> light<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.860> sensor<00:01:53.070> size<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
lot of light the sensor size is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.890 
lot of light the sensor size is
incredible<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.510> bigger<00:01:54.630> than<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
incredible it's a lot bigger than a

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.500 
incredible it's a lot bigger than a
normal<00:01:55.080> sensor<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:57.060> right<00:01:57.270> take<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
normal sensor and so all right take it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.330 
normal sensor and so all right take it
back<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.720> now<00:01:57.930> we'll<00:01:58.110> show<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.100> get

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
back out now we'll show you as we get

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.600 
back out now we'll show you as we get
back<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.729> let<00:01:59.970> me<00:02:00.030> back<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> way

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
back out let me back it all the way

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.920 
back out let me back it all the way
there<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.360> we're<00:02:03.479> taking<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
there we go so we're taking back to the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.120 
there we go so we're taking back to the
camera<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.440> I'll<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.040> way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
camera one now I'll take it all the way

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
camera one now I'll take it all the way
over<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.640> full<00:02:05.880> resolution<00:02:06.119> or

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
over we're going to full resolution or

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.109 
over we're going to full resolution or
full<00:02:07.590> resolution<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.459> allows<00:02:08.640> us<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.880> shoot

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
full resolution this allows us to shoot

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.840 
full resolution this allows us to shoot
in<00:02:09.240> either<00:02:09.330> 69<00:02:09.990> aspect<00:02:10.470> ratio<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.160> 4<00:02:11.459> 3<00:02:11.490> X

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
in either 69 aspect ratio for a 4 3 X

in either 69 aspect ratio for a 4 3 X
aspect<00:02:12.780> ratio<00:02:13.140> actually<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.250> normal

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
aspect ratio actually we can go normal

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.300 
aspect ratio actually we can go normal
or<00:02:14.730> super<00:02:15.030> fine<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.540> adjust<00:02:15.870> tones

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
or super fine we can adjust tones

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
or super fine we can adjust tones
capture<00:02:17.310> mode<00:02:17.459> saturation<00:02:18.209> all<00:02:18.330> those<00:02:18.570> things

capture mode saturation all those things

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.180 
capture mode saturation all those things
we'll<00:02:19.200> leave<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> where<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> at<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.010> now

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
we'll leave it where it's at right now

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
it this is how deep we can go with the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.270 
it this is how deep we can go with the
zoom<00:02:40.610> we<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:41.000> really<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.980> right

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
zoom we can really get in on that right

9 this is a this is a this image comes

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.630 
9 this is a this is a this image comes
out<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.959> roughly<00:02:56.140> about<00:02:56.409> 34<00:02:56.920> megapixels<00:02:57.519> at

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
out to be roughly about 34 megapixels at

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.360 
out to be roughly about 34 megapixels at
the<00:02:57.760> end<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:59.200> give<00:02:59.560> or<00:02:59.680> take<00:02:59.799> with<00:03:00.040> some<00:03:00.280> of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
the end just give or take with some of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.360 
the end just give or take with some of
the<00:03:00.459> with<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.970> aspect<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.629> what<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.620> can<00:03:02.890> as

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the with the aspect and what you can as

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.550 
the with the aspect and what you can as
it<00:03:03.580> moves<00:03:03.760> around<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.120> screen<00:03:04.420> into<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.170> 16

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it moves around the screen into that 16

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050 
it moves around the screen into that 16
9<00:03:05.739> area<00:03:06.069> again<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.489> can<00:03:06.610> take<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.819> all<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:06.970> way

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
9 area again we can take it all the way

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.660 
9 area again we can take it all the way
back<00:03:07.239> out<00:03:07.480> we'll<00:03:07.599> shoot<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:07.810> three<00:03:08.670> there

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
back out we'll shoot for three there

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220 
back out we'll shoot for three there
goes<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.420> then<00:03:10.510> when<00:03:10.629> we<00:03:10.660> come<00:03:10.900> out<00:03:10.930> you'll

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
believe so yes yeah it's 1080 if you

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.289 
believe so yes yeah it's 1080 if you
shoot<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.769> highest<00:04:05.430> resolution<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.849> 1080

shoot in the highest resolution of 1080

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.059 
shoot in the highest resolution of 1080
that<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.629> steps<00:04:06.900> down<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.079> 720<00:04:07.709> when<00:04:07.829> you<00:04:07.920> shoot

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.190 
that it steps down to 720 when you shoot
at<00:04:08.160> five<00:04:08.340> megapixels<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.060> 360<00:04:09.900> when<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.109> go

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
at five megapixels and 360 when you go

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.759 
at five megapixels and 360 when you go
down<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.349> two<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:12.359> there<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.569> is<00:04:12.629> again<00:04:12.870> 808

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
