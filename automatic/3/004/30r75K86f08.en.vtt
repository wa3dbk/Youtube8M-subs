00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and friends welcome to the channel such 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.819
 we will start studying today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.189
 how to create your own 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 games I will submit information 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 comic form to be more interesting 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.450
 look however worth taking it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.090
 seriously enough lesson 1 introduction 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.580
 basic concepts and games in this lesson I 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll start teaching you to think like a programmer and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 I will show a couple of examples now we can 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 observe many familiar 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 blacksilverufa on his example we 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.449
 consider what is gaming 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 space and objects in games for this 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 we need to put it in the playroom 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 space and for ease of example 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 let it be one dimensional for now 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.559
 now you see before you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.660
 coordinate axis as always begins with 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.059
 0 and ends in our case 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.710
 the eight are those points on which can 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.210
 be our mouth for now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 intermediate values ​​we don't 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 consider and to understand the essence 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.899
 we need to look at our arthur 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 see in the spleen he has 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 one single property is not his 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.559
 positions on our axis that is let's 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.110
 now we change this value let's say on 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.119
 6 wonderful as you can see our arcturus 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.229
 gets right there on point 6 on our 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.420
 coordinate axis 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.549
 fine now we can put arthur 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 into place and use it as 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 the chair 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.439
 became their other subject which is not 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.689
 will move in our game and immediately 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.610
 the question is how to make it not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.310
 static object which stands on 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.650
 place to make it move in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's play every time for this 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.509
 add a second to his position 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.290
 unit and see what comes of it 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:40.140
 7 8 error unexpected result not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.960
 is it true because it would seem further 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.360
 should be 910 but no why so 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.229
 happened because our program is not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.790
 knows what is 9 10 minus 1 minus 2 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 she can work exclusively in 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.020
 span from zero to eight ladies can 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 set the gap much more from 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.460
 minus a billion to a billion and of course 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.229
 I'm talking about but the problem is that we 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 must ask from the gap itself 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.259
 start before we start working with 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 our program 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.300
 our time life is much easier that is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.369
 There are already various hacks bypassing 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.290
 this system 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.790
 you can create dynamic variables 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
 dwellings at a time like this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.049
 come up with almost anything however 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.970
 it is still one of the most 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.370
 wacky and simple reasons why 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.349
 cards in games are limited and so let's 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.450
 back to the very beginning add to 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.159
 our straight two more axes and we 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.959
 get full and three-dimensional 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.940
 space through which arthur can 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.099
 move and jump up to be 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.319
 more convenient let's take out his properties in 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.060
 the side is fine and as we see now u 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.040
 our arthur was added two more 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.500
 properties ie its position by 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 vertical axis and y axis that is how 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.019
 it is high and on the x and z axis it 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.310
 its position on the map, that is, if we 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.859
 we will look at our space 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.019
 top down and now we can move 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.970
 our arthur anywhere in the world 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.609
 so while I propose to move it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.579
 somewhere here look like u 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.260
 we immediately changed the coordinates and we 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.290
 Immediately understand that our mouth 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.769
 It bounced into the air up to 5 units and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.659
 moved along the x axis by 6 units but 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.879
 the question immediately arises why our 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.799
 arthur bounced but doesn't fall like that 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.769
 let's do it to artur 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.480
 every second fell down by 1 unit and 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.540
 so for greater clarity, I suggest 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.879
 enter the gender that will be on y 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.940
 equal to one let's imagine that 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.609
 will be if our arthur starts to fall 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.099
 will pass through our floor because after 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.470
 how it turns out to be equal to one on y 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.199
 exactly to the floor the next second he 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.799
 will be under our floor and so that 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.169
 to avoid 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.510
 we naturally have to introduce a small 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.879
 restriction specifically for our arthur 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.859
 due to the fact that when our arthur 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.959
 is on the plane that is it 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.150
 y coordinate is one 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.250
 then our act ceases to act on him 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.410
 conditional force of gravity that is, we 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.250
 stop every second take away from 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.250
 positions 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.280
 y unit so let 's see what 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.620
 happen in our artur of 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.750
 we will include our program and so we see 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.580
 now stopped falling as Artoo 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.140
 I congratulate you almost programmers you 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.049
 actually a little bit left 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.260
 and you little knowledge will be different 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.790
 from real programmers nobody 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.860
 Friends, I still suggest on this 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.600
 complete our first lesson see how 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.300
 it all goes what you write in 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.639
 comments and we will decide where we are 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.710
 further develop so put huskies 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.710
 subscribe to me will be very nice
