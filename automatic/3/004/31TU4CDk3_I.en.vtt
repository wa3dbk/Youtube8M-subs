alright<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.719> guys<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:33.930> junior<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:34.829> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
alright so the guys are junior was some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
alright so the guys are junior was some
kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.480> theoretic<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
kind of a theoretic thing in the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.830 
kind of a theoretic thing in the
beginning<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:39.030> wanted<00:00:39.149> something<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.629> was

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
beginning we wanted something that was

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
beginning we wanted something that was
school<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.350> would<00:00:40.410> look<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> chiro<00:00:41.520> Chet

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
school it would look like a chiro Chet

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209 
school it would look like a chiro Chet
the<00:00:42.360> co2<00:00:42.690> tanks<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.649> shoot<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the co2 tanks you know they shoot off in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600 
the co2 tanks you know they shoot off in
clubs<00:00:45.440> those<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.860> expensive<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
clubs those are just really expensive so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
clubs those are just really expensive so
we<00:00:47.640> came<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> fog<00:00:48.239> machine<00:00:48.270> idea<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we came with a fog machine idea that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
we came with a fog machine idea that
will<00:00:49.980> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> simulate<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.030> effect

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
will kind of simulate the same effect

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
will kind of simulate the same effect
that<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.760> came

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that you can get out of it so we came

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.450 
that you can get out of it so we came
out<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> geyser<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
out with that with a geyser which is a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
out with that with a geyser which is a
larger<00:00:56.460> scale<00:00:56.670> model<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> one

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
larger scale model of the to this one

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.520 
larger scale model of the to this one
and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.550> junior<00:00:59.910> version<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.930> scale<00:01:01.260> down<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and the junior version we scale down the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100 
and the junior version we scale down the
actual<00:01:02.129> unit<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.570> portable

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
actual unit so it's a lot more portable

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890 
actual unit so it's a lot more portable
now<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.670> rid<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> DM<00:01:06.270> Mac<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> can

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
now we got rid of the DM Mac so you can

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.060 
now we got rid of the DM Mac so you can
just<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.260> wireless<00:01:08.750> remote<00:01:09.750> functions<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
just use wireless remote functions and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
just use wireless remote functions and
each<00:01:11.520> four<00:01:11.880> channels<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> programmable<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.260> an

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
each four channels is programmable to an

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.810 
each four channels is programmable to an
actual<00:01:13.500> color<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> manual

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
actual color and then you have a manual

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.570 
actual color and then you have a manual
switch<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.000> well<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.340> since<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.460> using

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
switch as well so since you're using

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.149 
switch as well so since you're using
wireless<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
wireless you have a

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.039 
wireless you have a
this<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.880> transmitter<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.719> will<00:01:25.840> be<00:01:25.929> the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
this is the transmitter this will be the

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.469 
this is the transmitter this will be the
receiver<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.189> if<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.759> multiple<00:01:27.909> units

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
receiver so if you have multiple units

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.330 
receiver so if you have multiple units
you<00:01:28.600> sent<00:01:28.840> them<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.049> same<00:01:29.289> frequency<00:01:29.859> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
you sent them to the same frequency and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.099 
you sent them to the same frequency and
one<00:01:30.729> remote<00:01:31.030> will<00:01:31.149> pick<00:01:31.299> up<00:01:31.390> multiple<00:01:31.749> units

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
one remote will pick up multiple units

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.740 
one remote will pick up multiple units
all<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.549> for<00:01:33.939> example<00:01:34.030> we<00:01:34.329> have<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.450> fire

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
all right so for example we have to fire

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.429 
all right so for example we have to fire
Carl<00:01:35.140> color<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:36.640> shootout

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.620 

so<00:01:42.439> very<00:01:43.340> cool<00:01:43.640> man<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.090> there's<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.420> guess

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so very cool man and there's I guess

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.600 
so very cool man and there's I guess
what's<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:45.229> button<00:01:45.439> over<00:01:45.649> here<00:01:46.869> manual<00:01:48.610> man

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
what's this button over here manual man

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.340 
what's this button over here manual man
that<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.000> really<00:01:50.030> cool<00:01:50.420> fog<00:01:50.750> machine<00:01:51.080> at<00:01:51.229> its

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
that is really cool fog machine at its

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.219 
that is really cool fog machine at its
best<00:01:51.610> everybody's<00:01:52.610> got<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:52.909> one<00:01:53.240> Jeremy
