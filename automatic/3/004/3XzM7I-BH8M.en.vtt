00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.779
 by that late starting an issue suggested in some media 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.199
 j me the technical director 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.999
 because you find how 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.339
 Yes the player is a colleague Joris Mathijsen who earn so much more 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.710
 then earn the rest 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.669
 the same reluctance between against but it is the other way around players are angry that 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.849
 is pertinent 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.999
 just what is your a woman in this 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.789
 and no, then what is brought out is true it was all for nothing 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.699
 actually all nonsense actually 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.010
 I myself am also a separate whole day last week actually appointed that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.350
 that state has come out ever more 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.590
 yes but the nicest cause actually in the dressing room or in the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.940
 group or can join the club 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.130
 suppose that is not the case at all, his name 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.520
 I just treated it to one and I'm actually with Stefan together 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.359
 been a flaring and this for each other 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.630
 yes that's right and then we've put it out 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.399
 that it is nonsense that the that is so has come out 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.269
 It is pertinently untrue that the hassle would be making the selection over several 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.500
 salaries 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.739
 Yes for sure 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.970
 Below you will find things like this 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 yes you know of course remkes ibou the media is only years for us 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 of course a bit disturbing I think 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 everyone could return the club's own time yesterday and the most annoying after one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.250
 similar yes a bit of course at that time 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.010
 something to come to the winter circus but window 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.430
 while it is actually as a group, it was simply put in thermal mouth as well 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.660
 for the room it says that all of it is also not true and that there is 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.580
 no restlessness with changing rooms last question about this I look like one 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.870
 recommendation for the main character joris mathijsen himself 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.360
 yes know for sure after having also indicated where he is from the one on behalf of the group too 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.570
 natural the town of lukla 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 all nonsense of course to also call us winners such things 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 of course everyone knows that it did a little bother me and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.900
 yes or solace to talk 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.430
 I think I am the children's concert 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.050
 let's talk about other things that do not come with orange 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.270
 what do you think of that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.249
 That will of course I am of course always knew that Gaga likes orange 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.220
 but it is still a net profit of the national coach and the cooper 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 stock up on some and the press that they are not the only thing that matters to me 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.040
 sir gaal said i have been looking at him before you can find him 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.689
 in the fact that he is the friend 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.949
 that you are less in shape then 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.639
 ten years of finding well I know I also think that I am the last match 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.619
 yes actually not the game actually what i do what i can 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.619
 maybe I could just give him a slightly lesser phase 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.480
 and it is also just about myself for months now mandarin on top of in the 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.699
 actually, and just again the games actually play weird 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.040
 yes that person actually played a lot with there are many good matches 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.969
 I am not that you then doubt 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.599
 you can set yourself apart if it goes less 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.349
 they certainly do not have that I have there 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.959
 I never doubted and I will not do that if I am a couple in the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.349
 play competitions 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.339
 On the one hand it was a matter of being self-employed every other year 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.049
 because to focus properly and to train well for months and then 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.730
 The brand itself comes cozy 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.890
 the demolition there 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.960
 Hit the home games that are going to play now because you are in the top games 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.959
 takes fewer points than in the previous competition 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.789
 year at this club always naturally busy at all 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.869
 of course assen when you play at home 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:23.819
 yes from the last seven games big the five play at home and everyone 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
 know it in those competitions definitely have to grab points and 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.850
 nas team what do they think differently about that 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.490
 we have a tight fit to show it on 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.330
 the upcoming matches
