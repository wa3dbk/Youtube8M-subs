00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:27.260
 Again, that has wet the moment and ... 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.900
 wake up with a smile 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.160
 Again, I realize that ... 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.440
 If I am with you ... 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.340
 You could take me to places I did not imagine. 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.120
 And also... 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 No matter what others say ... 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.400
 Me, I miss that call. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.680
 Where your voice was hearing something strange. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.560
 Because at this moment ... 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.140
 Am I feeling this way? 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.640
 Is this why now? 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.880
 Excuse me. 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.380
 If they meet you, a rage stalks me ... 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.120
 You no longer have to think. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 Why is it so hard for me to stand in front of you? 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.260
 I'm imagining you with me in the future 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.580
 I have already made the commitment that I 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.020
 I will take all the time that I distance myself from you. 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.900
 Tired of wandering waiting for the touch of a person. 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.580
 That I did not know what he had and let her go. 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.540
 I have already made the commitment that I 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.060
 Knowing why you left me since that day ... 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.680
 Now I'm so sick of my heart .... 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.180
 Time will never divide us again .... 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.340
 I swear.
