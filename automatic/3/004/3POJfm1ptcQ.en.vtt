00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello it's marco middleblock and me 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.849
 I have to make a promise now 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 what I have given a little longer 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.349
 and that came here as one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 Reader's comment from you on the blog 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.710
 Articles here looks to this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 paperless study and if you have one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 scroll down a bit awi awi can 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.689
 at some point the question of people now 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 for the winter semester beginning and itself 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 ask if that's right in the middle of it all 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 good but how do I organize the best 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.769
 notebook and yes that frogs in july 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 I said or said July 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 I'll take care of it a bit 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 took longer i hope that after me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.680
 but as far as I know they have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.960
 winter semester also not yet 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 and that's why it should 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 not be so bad says first 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 In a nutshell, that's natural now 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 not the solution to everything i want 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.559
 get a short webcast sign now 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 now come quite a maximum of five 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 minutes show how i like my studio 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.219
 organized and yes you like that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 maybe it could do or one 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.570
 Let's have a look and I have it now 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250
 Here are a few notebooks 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.019
 you can open it here now 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 bonn has a nice view and I have 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.680
 for example the notebook of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 my current studies college bonn 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 So I have the victory for you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 Studying a notebook created what now 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 only for the studio should serve the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.540
 my notebook created for this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.220
 I am starting to found new ones 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.409
 very briefly you just go up here 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.150
 file comes the backstage view presses 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 here on new notebook and can here 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.080
 directly in his online notebook 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.270
 Of course, you can also save locally 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.530
 on the computer but if you block 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.759
 reads longer knows that he actually 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.200
 always recommend this on the moon 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.259
 Save it from everyone, too 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 possible terminals on it comes then 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.200
 The first tip I would do it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 you can do any case here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.990
 I see those up here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.579
 different chapter which are then at 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.229
 Just give me the different subjects 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.450
 So laid out and you should open 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 every case as the first chapter always the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.180
 Subject general or chapter 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.180
 generally just make out of that 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.890
 following reason you can just 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
 course of study the different 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.040
 more or less register things like 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.970
 for example, hourly plans of approaches 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.280
 semester stuff from the module manual 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.810
 the access to the ftp server the show 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.330
 I better not you here I know 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.850
 still not so good that's now 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.200
 not quite as interesting but here 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.280
 I wrote down in the water to that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.280
 point attests how the whole is solved 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.290
 simply halter mean stuff 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
 maybe interesting 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.350
 I think so now 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.770
 that I had my diploma thesis 20 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.600
 but no matter what I think that is still 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.500
 it would be so bad then I have 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.230
 I 'll do that for you 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.130
 different subjects always a chapter 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 as for example for this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.840
 construction engineering or environmental technology 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.459
 not stopped naming as at 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.170
 construction engineering and then I do 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 it always keeps me from doing so 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.950
 continuously in the semester me always new 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.770
 So there is always side 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.480
 first page in my chapter 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.620
 always do it through me 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.900
 maybe another different things 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.340
 purely write here are the pictures directly 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.350
 taken from month 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.420
 there the professor has at the beginning of the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.860
 In the semester he said his lecture 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.930
 build up the name of the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.220
 professors e-mail address what for 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.650
 books of you are interesting 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.060
 yes, and then it starts 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.370
 then I would do it 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.680
 at least for each lecture 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.030
 I here according to the pdf the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.860
 I was after here around 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.360
 make appropriate notes or 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.670
 not like it is here right now 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.810
 can see 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.670
 I'll go here maybe one too 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 other lecture pure what I always 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.080
 what's important is what an important tip 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.390
 It is easy to take notes 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.180
 So the lecture on an infinite 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.980
 insert long page because then stop 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.200
 can easily scroll through down 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.079
 and not here on several pages 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.850
 for those who wonder why 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.270
 at the expression here the whole always 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.740
 on several 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.210
 hesse pages print what can you do here 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.470
 in the options quite simple 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.110
 issuing is therefore on file 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.490
 options are expanded and there are here 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.110
 below the check mark small trip up 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.700
 Insert several pages if you like that 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.340
 house makes then will be asked soon 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.600
 whether you like it or not 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.820
 what I still do that is here 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.680
 All right, I have a so-called 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.690
 subchapter normal his sections 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.010
 group I called that as wrong 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.400
 Here I always move things 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.080
 down 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.730
 which I have already completed 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.230
 So hopefully from tm are now the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.790
 solution results are not there yet 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.430
 I'm very hopeful that that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.840
 whole is done now you can here 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.450
 you can always see a little better 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.920
 Here I have the 2000 off 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.620
 writes or so here you can do that 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.050
 the different lectures see the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.690
 so come in the year and then 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.980
 So, I would like to read lecture 12 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.300
 it really does go over this one 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.950
 tip I have sometime for 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.930
 I had not only used myself 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.240
 lectures single 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.270
 but just v2 or stop here 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.910
 according to 21 so exercise two task 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.550
 1 exercise two task two just that 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.630
 that is a bit clearer that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.340
 also hold strong for one 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.440
 clarity helps those are when 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.630
 you can put many undersides that can 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.720
 you can see here for example because 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.060
 I have lecture four then here 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.250
 bottom task 1 task two was 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.500
 That's easy then you can see directly 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.300
 at a glance what the like 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.280
 so they had belonged together 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.070
 that this task 1 was just here 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.130
 I spoke in lecture 4 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.780
 think that is so far clear what is there 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.520
 still to discuss oh yes what in the university 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.900
 In any case, a very good tip 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.130
 is that we make you in her 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.350
 Project off and other people 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.150
 I would have to work together for that 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.930
 a separate notebook that quickly 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.419
 for example for this 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.890
 innovation management 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.689
 that was something I have with others 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.049
 people should telephone together 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:40.499
 quiet note at presentation 

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:41.939
 performance here that is maybe now 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.229
 not the very best example of the camera 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.089
 I have seen other people here 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.969
 worked together and we had 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.649
 hold all more or less what's called 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.449
 who or less will all be accessing 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:53.909
 the same data and that was just extreme 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.009
 handy if you have it all here 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.209
 team in a personal notebook has that 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.009
 problem why you have your own 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.349
 should make notepad is that one 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.879
 if you put it in here now in the 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.229
 notebook you can not single 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.699
 sections freimann 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.039
 innovation management were in principle 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.199
 a single subject here from the semester 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.959
 you can look like that all the time 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.019
 1 led but then I have it 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.459
 here in a separate notebook notebook 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.569
 just moved because I thought that 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.779
 is better so you can do it with others 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.949
 People will share if they still have to 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.209
 have a few questions here can it 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.099
 also see again that is now from 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.269
 another study the notebook there 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.659
 then I have here, too 

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:32.309
 entire corresponding subjects had 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.329
 they are all under old lectures 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.739
 I run had twice as a 

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:36.179
 section group here for example for 

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:39.360
 had a practitioner where to stay here 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:42.360
 make different things easy 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.889
 have to try their first and so what 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.929
 principle, there is no right and no 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.669
 wrong because organization makes it stop 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:50.459
 just like you do that for you 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.289
 right as right feels what too 

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:54.300
 extremely practical is that you stop too 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.019
 notes or sections quite easily 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.829
 later move or again 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.239
 So, if I can change now 

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:01.769
 Example say that this notebook 

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:03.029
 now somewhere else should just with the 

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:04.319
 right mouse button and then there is the 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:05.789
 move or copy the little girl 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.919
 and you can get the notebook 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.419
 completely copy somewhere else 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.729
 So actually nothing could happen 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.929
 is wrong now is the webcast 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.160
 a little longer actually 

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:16.410
 thought but I hope so 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.330
 informative for you if you have questions 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.510
 Just put it in the comments and 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.640
 then I think a lot of fun in the semester 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.710
 and I hope that will work out for you 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.570
 just as useful in the study show the 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.560
 Thank you so much, see you soon
