00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.590
 Welcome to the theme of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.540
 Video presentation today I want you 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.130
 show how you are with our frame 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 general just imagine gates and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.429
 can generate grid so that the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.719
 scope of this module a bit better 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.669
 I can estimate a few 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.619
 Examples show will produce these modules 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.259
 So we see normal goals 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 double gates with tail bow with 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.449
 slope without slope and so on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 I want to create this tour 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 now like to use one 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.300
 explain example 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.150
 I go to the right on the metal construction 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 variants so our frame generator 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.230
 on the left side there are 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 different choices league 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.190
 already briefly shown that under bitter 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 straight with tail bow with stitch bow 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 normal lattice normal gates with strong 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.560
 slope and so on I decide 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.040
 me here now for the double of 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.920
 then look for ram 5 instead 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 Material material like for example 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 no 60s square before as material than 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 I would like to have frame material 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 on the three points is only one 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 virtual shelf, we are looking for mine here 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 right cab profile for example out 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 So abbreviation brh 60 40 for example 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.940
 x 3 mm material thickness back to ok have 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 here the possibility of course, too 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.850
 again as described by tenor metal it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.640
 are used to define the view 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 So 60s or 40s side since one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 on it 16x I give for the frame 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.030
 my parameters , for example 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.070
 the height determined the width of the gate 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.760
 distance to the masonry to post distance 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.890
 to the ground 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.840
 the swiss height in this case that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.050
 I just measured what I am very beautiful 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 every time I put a 1 1 on what 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.960
 In the legend, this will also turn red 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 shown 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.400
 I know exactly where I am right now 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.680
 are just measured with the abbreviation bg 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.900
 will be red accordingly 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.040
 deposited 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.040
 I want to decide next 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.260
 to call fear or not to draw 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.229
 can specify the city angle bright 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.869
 measure define the bars press ok 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.360
 and then have the finished gate as 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.040
 raw material, so to speak, on the hang 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990
 the important thing here is of course now 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.879
 also that she retroactively like her 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 Also used by gennaro metall 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.549
 to process the whole thing again 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.079
 So if I now for example the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.909
 would like to extend rods upwards 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.969
 I can mark the bars anytime 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.530
 the right mouse button to change the 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.329
 input dialog of the selected 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.730
 materials go and have the here 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.260
 possibility to change everything so 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.599
 material the material 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.409
 I can state dying supernatants 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.719
 150 mm but has the bars 150 mm by 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.230
 extended now comes a point 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.969
 put it on and so on or me 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.469
 maybe you would like another one under good 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.879
 So I'll go back to mine 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.159
 virtual shelf we are looking for mine 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.239
 material for the mother well out for 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.220
 Example 1 40 10 flat so fl 40 x 10 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.319
 If you sit under kurt quiet times diagonally 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.049
 likes her standards on the bars 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.650
 sawing off function even sets two clicks 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.780
 score cuts and their points 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.280
 accordingly the filling of the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.099
 elements on the surfaces of material 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.409
 function we are looking for a sheet metal 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.790
 my material out and clicks with the 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.799
 left out that often the area I use 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.709
 feel like the whole perforated plate 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.180
 out so it is important not now 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.069
 More necessarily that you quickly with 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.569
 This module can produce something 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.389
 but that afterwards too 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.250
 can work at will and everything 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.620
 I'm used to this from the metal 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.299
 are running in parallel with a parts list 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.919
 So in the background everything I have here 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.930
 changed what I have from face 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.639
 what I have shortened extended stands 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.069
 Sawing cities with correct saw angles 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.739
 Also in the piece is so fast and 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.319
 you can easily gate grill with tanner 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.090
 I like to call you metal 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.919
 when they ask subjects have metal 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.509
 and stay up to date 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.430
 our newsletter right on the internet 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.680
 can log on to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.750
 thanks for your attention and 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.750
 until the next video presentation
