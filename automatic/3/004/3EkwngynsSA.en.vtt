um<00:02:01.850> for<00:02:02.690> my<00:02:02.780> perk<00:02:02.960> 2<00:02:03.170> i'm<00:02:03.320> actually<00:02:03.500> using<00:02:03.650> fast

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
um for my perk 2 i'm actually using fast

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.270 
um for my perk 2 i'm actually using fast
hands<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.790> differentiates<00:02:05.420> from<00:02:06.280> amazing

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
hands but it differentiates from amazing

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.580 
hands but it differentiates from amazing
fast<00:02:07.730> hands<00:02:07.970> or<00:02:08.120> scavenger<00:02:08.630> because<00:02:08.990> say<00:02:09.470> i'm

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
fast hands or scavenger because say i'm

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.850 
fast hands or scavenger because say i'm
using<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.890> PDW<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:11.660> has<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> fattest<00:02:12.320> mag<00:02:12.560> ever

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
using a PDW it has the fattest mag ever

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.980 
using a PDW it has the fattest mag ever
so<00:02:13.130> i'm<00:02:13.310> not<00:02:13.460> going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> need<00:02:13.820> scavenger<00:02:14.510> when

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
so i'm not going to need scavenger when

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.920 
so i'm not going to need scavenger when
i<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:16.250> use<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.610> mp7<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.240> use<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> scavenger

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
i can just use the mp7 a use a scavenger

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.310 
i can just use the mp7 a use a scavenger
so<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.550> just<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:20.120> depends<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.630> what<00:02:21.080> kind<00:02:21.110> i'm

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
so it just it depends on what kind i'm

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.620 
so it just it depends on what kind i'm
using<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.680> what<00:02:21.800> class<00:02:22.010> i'm<00:02:22.190> running<00:02:22.490> for<00:02:23.090> perk

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
3 i actually use dexterity which is a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.090 
3 i actually use dexterity which is a
aim<00:02:25.700> faster<00:02:26.210> after<00:02:26.420> sprinting<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.230> let<00:02:28.010> me

tell you guys if you're using dexterity
and<00:02:30.380> your<00:02:30.710> opponent's<00:02:31.160> not<00:02:31.400> you're<00:02:32.090> going<00:02:32.180> to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
and your opponent's not you're going to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.120 
and your opponent's not you're going to
have<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> upper<00:02:32.810> hand<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.380> game<00:02:33.680> with<00:02:33.950> no

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
have the upper hand on this game with no

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.700 
have the upper hand on this game with no
other<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:35.080> honestly<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.410> aiming

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
other because honestly just aiming

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.530 
other because honestly just aiming
faster<00:02:37.280> makes<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.610> biggest<00:02:37.910> difference<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
faster makes the biggest difference you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.510 
faster makes the biggest difference you
have<00:02:38.600> an<00:02:38.810> advanced<00:02:39.380> upper<00:02:39.710> hand<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.310> guy

have an advanced upper hand on this guy

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.970 
have an advanced upper hand on this guy
i<00:02:40.790> also<00:02:41.630> use<00:02:41.810> extreme<00:02:42.110> conditioning<00:02:42.620> which<00:02:42.830> is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
i also use extreme conditioning which is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.050 
i also use extreme conditioning which is
a<00:02:43.010> sprinting<00:02:43.760> longer<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> longer<00:02:44.540> duration

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
a sprinting longer for a longer duration

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.850 
a sprinting longer for a longer duration
because<00:02:47.060> if<00:02:47.510> i<00:02:47.660> need<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.840> extra<00:02:48.290> boost<00:02:48.590> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.940 
use a combat axe if that's what you're
better<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.790> do<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.380> also<00:03:15.380> i<00:03:15.620> use

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
better with and do it also i use

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.449 
better with and do it also i use
tactical<00:03:17.020> shock<00:03:18.020> charge<00:03:18.320> for<00:03:18.800> my<00:03:18.890> tacticals

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
tactical shock charge for my tacticals

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.420 
tactical shock charge for my tacticals
and<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.959> because<00:03:21.110> if<00:03:21.470> i<00:03:21.560> throw<00:03:21.770> my<00:03:22.040> shock

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
and this is because if i throw my shock

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.670 
and this is because if i throw my shock
charge<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.330> just<00:03:23.540> stun<00:03:24.140> them<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.530> then

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
charge I can just stun them and then

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.320 
charge I can just stun them and then
throw<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.920> c4<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.550> there's<00:03:25.790> my<00:03:25.940> kill<00:03:26.180> right

hunter killer and a lightning strike and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.840 
hunter killer and a lightning strike and
for<00:03:42.080> some<00:03:42.260> weird<00:03:42.650> ass<00:03:42.830> reason<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.489> want<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.700> go

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
for some weird ass reason you want to go

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
from a lightning strike to a swarm which

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.860 
from a lightning strike to a swarm which
is<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.790> biggest<00:03:47.030> difference<00:03:47.330> because<00:03:47.750> you're

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
is the biggest difference because you're

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.290 
is the biggest difference because you're
running<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.200> 750<00:03:48.980> scorestreak<00:03:49.700> all<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.239> way

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
running a 750 scorestreak all the way

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.199 
running a 750 scorestreak all the way
down<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:51.010> 1900<00:03:52.010> scorestreak<00:03:52.640> requirement

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
down to a 1900 scorestreak requirement

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.490 
down to a 1900 scorestreak requirement
it's<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:53.840> gonna<00:03:54.020> happen<00:03:54.260> that's<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.860> biggest

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
it's not gonna happen that's the biggest

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.340 
it's not gonna happen that's the biggest
part<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.340> why<00:03:57.640> people<00:03:57.670> can't<00:03:58.360> get<00:03:58.660> good<00:03:58.870> game

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
part of why people can't get good game

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.590 
part of why people can't get good game
plays<00:03:59.590> that's<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.100> biggest<00:04:00.370> reason<00:04:00.910> because

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
plays that's the biggest reason because

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.880 
plays that's the biggest reason because
I<00:04:01.810> remember<00:04:02.050> trying<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.350> do<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.800> you

VTOL<00:04:48.669> warship<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.540> i<00:04:49.600> made<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.810> huge<00:04:50.260> jump<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
VTOL warship so i made a huge jump and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.310 
VTOL warship so i made a huge jump and
that's<00:04:50.980> because<00:04:51.130> i<00:04:51.490> can<00:04:51.850> run<00:04:52.120> those<00:04:52.320> score

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
that's because i can run those score

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.750 
that's because i can run those score
sheets<00:04:53.590> i<00:04:53.740> can<00:04:53.919> run<00:04:54.070> them<00:04:54.160> good<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.400> i<00:04:54.700> know
