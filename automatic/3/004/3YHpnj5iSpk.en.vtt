beginners<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> 25<00:01:42.119> millimeter<00:01:42.360> then

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
beginners this is the 25 millimeter then

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.389 
beginners this is the 25 millimeter then
I<00:01:43.110> believe<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> half<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> millimeter

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
I believe there is a half a millimeter

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.480 
I believe there is a half a millimeter
and<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.360> 1<00:01:45.659> millimeter<00:01:46.159> basically<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.310> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and a 1 millimeter basically what this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
and a 1 millimeter basically what this
does<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> roll<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.750> over<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.259> face

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
is that it creates tiny tiny little

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
is that it creates tiny tiny little
punctures<00:01:52.290> basically<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.490> holes<00:01:53.790> all

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
punctures basically little holes all

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
punctures basically little holes all
over<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.600> skin<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.320> roll<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.979> just

trying<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.920> say<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:05.130> basically<00:02:06.120> this

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
trying to say here basically this

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.630 
trying to say here basically this
creates<00:02:06.660> tiny<00:02:07.110> tiny<00:02:07.620> little<00:02:07.800> holes<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.580> over

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
creates tiny tiny little holes all over

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.450 
creates tiny tiny little holes all over
your<00:02:09.240> skin<00:02:09.570> wherever<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.380> roll<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.800> creating

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
your skin wherever you roll it creating

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.340 
your skin wherever you roll it creating
these<00:02:11.610> tiny<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.060> puncture<00:02:12.690> marks<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.170> just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
these tiny little puncture marks I just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
these tiny little puncture marks I just
want<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.590> say<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> bat<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.940> going

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
want to say off the bat it's not going

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.120 
want to say off the bat it's not going
to<00:02:15.209> make<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.480> bleed<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.380> draw<00:02:16.770> blood

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
to make you bleed it does not draw blood

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.610 
to make you bleed it does not draw blood
at<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.240> whole<00:02:18.450> point<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.930> penetrating

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
at all so the whole point of penetrating

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.100 
at all so the whole point of penetrating
your<00:02:19.830> skin<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.490> your<00:02:21.000> skin<00:02:21.360> interprets

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
your skin is that your skin interprets

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.870 
your skin is that your skin interprets
all<00:02:22.290> these<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:22.860> holes<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.459> created

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
all these little holes that you created

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.449 
all these little holes that you created
as<00:02:24.150> wounds<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.290> return<00:02:25.740> your<00:02:26.100> skin

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
as wounds so in return your skin

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.270 
as wounds so in return your skin
produces<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> lot<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.600> collagen<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.350> elastin

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
produces a lot more collagen and elastin

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.670 
produces a lot more collagen and elastin
making<00:02:29.880> new<00:02:30.150> fresh<00:02:30.540> skin<00:02:30.900> cells<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.380> basically

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
making new fresh skin cells to basically

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.400 
making new fresh skin cells to basically
repair<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.820> wounds<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.630> created<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
repair the wounds that you created and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
repair the wounds that you created and
those<00:02:34.830> new<00:02:35.070> fresh<00:02:35.430> skin<00:02:35.760> cells<00:02:36.030> basically

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
those new fresh skin cells basically

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.930 
those new fresh skin cells basically
diminish<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.470> scars<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.250> basically<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
diminish your scars so basically the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430 
diminish your scars so basically the
bottom<00:02:39.090> line<00:02:39.330> here<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.410> are

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bottom line here is that you are

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.949 
bottom line here is that you are
tricking<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.190> skin<00:02:41.520> into<00:02:41.760> healing<00:02:42.420> itself<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
tricking your skin into healing itself a

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.260 
tricking your skin into healing itself a
lot<00:02:43.230> faster<00:02:43.800> than<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.130> normally<00:02:44.340> would<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:45.000> its

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
lot faster than it normally would on its

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.150 
lot faster than it normally would on its
own<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> kit<00:02:46.770> looks<00:02:46.980> like

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
own so this is what the kit looks like

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.190 
own so this is what the kit looks like
right<00:02:47.370> here<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> does<00:02:48.209> come<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
