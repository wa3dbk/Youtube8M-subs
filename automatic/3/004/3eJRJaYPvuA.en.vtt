00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
episode and I have managed to build a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
episode and I have managed to build a
bunch<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> them<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.450> let's<00:00:36.450> start<00:00:36.660> taking<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
bunch of them so let's start taking a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
bunch of them so let's start taking a
look<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.290> shall<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.420> see

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
look at these shall we and we can see

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.209 
look at these shall we and we can see
which<00:00:39.780> ones<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:40.500> obviously<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
which ones we like best obviously I

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.490 
which ones we like best obviously I
suggested<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> wooden<00:00:42.390> plank<00:00:42.629> idea<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
suggested the wooden plank idea for the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.810 
suggested the wooden plank idea for the
houses<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.860> thought<00:00:44.010> it'd<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> simplest

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
houses I thought it'd be the simplest

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
houses I thought it'd be the simplest
and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> thought<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> looked<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.719> good<00:00:45.899> um

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and I thought it looked pretty good um

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.080 
and I thought it looked pretty good um
don't<00:00:47.010> worry<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> white<00:00:47.640> block<00:00:47.879> there

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
don't worry about that white block there

I mentioned that I didn't want to do
smooth<00:01:38.130> stone<00:01:38.400> cuz<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> whole<00:01:38.790> house<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
smooth stone cuz the whole house is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.780 
smooth stone cuz the whole house is
already<00:01:39.450> smooth<00:01:39.659> stone<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.020> he<00:01:40.140> said<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
already smooth stone and he said that

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.749 
already smooth stone and he said that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sometimes you know keeping it keeping it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
sometimes you know keeping it keeping it
more<00:01:44.939> consistent<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> good<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
more consistent is a good thing so I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.230 
more consistent is a good thing so I
thought<00:01:46.530> I'd<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> smooth<00:01:47.490> stone<00:01:47.700> wall<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thought I'd make a smooth stone wall and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.310 
thought I'd make a smooth stone wall and
honor<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.380> highjack<00:01:49.860> Reaper<00:01:50.540> with<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.899> sign

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320

cool idea but I'm not sure about the
sandstone<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.300> then<00:05:03.810> finally<00:05:04.229> we<00:05:04.319> have<00:05:04.469> arty

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
sandstone and then finally we have arty

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.499 
sandstone and then finally we have arty
arty<00:05:05.280> Artemis<00:05:06.000> with<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:07.580> brick<00:05:08.580> walls<00:05:08.969> idea

arty Artemis with the brick walls idea

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.279 
arty Artemis with the brick walls idea
now<00:05:09.750> this<00:05:09.960> would<00:05:10.139> look<00:05:10.289> fantastic<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:12.229> I<00:05:13.229> do

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
now this would look fantastic and I do

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.779 
now this would look fantastic and I do
have<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> lot<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.069> brick<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:15.919> maybe<00:05:16.919> even<00:05:17.159> if<00:05:17.580> I

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
have a lot of brick and maybe even if I

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.469 
have a lot of brick and maybe even if I
remove<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.750> bottom<00:05:19.110> layer<00:05:19.349> of<00:05:19.379> brick<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.729> put

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
remove the bottom layer of brick and put

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.269 
remove the bottom layer of brick and put
in<00:05:21.629> smooth<00:05:21.960> stone<00:05:22.879> again<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.930> idea<00:05:25.259> of<00:05:25.560> make

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
in smooth stone again the idea of make

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.059 
in smooth stone again the idea of make
Justin<00:05:26.729> Berger<00:05:27.029> I<00:05:27.060> think<00:05:27.650> smooth<00:05:28.650> stone<00:05:28.860> layer

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
Justin Berger I think smooth stone layer

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.010 
Justin Berger I think smooth stone layer
along<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.550> bottom<00:05:29.789> in<00:05:29.969> the<00:05:30.060> top<00:05:30.270> with<00:05:30.779> brick

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
along the bottom in the top with brick

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.080 
along the bottom in the top with brick
in<00:05:31.139> between<00:05:31.469> that<00:05:32.069> might<00:05:32.310> look<00:05:32.460> amazing<00:05:32.969> and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
in between that might look amazing and

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.779 
in between that might look amazing and
that<00:05:33.240> might<00:05:33.479> be<00:05:33.800> what<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.830> end<00:05:35.069> up<00:05:35.099> doing<00:05:35.159> but<00:05:35.580> I

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789
