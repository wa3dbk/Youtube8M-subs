just take it off a cougar responds very
well<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.640> photinia<00:02:56.640> here's<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.150> plant

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
well to that photinia here's a plant

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.199 
well to that photinia here's a plant
that<00:02:57.600> responds<00:02:58.110> well<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:59.030> renewal<00:03:00.030> pruning

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
that responds well to renewal pruning

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.210 
that responds well to renewal pruning
but<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.810> plant<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.319> has<00:03:01.530> difficulties

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
but it's a plant that has difficulties

but it's a plant that has difficulties
in<00:03:02.340> our<00:03:02.459> area<00:03:03.140> people<00:03:04.140> tend<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.350> shear<00:03:04.680> them

and<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.519> more<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.730> shear<00:03:06.060> them<00:03:06.239> they<00:03:06.480> tend<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and the more you shear them they tend to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.930 
and the more you shear them they tend to
get<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> leaf<00:03:07.680> spot<00:03:07.980> disease<00:03:08.190> which<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.580> very

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
get a leaf spot disease which is very

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.690 
get a leaf spot disease which is very
serious<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:10.049> photinia<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.130> either<00:03:11.340> try<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
serious for photinia so either try to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.789 
serious for photinia so either try to
let<00:03:11.880> your<00:03:12.030> photinia<00:03:12.480> go<00:03:12.720> or<00:03:13.049> try<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.319> change<00:03:13.590> to

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
really shouldn't be sheared should try

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.290 
really shouldn't be sheared should try
hand<00:05:43.740> pruning<00:05:44.130> them<00:05:44.220> they<00:05:44.700> do<00:05:44.760> a<00:05:44.910> lot<00:05:45.090> better

hand pruning them they do a lot better

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.120 
hand pruning them they do a lot better
when<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:45.630> hand<00:05:45.870> prune<00:05:46.080> them<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:46.470> if<00:05:46.860> they<00:05:46.889> get

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
when you hand prune them and if they get

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.159 
when you hand prune them and if they get
too<00:05:47.310> large<00:05:47.550> this<00:05:48.120> time<00:05:48.389> of<00:05:48.419> year<00:05:48.539> you<00:05:48.780> can<00:05:48.990> cut

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
too large this time of year you can cut

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.890 
too large this time of year you can cut
them<00:05:49.229> back<00:05:49.410> very<00:05:49.800> low<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.310> they<00:05:50.729> will<00:05:51.000> regrow

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
them back very low and they will regrow

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.750 
them back very low and they will regrow
nicely<00:05:52.410> yeah<00:05:53.030> well<00:05:54.030> what<00:05:54.389> about<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.690> Barbary

absolutely take them down to the ground

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.300 
absolutely take them down to the ground
make<00:06:06.690> them<00:06:06.840> skinnier<00:06:07.349> make<00:06:07.860> them<00:06:08.039> blower

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.370 
make them skinnier make them blower
they'll<00:06:08.910> grow<00:06:09.150> back<00:06:09.180> very<00:06:09.720> nicely<00:06:10.020> they'll

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
they'll grow back very nicely they'll

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.820 
they'll grow back very nicely they'll
reward<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:11.060> yeah<00:06:12.060> yeah<00:06:12.930> sky<00:06:13.200> pencil<00:06:13.650> Holly

it's a really thin narrow Japanese Holly
and<00:06:16.760> some<00:06:17.760> of<00:06:17.880> them<00:06:18.060> are<00:06:18.210> not<00:06:18.479> as<00:06:18.810> stout<00:06:19.289> as<00:06:19.349> we

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
and some of them are not as stout as we

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.830 
and some of them are not as stout as we
would<00:06:20.370> like<00:06:20.400> them<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.729> be<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.180> I<00:06:21.510> think<00:06:21.720> what

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
would like them to be and I think what

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.290 
would like them to be and I think what
you<00:06:21.960> need<00:06:22.110> to<00:06:22.200> do<00:06:22.320> on<00:06:22.470> them<00:06:22.650> is<00:06:22.860> really<00:06:23.820> cheer

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
you need to do on them is really cheer

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.480 
you need to do on them is really cheer
them<00:06:24.539> up<00:06:24.570> tightly<00:06:25.080> all<00:06:25.410> the<00:06:25.680> time<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:26.190> you'll

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
them up tightly all the time and you'll

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.550 
them up tightly all the time and you'll
get<00:06:26.669> that<00:06:26.910> lots<00:06:27.479> of<00:06:27.660> multi<00:06:27.960> branching<00:06:28.470> and

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
get that lots of multi branching and

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.839 
get that lots of multi branching and
that's<00:06:28.979> what's<00:06:29.190> going<00:06:29.280> to<00:06:29.370> make<00:06:29.460> them<00:06:29.610> tough

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
that's what's going to make them tough

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.180 
that's what's going to make them tough
but<00:06:30.479> you<00:06:30.570> need<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.810> do<00:06:30.930> it<00:06:31.050> often<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:31.979> know<00:06:32.099> you

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
but you need to do it often you know you

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.710 
but you need to do it often you know you
need<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.550> every<00:06:32.910> time<00:06:33.060> they<00:06:33.240> start<00:06:33.450> to<00:06:33.539> grow

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720
