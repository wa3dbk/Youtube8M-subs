00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.739
 by measurement and that's because you are so 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.379

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.820
 dynamo but oil with his own hands 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 commodity units 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.290
 according to unofficial estimates this program 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.220
 aimed at later 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.129

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 opening points 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.130
 so in the first days are those who 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.520
 just don't know the rains 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.619
