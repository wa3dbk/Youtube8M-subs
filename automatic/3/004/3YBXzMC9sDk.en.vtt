00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:20.533
 I have very deep feelings for this half-man statue 

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:27.100
 Who looks at you with a quiet, deep look and a kind of smile 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.533
 Which radiates a sarcasm. 

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.233
 When the Metropolitan was lucky enough to get this statue in 

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.200
 1996, was a real challenge 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.400
 Discover the identity of the representative. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 It's a great mystery: 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.133
 Who is he, of his making? 

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.967
 Wigs and shield guides. 

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:54.000
 This wigs were very common in the late 17th century. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 If we look closely at the shield, 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.567
 It tells us a whole story 

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.967
 In detail. 

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:07.133
 Alexander the Great. Then the names began to follow. 

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:13.000
 A colleague drew my attention to a portrait of Alexander Manchikov, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 Who was chosen by Peter the Great to be the General Marshal 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.266
 On all Russians, in 1703. 

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.333
 He was very well known 

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.467
 In his careful behavior. 

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.900
 When Catherine the First took office 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.867
 He ran the country practically. And after death 

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.767
 Catherine, was sent to Siberia. 

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:40.000
 The aristocrats tried to erase 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.100
 His memory. There are less than a dozen of his plate. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.734
 We know from descriptions that Alexander Manchikov has a very high front, and our eyes 

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.433
 Very versatile and strong, 

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:59.767
 These two lips are particularly delicate. The program is filmed 

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.334
 After careful consideration. 

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:05.367
 It must be the result of cooperation 

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:06.900
 Between the shepherd 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.300
 And the artist 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.734
 To make a monument 

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:15.166
 It lasts. The artist was able 

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.567
 To embody in the wood figure 

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.634
 The man carved. 

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:23.667
 Even if we can not know the name of the artist, 

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:27.333
 It's just the beginning. Now we have all the time 

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:31.233
 To discover the rest.
