00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
would never think of doing myself it's a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.910 
would never think of doing myself it's a
dup<00:00:58.590> program<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.430> every<00:01:00.270> day<00:01:00.440> like<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.680> lips

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
dup program so every day like my lips

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
dup program so every day like my lips
are<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.969> rep<00:01:03.149> ranges<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.690> completely

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
are the rep ranges are completely

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
are the rep ranges are completely
different<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.030> helps<00:01:06.330> training<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
different so it really helps training in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.179 
different so it really helps training in
different<00:01:07.080> rep<00:01:07.200> ranges<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.680> least<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.950> found

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.410 
different rep ranges at least I found
for<00:01:08.400> myself<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.520> helped

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
for myself and it just has really helped

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070 
for myself and it just has really helped
add<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> my<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:14.340> 1<00:01:14.580> 2<00:01:14.820> &amp;<00:01:15.030> 3<00:01:15.060> rep<00:01:15.420> max<00:01:15.600> lifts

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

but<00:03:44.430> grinded<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.579> out<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:45.970> was<00:03:46.030> really

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
but grinded that out and I was really

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.479 
but grinded that out and I was really
happy<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.140> hoping<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.220> progress

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
happy with that and hoping to progress

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.670 
happy with that and hoping to progress
on<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.730> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.150> upcoming<00:03:49.600> weeks<00:03:50.079> here<00:03:50.530> was

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
on that in the upcoming weeks here was

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550 
on that in the upcoming weeks here was
one<00:03:50.860> of<00:03:50.980> my<00:03:51.190> back<00:03:51.579> offsets<00:03:52.380> typically<00:03:53.380> what<00:03:53.530> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
one of my back offsets typically what I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.100 
one of my back offsets typically what I
do<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:54.220> I'll<00:03:54.579> hit<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.940> prescribed<00:03:55.600> rep<00:03:55.840> range

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
do is I'll hit the prescribed rep range

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.009 
do is I'll hit the prescribed rep range
for<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.680> day<00:03:56.920> at<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> top<00:03:57.760> set<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.360> then<00:03:58.900> I'll

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
for that day at a top set and then I'll

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.630 
for that day at a top set and then I'll
drop<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.440> weight<00:03:59.590> down<00:03:59.829> anywhere<00:04:00.370> from

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
drop the weight down anywhere from

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.509 
drop the weight down anywhere from
usually<00:04:01.150> about<00:04:01.299> five<00:04:01.570> ten<00:04:02.110> percent<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.829> then

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
usually about five ten percent and then

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.670 
usually about five ten percent and then
hit<00:04:03.820> some<00:04:04.299> back<00:04:04.480> offsets<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:05.320> actually

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
hit some back offsets this actually

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.199 
hit some back offsets this actually
wasn't<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:06.010> backup<00:04:06.310> set<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.609> was<00:04:06.820> a<00:04:06.850> pause

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
wasn't a backup set this was a pause

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.590 
wasn't a backup set this was a pause
squat<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.900> was<00:04:08.500> doing<00:04:08.739> two<00:04:09.549> sets<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.000> two<00:04:10.209> reps<00:04:10.420> I

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
squat I was doing two sets of two reps I

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.830 
squat I was doing two sets of two reps I
hit<00:04:10.750> 325<00:04:11.320> for<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.859> I<00:04:12.600> feel<00:04:13.600> like<00:04:13.660> that's

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
hit 325 for that I feel like that's

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.690 
hit 325 for that I feel like that's
really<00:04:14.109> helped<00:04:14.470> my<00:04:14.590> squat<00:04:14.890> lately<00:04:15.340> trying<00:04:15.579> to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
really helped my squat lately trying to

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.979 
really helped my squat lately trying to
be<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.820> little<00:04:16.000> more<00:04:16.180> explosive<00:04:16.720> out<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
be a little more explosive out of the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.740 
be a little more explosive out of the
hole<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:18.479> been<00:04:19.479> liking<00:04:19.870> doing<00:04:20.169> those<00:04:20.349> just

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
hole and been liking doing those just

a different<00:04:21.470> way<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.620> train<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.640> muscles<00:04:23.000> to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
a different way to train the muscles to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.310 
a different way to train the muscles to
contribute<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:25.100> progressing<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:25.760> my<00:04:25.790> squat

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
contribute to progressing in my squat

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.450 
contribute to progressing in my squat
here<00:04:27.320> was<00:04:28.210> dead<00:04:29.210> lifts<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:30.200> was<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.460> third

here was dead lifts this was a third

here was dead lifts this was a third
work<00:04:31.700> out<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.060> week<00:04:32.240> two<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:33.110> first<00:04:33.380> two

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
work out of week two the first two

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.140 
work out of week two the first two
workouts<00:04:34.040> I<00:04:34.220> didn't<00:04:34.370> bring<00:04:34.460> my<00:04:34.520> camera<00:04:34.880> that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
workouts I didn't bring my camera that

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.240 
workouts I didn't bring my camera that
was<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.300> bench<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.750> squat<00:04:36.080> workout<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
was a bench and squat workout but the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.370 
was a bench and squat workout but the
volume<00:04:37.460> on<00:04:37.730> those<00:04:37.940> days<00:04:38.150> was<00:04:38.360> insane<00:04:38.810> was<00:04:39.170> a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
volume on those days was insane was a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.110 
volume on those days was insane was a
bunch<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.160> sets<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.520> four<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:43.120> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
bunch of sets of four and then if the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.820 
bunch of sets of four and then if the
volume<00:04:44.270> was<00:04:44.600> crazy<00:04:44.870> was<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.140> bunch<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.470> sets<00:04:45.710> of

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
volume was crazy was a bunch of sets of

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.520 
volume was crazy was a bunch of sets of
four<00:04:46.070> top<00:04:46.400> set<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.730> few<00:04:46.970> back<00:04:47.180> offsets<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.840> then

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
four top set a few back offsets and then

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.150 
four top set a few back offsets and then
to<00:04:49.280> amrap<00:04:49.790> sets<00:04:50.120> at<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:51.590> ten<00:04:51.830> percent

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
to amrap sets at I think ten percent

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.290 
to amrap sets at I think ten percent
less<00:04:52.370> than<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.670> weight<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:53.000> was<00:04:53.150> working

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
less than the weight that I was working

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.080 
less than the weight that I was working
with<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:53.810> this<00:04:54.620> week<00:04:55.250> two<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.550> blue<00:04:55.880> eyes<00:04:56.060> is

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
with so this week two of blue eyes is

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.090 
with so this week two of blue eyes is
probably<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.840> highest<00:04:57.169> volume<00:04:57.710> week<00:04:57.919> of

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
probably the highest volume week of

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.290 
probably the highest volume week of
training<00:04:58.340> I've<00:04:58.669> ever<00:04:58.820> done<00:04:59.000> in<00:04:59.150> my<00:04:59.180> entire

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
training I've ever done in my entire

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.620 
training I've ever done in my entire
life<00:04:59.780> but<00:05:00.050> definitely<00:05:00.980> helps<00:05:01.490> when<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.390> comes

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
life but definitely helps when it comes

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.210 
life but definitely helps when it comes
to<00:05:02.870> making<00:05:03.169> progress<00:05:03.380> especially<00:05:03.860> when

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
to making progress especially when

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.730 
to making progress especially when
you're<00:05:04.370> hitting<00:05:04.550> only<00:05:05.150> about<00:05:05.750> two<00:05:06.200> or<00:05:06.470> three

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
you're hitting only about two or three

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.560 
you're hitting only about two or three
rep<00:05:06.919> Max's<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> following<00:05:08.000> week<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.450> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
rep Max's the following week so the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.010 
rep Max's the following week so the
volume<00:05:08.690> decreases<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.470> lot<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:11.690> like<00:05:11.900> I

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
volume decreases a lot and this like I

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.240 
volume decreases a lot and this like I
said<00:05:12.230> was<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.500> third<00:05:12.680> workout<00:05:13.040> of<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.190> week

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
said was the third workout of the week

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.510 
said was the third workout of the week
deadlifts<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.060> hit<00:05:14.210> 475<00:05:15.020> for<00:05:15.320> five<00:05:15.500> reps<00:05:15.860> form

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
deadlifts I hit 475 for five reps form

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.650 
deadlifts I hit 475 for five reps form
probably<00:05:16.850> could<00:05:16.970> have<00:05:17.000> been<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.210> little<00:05:17.450> bit

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
probably could have been a little bit

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.240 
probably could have been a little bit
better<00:05:17.780> but<00:05:18.110> overall<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.680> was<00:05:18.860> pretty<00:05:18.890> happy

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
better but overall I was pretty happy

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.340 
better but overall I was pretty happy
with<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.610> here<00:05:20.360> was<00:05:20.480> one<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> back<00:05:20.900> offsets

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
with it here was one of the back offsets

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.630 
with it here was one of the back offsets
I<00:05:21.500> sped<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.890> up<00:05:21.980> just<00:05:22.190> because<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.490> was<00:05:22.580> a

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
I sped it up just because it was a

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.659 
I sped it up just because it was a
little<00:05:22.760> bit<00:05:22.910> slow<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.480> this<00:05:24.169> was<00:05:24.380> 450<00:05:25.100> so<00:05:25.490> that

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
little bit slow and this was 450 so that

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.030 
little bit slow and this was 450 so that
was<00:05:25.760> about<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.030> five<00:05:26.930> percent<00:05:27.350> drop<00:05:27.590> in<00:05:27.740> weight

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
was about a five percent drop in weight

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.940 
was about a five percent drop in weight
and<00:05:28.570> hit<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.690> again<00:05:29.870> for<00:05:30.200> another<00:05:30.320> five<00:05:30.620> reps

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950
