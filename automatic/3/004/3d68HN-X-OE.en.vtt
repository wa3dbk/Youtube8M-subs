00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
curl pattern by you know bonding it you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.510 
curl pattern by you know bonding it you
can<00:01:16.140> straighten<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.340> whatever

you want with it but I thought the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
you want with it but I thought the
natural<00:01:19.320> curl<00:01:19.530> pattern<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.460> really

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
natural curl pattern was really really

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.249 
natural curl pattern was really really
pretty<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> wanted<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> show<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pretty and so I wanted to show it to you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
pretty and so I wanted to show it to you
like<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.890> really<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> fullness<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
like that I really like the fullness of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
like that I really like the fullness of
the<00:01:24.750> four<00:01:24.930> bundles<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.830> perfect<00:01:26.400> as

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the four bundles I think it's perfect as

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
the four bundles I think it's perfect as
it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.479> haven't<00:01:28.439> experienced<00:01:29.100> any<00:01:29.310> tangling

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
guides is the fact that the closure

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.490 
guides is the fact that the closure
there<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> an<00:01:36.329> issue<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> closure<00:01:37.140> with

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
