so<00:02:32.590> much<00:02:32.740> emotion<00:02:33.040> tied<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.880> title

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
so much emotion tied up in that title

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.210 
so much emotion tied up in that title
but<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:35.050> was<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.380> exciting<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.860> see<00:02:36.070> how

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
but it was really exciting to see how

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.790 
but it was really exciting to see how
people<00:02:36.250> who<00:02:36.970> had<00:02:37.660> no<00:02:37.930> experience<00:02:38.350> with<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
people who had no experience with it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.250 
people who had no experience with it
before<00:02:39.120> still<00:02:40.120> latched<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.810> those<00:02:40.990> game

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
before still latched on to those game

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.070 
before still latched on to those game
mechanics<00:02:41.800> pain<00:02:45.630> we<00:02:46.630> started<00:02:46.930> with<00:02:46.990> a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
mechanics pain we started with a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.990 
mechanics pain we started with a
prototype<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.650> was<00:02:47.890> very<00:02:48.130> very<00:02:48.370> close<00:02:48.820> to

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
prototype that was very very close to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.610 
prototype that was very very close to
the<00:02:49.120> original<00:02:49.180> game<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.930> we<00:02:50.020> said<00:02:50.230> look<00:02:50.440> these

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
the original game and we said look these

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.200 
the original game and we said look these
are<00:02:50.710> these<00:02:50.920> core<00:02:51.220> elements<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.090> original

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
are these core elements of the original

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.470 
are these core elements of the original
game<00:02:52.480> bit<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.440> want<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:55.360> be

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
game bit that we want to to be

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.970 
game bit that we want to to be
translated<00:02:56.020> into<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.260> modern<00:02:56.440> element<00:02:56.890> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
translated into the modern element and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.800 
translated into the modern element and
that's<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.850> things<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.420> fog<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.630> war

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
that's the things like the fog of war

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.400 
that's the things like the fog of war
the<00:02:59.440> environmental<00:03:00.190> destruction<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.990> nature

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
the environmental destruction the nature

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.490 
the environmental destruction the nature
of<00:03:02.440> challenge<00:03:03.250> which<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.700> important<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
of challenge which is important and the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.550 
of challenge which is important and the
real<00:03:05.770> high<00:03:06.250> stakes<00:03:06.670> combat<00:03:07.660> where<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.470> know

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
real high stakes combat where you know

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.170 
real high stakes combat where you know
your<00:03:08.709> soldiers<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.190> actually<00:03:09.520> die<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.090> they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
your soldiers can actually die and they

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.870 
your soldiers can actually die and they
won't<00:03:10.360> come<00:03:10.600> back<00:03:10.920> those<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.310> high<00:03:12.340> stakes

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
won't come back those really high stakes

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.850 
won't come back those really high stakes
moments<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.660> create<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> feeling<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.620> real

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
moments that create a feeling of real

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.699 
moments that create a feeling of real
success<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:16.720> happened<00:03:17.110> is<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.410> you

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
success and so what happened is that you

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.350 
success and so what happened is that you
know<00:03:17.800> as<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.220> game<00:03:18.400> evolved<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.060> as<00:03:19.150> we

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
know as the game evolved and as we

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.390 
know as the game evolved and as we
modified<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:19.989> mechanics<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:20.860> found<00:03:21.190> that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
modified the mechanics we found that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.290 
modified the mechanics we found that
those<00:03:21.580> original<00:03:23.250> concepts<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.489> environmental

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
those original concepts of environmental

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.910 
those original concepts of environmental
destruction<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.930> challenge<00:03:26.260> they<00:03:26.500> remain

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
destruction and challenge they remain

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.740 
destruction and challenge they remain
because<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.400> think<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:27.760> those<00:03:27.910> are<00:03:27.940> universal

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
because I think that those are universal

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.410 
because I think that those are universal
the<00:03:29.320> underlying<00:03:29.770> mechanics<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.459> course<00:03:30.730> we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
the underlying mechanics of course we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.330 
the underlying mechanics of course we
modified<00:03:32.020> based<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.470> everything<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:32.950> know

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
modified based on everything we know

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.509 
modified based on everything we know
based<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:35.019> know<00:03:35.140> new<00:03:35.380> design<00:03:35.860> techniques

based on you know new design techniques

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.000 
based on you know new design techniques
that<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:36.820> have<00:03:37.090> based<00:03:37.810> on<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.560> know<00:03:38.650> all<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
that we have based on you know all the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.080 
that we have based on you know all the
different<00:03:39.250> things<00:03:39.280> we've<00:03:39.549> learned<00:03:39.580> as<00:03:39.970> an

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
different things we've learned as an

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.900 
different things we've learned as an
industry<00:03:40.330> but<00:03:41.080> really<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.709> core<00:03:42.100> elements<00:03:42.850> of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
industry but really the core elements of

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.690 
industry but really the core elements of
that<00:03:43.060> original<00:03:43.299> game<00:03:43.810> they<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.890> translated

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
that original game they have translated

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.090 
that original game they have translated
beautifully<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.720> modern<00:03:47.230> systems<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.950> to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
beautifully to modern systems and to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.200 
beautifully to modern systems and to
modern<00:03:48.549> gameplay

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.010 

we<00:03:54.210> have<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.540> thing<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:54.930> call

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
we have this thing that we call

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.020 
we have this thing that we call
internally<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:55.920> call<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> glam<00:03:56.400> cam<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.970> we

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
internally we call the glam cam and we

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.390 
internally we call the glam cam and we
took<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.300> lot<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.510> inspiration<00:03:58.110> from<00:03:58.710> Bethesda

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
took a lot of inspiration from Bethesda

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920 
took a lot of inspiration from Bethesda
and<00:03:59.430> their<00:03:59.610> vast<00:03:59.910> camera<00:04:00.330> from<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.570> fallout

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
and their vast camera from the fallout

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.510 
and their vast camera from the fallout
game<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.350> what<00:04:01.500> happens<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.370> lot

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
game and what happens is that in a lot

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.670 
game and what happens is that in a lot
of<00:04:02.640> dramatic<00:04:02.990> shots<00:04:03.990> we<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.440> bring<00:04:04.650> that

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
of dramatic shots we can bring that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.100 
of dramatic shots we can bring that
camera<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.640> show<00:04:06.000> your<00:04:06.240> soldier<00:04:06.720> lining

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
camera in and show your soldier lining

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.750 
camera in and show your soldier lining
up<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.410> shot<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.920> show<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.100> beautiful

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
up that shot and show that beautiful

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.780 
up that shot and show that beautiful
kill<00:04:09.030> shot<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.990> has<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.380> really<00:04:10.790> it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
kill shot and it has this really it

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.540 
kill shot and it has this really it
really<00:04:11.870> sort<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.959> reinforces<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
really sort of reinforces like the the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.460 
really sort of reinforces like the the
nature<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:14.940> comet<00:04:15.330> is<00:04:15.390> very<00:04:15.540> visceral<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.260> so

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
nature of comet is very visceral and so

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.110 
nature of comet is very visceral and so
that's<00:04:16.620> something<00:04:16.890> we're<00:04:17.220> really<00:04:17.459> excited

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
that's something we're really excited

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.430 
that's something we're really excited
about<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.510> well<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:18.900> always<00:04:19.079> been<00:04:19.230> the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
about as well it's always been the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.870 
about as well it's always been the
question<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:19.980> why<00:04:20.100> isn't<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.459> game<00:04:20.700> than

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
question then why isn't this game than

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.330 
question then why isn't this game than
men<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.359> reason<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.170> it's<00:04:22.590> it's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
men and the reason is because it's it's

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.730 
men and the reason is because it's it's
absolutely<00:04:23.970> insane<00:04:24.090> as<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.810> game<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.380> mean<00:04:25.590> it

ambition and scope and I think that it's

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.659 
ambition and scope and I think that it's
something<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.350> resonates<00:04:52.919> so<00:04:53.100> strong<00:04:53.430> with

something that resonates so strong with

something that resonates so strong with
people<00:04:53.970> because<00:04:54.120> there<00:04:54.510> still<00:04:54.600> is<00:04:54.840> nothing

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
people because there still is nothing

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.140 
people because there still is nothing
like<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.530> I'm<00:04:55.590> so<00:04:55.860> excited<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.700> introduce
