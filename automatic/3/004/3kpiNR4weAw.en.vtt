so<00:00:00.450> if<00:00:00.570> one<00:00:00.750> third<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.170> whole<00:00:01.410> equals

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
so if one third of a whole equals

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.249 
so if one third of a whole equals
thirty-three<00:00:02.129> percent<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:03.210> come<00:00:03.419> 31<00:00:03.959> thirds

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
thirty-three percent how come 31 thirds

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.639 
thirty-three percent how come 31 thirds
equal<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.770> whole<00:00:05.750> mathematics<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.410> they

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
equal a whole mathematics how do they

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.280 
equal a whole mathematics how do they
work<00:00:07.940> all<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.269> first<00:00:09.599> order<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.960> business

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
work all right first order of business

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.200 
work all right first order of business
is<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.769> now<00:00:10.920> need<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.219> make<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> ground<00:00:11.730> plane<00:00:11.910> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
is we now need to make a ground plane so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.879 
is we now need to make a ground plane so
in<00:00:12.300> order<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.410> either<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.740> of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
in order to do that you can either do of

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.350 
in order to do that you can either do of
two<00:00:14.070> different<00:00:14.400> ways<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.240> up

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
length and width wise and you're going

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
length and width wise and you're going
to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:36.899> big<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.680> seem

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
to make it just as big as you seem

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
to make it just as big as you seem
necessary<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.600> over<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.870> into

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
necessary so if you look over here into

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.299 
necessary so if you look over here into
my<00:00:40.110> render<00:00:40.379> view<00:00:40.500> ah<00:00:41.930> ok<00:00:42.980> that's<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.190> good

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
my render view ah ok that's about good

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.229 
my render view ah ok that's about good
right<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> don't<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.000> need<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
right there you don't really need that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
right there you don't really need that
much<00:00:45.360> alright<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> ground

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
much alright so now we have a ground

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
much alright so now we have a ground
plane<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> next<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> do

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
plane going on next thing we need to do

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.819 
plane going on next thing we need to do
now<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.340> need<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.760> make<00:00:51.090> our<00:00:51.300> model<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.590> for

now is we need to make our model so for

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
now is we need to make our model so for
this<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.160> our<00:00:53.370> model<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> some

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this time our model is going to be some

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.319 
this time our model is going to be some

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
ID so now to create our text we need to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.689 
ID so now to create our text we need to
go<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> our<00:01:00.539> create<00:01:01.020> panel<00:01:01.699> select

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
go up here to our create panel select

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
go up here to our create panel select
text<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.449> select<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> white<00:01:04.080> box<00:01:04.320> that's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.610 
render view so press E or the rotation
tool<00:01:43.000> let's<00:01:44.000> turn<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.420> thing<00:01:44.480> around<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:45.170> want

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
tool let's turn this thing around I want

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.070 
tool let's turn this thing around I want
that<00:01:45.680> somewhat<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.370> an<00:01:46.460> angle<00:01:46.910> so<00:01:47.480> let's<00:01:47.810> see

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
that somewhat of an angle so let's see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.170 
that somewhat of an angle so let's see
here<00:01:49.360> okay<00:01:51.430> little<00:01:52.430> bit<00:01:52.490> bigger<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.760> think

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.930 

that<00:01:56.480> seems<00:01:56.810> pretty<00:01:57.340> okay<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.370> like<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.790> right

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
that seems pretty okay I like it right

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.730 
that seems pretty okay I like it right
there<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.270> looks<00:01:59.480> pretty<00:01:59.660> good<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.500> next

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
there that looks pretty good the next

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.990 
there that looks pretty good the next
thing<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.980> want<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.220> do<00:02:01.340> now<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.820> make<00:02:01.970> sure

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
thing you want to do now is to make sure

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.760 
thing you want to do now is to make sure
your<00:02:02.360> letters<00:02:02.720> aren't<00:02:02.960> actually<00:02:03.500> hitting

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
your letters aren't actually hitting

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.280 
your letters aren't actually hitting
below<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.190> plane<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.000> if<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.630> can<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:05.960> here

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
below the plane so if you can see here

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.499 
below the plane so if you can see here
just<00:02:06.740> barely<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.310> letters<00:02:07.670> are<00:02:07.820> just<00:02:08.149> barely

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
just barely the letters are just barely

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.260 
just barely the letters are just barely
below<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.440> actual<00:02:09.890> plane<00:02:10.250> which<00:02:10.520> real<00:02:11.120> life

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
below the actual plane which real life

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.590 
below the actual plane which real life
is<00:02:11.450> impossible<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.170> let's<00:02:12.530> move<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.430> bit

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.030 

to<00:02:16.050> all<00:02:16.260> them<00:02:16.620> are<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:16.920> nice<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.620> just<00:02:19.620> barely

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
to all them are now nice and just barely

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.840 
to all them are now nice and just barely
hovering<00:02:20.700> above<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.180> plane<00:02:22.610> okay<00:02:23.610> yeah<00:02:23.760> we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
hovering above the plane okay yeah we

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.490 
hovering above the plane okay yeah we
can<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.270> pretty<00:02:24.690> good<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.350> fact

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
can see that's pretty good in fact

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.630 
can see that's pretty good in fact
that's<00:02:25.650> probably<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.040> closest<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.640> get

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.220 

we've<00:02:29.760> done<00:02:29.910> earlier<00:02:30.300> we've<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:31.020> our

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
we've done earlier we've now have our

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.800 
we've done earlier we've now have our
render<00:02:31.530> settings<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.010> ready<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> go<00:02:32.810> mental

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
render settings all ready to go mental

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.809 
render settings all ready to go mental
ray<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.050> all<00:02:34.260> set<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:35.160> let's<00:02:35.400> make<00:02:35.580> some

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
ray is all set now let's make some

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.000 
ray is all set now let's make some
renders<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.590> thing<00:02:37.830> would

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
renders just to see how this thing would

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
renders just to see how this thing would
look<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.400> starting<00:02:38.819> off<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.569> we<00:02:39.840> need<00:02:39.959> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
look like starting off so we need to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.809 
look like starting off so we need to
select<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.500> viewport<00:02:40.920> over<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:41.520> very

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
select a viewport over here that's very

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.940 
select a viewport over here that's very
important<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:43.080> these<00:02:43.200> renders<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.740> course

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
important for these renders of course

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.370 
important for these renders of course
and<00:02:44.190> now<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.760> need<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.180> select<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:46.170> i

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and now you need to select the little i

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.650 
and now you need to select the little i
forget<00:02:47.220> what<00:02:47.310> tool<00:02:47.490> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.880> called<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.450> it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
forget what tool this is called but it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.000 
forget what tool this is called but it
has<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.020> something<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.350> rendering<00:02:49.740> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
has to do something with rendering and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.810 
has to do something with rendering and
the<00:02:50.070> movies<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.240> anyways<00:02:51.750> click<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.110> all<00:02:52.820> right

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
the movies so anyways click it all right

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.570 
the movies so anyways click it all right
then<00:02:54.000> now<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.270> got<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> first<00:02:54.810> render<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.580> for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
then now we got a first render up for

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.949 
then now we got a first render up for
this<00:02:56.670> project<00:02:56.970> we're<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.450> save<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.930> of

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
this project we're going to save all of

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.390 
this project we're going to save all of
our<00:02:58.140> image<00:02:58.380> files<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.830> fact<00:02:59.010> that's<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> do

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
our image files in fact that's what I do

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.510 
our image files in fact that's what I do
every<00:03:00.150> time<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.750> any<00:03:01.110> sort<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.680> 3d<00:03:02.010> project<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
every time I do any sort of 3d project I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.310 
every time I do any sort of 3d project I
had<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.420> need<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.600> create<00:03:03.870> this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
had to do that we need to create this

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.110 
had to do that we need to create this
keep<00:03:04.680> image<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.370> click<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.580> button<00:03:05.820> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
keep image so just click that button and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.030 
keep image so just click that button and
boom<00:03:06.420> there<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.560> creates<00:03:07.860> an

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
boom there you go now it creates an

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.699 
boom there you go now it creates an
instance<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.269> current<00:03:09.570> frame<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.530> in

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
instance of the current frame and one in

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.400 
instance of the current frame and one in
the<00:03:10.769> past<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:12.090> you're<00:03:12.780> looking<00:03:13.140> at<00:03:13.230> this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the past so if you're looking at this

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.479 
the past so if you're looking at this
and<00:03:13.590> you're<00:03:13.709> wondering<00:03:13.860> well<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.340> heck

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
and you're wondering well what the heck

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.800 
and you're wondering well what the heck
is<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.239> know<00:03:15.330> everything's<00:03:15.690> on

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
is going on you know everything's on

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110 
is going on you know everything's on
black<00:03:16.080> well<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.830> I've<00:03:16.980> done<00:03:17.100> earlier<00:03:17.489> we

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
black well like I've done earlier we

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.930 
black well like I've done earlier we
deleted<00:03:18.540> our<00:03:18.780> default<00:03:19.200> light<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.550> we<00:03:20.580> didn't

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
deleted our default light so we didn't

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.820 
deleted our default light so we didn't
really<00:03:20.970> need<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.450> at<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.170> if<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.650> turn

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
really need that at all and if we turn

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.380 
really need that at all and if we turn
back<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:23.070> default<00:03:23.489> light<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.030> render<00:03:24.360> it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
back on default light and render it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.910 
back on default light and render it
we're<00:03:25.140> going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> see<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> little<00:03:25.800> bit

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
we're going to see a little bit

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.740 
we're going to see a little bit
something<00:03:26.160> different<00:03:26.580> see<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.480> want<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
something different see but you want to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
something different see but you want to
make<00:03:27.840> sure<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.290> enabled<00:03:28.680> default<00:03:29.130> light

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
make sure you have enabled default light

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.710

our own lights first thing we need to do

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.630 
our own lights first thing we need to do
is<00:03:32.910> create<00:03:33.810> some<00:03:34.019> lights<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:35.070> let's<00:03:35.459> just

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
is create some lights so let's just

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.780 
is create some lights so let's just
create<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.120> spotlight<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:38.459> better<00:03:38.670> yet

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
create a spotlight or better yet

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.759 
create a spotlight or better yet
actually<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.390> create<00:03:39.600> an<00:03:39.660> area<00:03:39.989> light<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.440> go

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
actually is create an area light so go

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.500 
actually is create an area light so go
over<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> spotlight<00:03:41.310> attributes<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
over here to spotlight attributes and of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.490 
over here to spotlight attributes and of
course<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.810> guys<00:03:42.870> already<00:03:43.049> know<00:03:43.170> how<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.320> do

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
course you guys already know how to do

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.340 
course you guys already know how to do
this<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.890> let's<00:03:43.970> make<00:03:44.970> an<00:03:45.090> area<00:03:45.239> light<00:03:45.510> move

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
this and let's make an area light move

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.530 
this and let's make an area light move
it<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.709> let's<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.579> move<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.060> guy<00:03:48.360> around

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it up let's see move this guy around

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.420 
it up let's see move this guy around
manipulate<00:03:49.350> your<00:03:49.410> tool<00:03:49.620> up<00:03:49.829> up<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.160> up<00:03:50.750> okay

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
manipulate your tool up up up up okay

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.860 
manipulate your tool up up up up okay
they<00:03:53.670> lighting<00:03:54.090> for<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.269> scene<00:03:54.569> is<00:03:54.810> somewhat

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
they lighting for the scene is somewhat

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.030 
they lighting for the scene is somewhat
everywhere<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:58.500> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.799> bit

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
everywhere so this is going to be a bit

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.259 
everywhere so this is going to be a bit
more<00:03:59.069> difficult<00:03:59.219> agreeable<00:04:00.030> we'll<00:04:00.180> go

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
more difficult agreeable we'll go

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.000 
more difficult agreeable we'll go
through<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.540> pretty<00:04:00.750> easy<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.530> right<00:04:01.890> now

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
through it pretty easy all right now

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.990 
through it pretty easy all right now
let's<00:04:02.219> check<00:04:02.340> out<00:04:02.519> what<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.790> would<00:04:02.969> look

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
let's check out what this would look

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780 
let's check out what this would look
like

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.580 

alright<00:04:07.269> now<00:04:07.480> we'll<00:04:07.540> save<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.079> but<00:04:08.379> at<00:04:08.469> least

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
alright now we'll save it but at least

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.619 
alright now we'll save it but at least
there's<00:04:08.829> somewhat<00:04:09.159> of<00:04:09.159> an<00:04:09.340> improvement<00:04:09.640> one

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
there's somewhat of an improvement one

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.729 
there's somewhat of an improvement one
thing<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.900> want<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.170> notice<00:04:11.439> right<00:04:11.590> now

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
thing you want to notice right now

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.709 
thing you want to notice right now
there's<00:04:12.489> no<00:04:12.730> shadows<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.359> let's<00:04:13.540> enable

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
there's no shadows so let's enable

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.670 
there's no shadows so let's enable
shadows<00:04:14.200> for<00:04:14.349> this<00:04:14.469> light<00:04:14.790> select<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.530> go<00:04:17.530> down

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
shadows for this light select it go down

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.629 
shadows for this light select it go down
to<00:04:18.449> shadows<00:04:19.449> right<00:04:19.720> here<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:21.310> want<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.549> use

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
to shadows right here you want to use

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.490 
to shadows right here you want to use
raytrace<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.419> doze<00:04:22.630> let's<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.110> keep<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.380> at

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
raytrace a doze let's just keep it at

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.650 
raytrace a doze let's just keep it at
one<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.009> one<00:04:24.669> right<00:04:24.940> now<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.389> shadow

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
one and one right now for the shadow

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.409 
one and one right now for the shadow
raise<00:04:25.870> an<00:04:26.020> array<00:04:26.229> damp<00:04:26.440> limit<00:04:27.150> mounts<00:04:28.150> render

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
raise an array damp limit mounts render

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.559 
raise an array damp limit mounts render
again

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.679 

okay<00:04:32.529> so<00:04:32.589> far<00:04:33.009> so<00:04:33.069> good<00:04:33.279> we<00:04:33.639> got<00:04:33.789> some<00:04:34.270> shadows

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
okay so far so good we got some shadows

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.689 
okay so far so good we got some shadows
at<00:04:34.809> least<00:04:34.960> going<00:04:35.199> on<00:04:35.379> if<00:04:36.369> you're<00:04:36.550> wondering

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
at least going on if you're wondering

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.159 
at least going on if you're wondering
right<00:04:36.879> now<00:04:36.939> what<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:37.569> all<00:04:37.779> that<00:04:37.809> little

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
right now what is all that little

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.040 
right now what is all that little
graininess<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:39.699> is<00:04:39.909> because<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.330> shadow<00:04:40.689> is

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
graininess that is because the shadow is

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.439 
graininess that is because the shadow is
only<00:04:41.319> using<00:04:41.559> one<00:04:41.679> array<00:04:42.129> so<00:04:42.520> let's<00:04:42.999> bump<00:04:43.240> that

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
only using one array so let's bump that

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.650 
only using one array so let's bump that
up<00:04:43.479> to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
up to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.020 

so<00:04:46.320> let's<00:04:46.530> see<00:04:46.740> let's<00:04:47.160> use<00:04:47.430> about<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:47.940> don't

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
so let's see let's use about I don't

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.480 
so let's see let's use about I don't
know<00:04:48.210> let's<00:04:49.020> set<00:04:49.170> it<00:04:49.200> at<00:04:49.350> 30<00:04:49.710> just<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> start

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
know let's set it at 30 just to start

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.879 
know let's set it at 30 just to start
off<00:04:50.990> now<00:04:51.990> let's<00:04:52.200> go<00:04:52.320> for<00:04:52.530> another<00:04:52.590> render

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
off now let's go for another render

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.929 
off now let's go for another render
much<00:04:55.370> better<00:04:55.819> much<00:04:56.449> much<00:04:56.810> softer<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:58.699> can

00:04:58.929 --> 00:04:58.939 
much better much much softer you can

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:00.999 
much better much much softer you can
alternatively<00:04:59.569> have<00:04:59.930> like<00:05:00.169> a<00:05:00.199> hundred<00:05:00.590> raised

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
alternatively have like a hundred raised

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.610 
alternatively have like a hundred raised
in<00:05:01.370> your<00:05:01.759> render<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.599> won't<00:05:02.780> really<00:05:03.199> speed<00:05:03.590> up

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
in your render it won't really speed up

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.529 
in your render it won't really speed up
the<00:05:03.800> process<00:05:03.949> a<00:05:04.249> whole<00:05:04.580> lot<00:05:04.819> unless<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.449> have

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
the process a whole lot unless you have

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.570 
the process a whole lot unless you have
a<00:05:05.569> huge<00:05:05.960> amount<00:05:06.229> of<00:05:06.259> things<00:05:06.439> going<00:05:06.710> on<00:05:06.860> but

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
a huge amount of things going on but

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.309 
a huge amount of things going on but
since<00:05:07.849> we'll<00:05:08.029> be<00:05:08.060> using<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.629> bunch<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.110> lights

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
since we'll be using a bunch of lights

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.689 
since we'll be using a bunch of lights
in<00:05:09.469> the<00:05:09.590> scene<00:05:09.830> because<00:05:10.129> the<00:05:10.219> light<00:05:10.430> isn't

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
in the scene because the light isn't

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.529 
in the scene because the light isn't
really<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.569> one<00:05:11.810> place<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.409> will<00:05:13.210> keep<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.389> at<00:05:14.509> a

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
really in one place it will keep it at a

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.019 
really in one place it will keep it at a
low<00:05:14.719> somewhere<00:05:15.169> in<00:05:15.289> between<00:05:15.469> 30<00:05:16.129> and<00:05:16.249> 60<00:05:16.789> I

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
low somewhere in between 30 and 60 I

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.989 
low somewhere in between 30 and 60 I
let's<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.930> keep<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.199> image<00:05:18.409> see<00:05:19.279> that<00:05:19.460> little

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
let's to keep that image see that little

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.820 
let's to keep that image see that little
by<00:05:20.180> little<00:05:20.210> we<00:05:20.479> got<00:05:20.509> improvement<00:05:20.990> okay<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:21.650> now

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
by little we got improvement okay so now

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.469 
by little we got improvement okay so now
we<00:05:21.919> more<00:05:22.219> or<00:05:22.249> less<00:05:22.490> have<00:05:22.789> some<00:05:23.150> form<00:05:23.389> of

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
we more or less have some form of

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.929 
we more or less have some form of
lighting<00:05:24.050> now<00:05:24.800> what<00:05:25.069> we<00:05:25.279> have<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.490> do<00:05:25.699> is<00:05:25.819> we

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
lighting now what we have to do is we

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.909 
lighting now what we have to do is we
have<00:05:26.029> to<00:05:26.120> make<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.240> ground<00:05:26.599> plane<00:05:26.840> here<00:05:27.319> use<00:05:27.710> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
have to make a ground plane here use the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.589 
have to make a ground plane here use the
background<00:05:28.129> and<00:05:28.550> that's<00:05:28.789> very<00:05:29.060> easy<00:05:29.150> we<00:05:29.569> just

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
background and that's very easy we just

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.879 
background and that's very easy we just
select<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.110> ground<00:05:30.319> plane<00:05:30.529> here<00:05:30.710> in<00:05:30.800> our

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
select the ground plane here in our

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.379 
select the ground plane here in our
perspective<00:05:31.370> view<00:05:31.460> or<00:05:31.639> in<00:05:31.969> a<00:05:32.000> render<00:05:32.270> view

mouse button down and assign new
material<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:37.250> can<00:05:37.400> also<00:05:37.550> use<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.789> hypergraph

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
material you can also use a hypergraph

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.089 
material you can also use a hypergraph
of<00:05:38.569> course<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:39.020> you'd<00:05:39.139> like<00:05:39.289> whatever<00:05:40.009> you

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
of course if you'd like whatever you

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.119 
of course if you'd like whatever you
call<00:05:40.219> it<00:05:40.279> go<00:05:41.060> down<00:05:41.240> over<00:05:41.599> here<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:42.169> Maya<00:05:42.620> under

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
call it go down over here to Maya under

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.589 
call it go down over here to Maya under
favorites<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.789> now<00:05:44.240> what<00:05:44.330> you're<00:05:44.389> going<00:05:44.509> to

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
favorites and now what you're going to

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.640 
favorites and now what you're going to
do<00:05:44.659> is<00:05:44.750> you're<00:05:44.840> going<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.020> select<00:05:45.169> use

do is you're going to select use

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.369 
do is you're going to select use
background<00:05:46.250> okay<00:05:46.759> so<00:05:47.719> now<00:05:47.839> let's<00:05:47.870> just<00:05:48.139> render

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
background okay so now let's just render

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.300 
background okay so now let's just render
this<00:05:48.529> see<00:05:49.310> what<00:05:49.400> that<00:05:49.430> looks<00:05:49.550> like<00:05:51.159> okay<00:05:52.159> we

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
this see what that looks like okay we

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.309 
this see what that looks like okay we
got<00:05:52.339> some<00:05:52.639> reflectiveness<00:05:53.150> but<00:05:53.449> wow<00:05:53.749> already

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
got some reflectiveness but wow already

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.439 
got some reflectiveness but wow already
that<00:05:54.620> looks<00:05:54.800> pretty<00:05:55.009> good<00:05:55.279> so<00:05:55.490> let's<00:05:56.210> save

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
that looks pretty good so let's save

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.879 
that looks pretty good so let's save
that<00:05:56.479> image<00:05:56.749> and<00:05:57.080> we<00:05:57.229> need<00:05:57.349> to<00:05:57.439> bump<00:05:57.620> down<00:05:57.740> the

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
that image and we need to bump down the

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.589 
that image and we need to bump down the
reflectiveness<00:05:58.370> since<00:05:58.789> this<00:05:59.029> automatically

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
reflectiveness since this automatically

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.439 
reflectiveness since this automatically
comes<00:05:59.810> with<00:05:59.960> reflectivity<00:06:00.759> okay<00:06:01.759> go<00:06:02.330> over

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
comes with reflectivity okay go over

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.749 
comes with reflectivity okay go over
here<00:06:02.569> to<00:06:02.629> use<00:06:02.960> background<00:06:03.379> 10<00:06:03.800> why<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.610> heck

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
here to use background 10 why the heck

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.189 
here to use background 10 why the heck
am<00:06:04.789> I<00:06:04.909> telling<00:06:05.120> you<00:06:05.210> guys<00:06:05.479> is<00:06:05.659> you<00:06:05.990> already

am I telling you guys is you already
know<00:06:06.409> how<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.589> use<00:06:06.680> Maya<00:06:06.979> or<00:06:07.580> else<00:06:07.729> you

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819 
know how to use Maya or else you

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.059 
know how to use Maya or else you
wouldn't<00:06:08.000> even<00:06:08.120> watching<00:06:08.629> this<00:06:08.949> bump<00:06:09.949> down

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
wouldn't even watching this bump down

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.709 
wouldn't even watching this bump down
the<00:06:10.189> reflectivity<00:06:10.669> to<00:06:10.909> absolute<00:06:11.569> zero

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
the reflectivity to absolute zero

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.800 
the reflectivity to absolute zero
reflection<00:06:12.649> limit<00:06:12.979> put<00:06:13.729> that<00:06:13.849> 20<00:06:14.060> as<00:06:14.360> well<00:06:14.569> you

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
reflection limit put that 20 as well you

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.450 
reflection limit put that 20 as well you
don't<00:06:14.960> really<00:06:15.080> need<00:06:15.259> it<00:06:15.409> now<00:06:15.860> let's<00:06:16.099> render<00:06:16.310> it

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
don't really need it now let's render it

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.079 
don't really need it now let's render it
one<00:06:16.759> more<00:06:16.909> time<00:06:17.589> very<00:06:18.589> nice<00:06:18.949> I<00:06:19.219> really<00:06:19.909> like

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:20.089 
one more time very nice I really like

one more time very nice I really like
that<00:06:20.300> that<00:06:20.509> looks<00:06:20.750> great<00:06:21.399> now<00:06:22.399> let's<00:06:22.610> tweak

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:22.939 
that that looks great now let's tweak

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.850 
that that looks great now let's tweak
around<00:06:23.060> some<00:06:23.419> of<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:23.569> materials<00:06:24.080> what<00:06:24.740> we're

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
around some of the materials what we're

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.079 
around some of the materials what we're
going<00:06:24.949> to<00:06:25.039> use<00:06:25.099> this<00:06:25.370> time<00:06:25.610> is<00:06:25.789> going<00:06:25.939> to<00:06:26.000> be

right here select glossy plastic and now

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.100 
right here select glossy plastic and now
you're<00:06:54.530> going<00:06:54.650> to<00:06:54.710> select<00:06:54.860> replace<00:06:55.990> all<00:06:56.990> right

you're going to select replace all right
then<00:06:57.290> now<00:06:57.410> let's<00:06:57.590> just<00:06:57.710> do<00:06:57.830> a<00:06:57.860> quick<00:06:58.130> little

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
then now let's just do a quick little

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.790 
then now let's just do a quick little
render<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.730> see<00:06:58.880> what<00:06:59.000> it<00:06:59.090> looks<00:06:59.240> like<00:06:59.800> alright

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
render to see what it looks like alright

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.490 
render to see what it looks like alright
then<00:07:01.010> so<00:07:01.910> far<00:07:02.150> that's<00:07:02.540> what<00:07:02.780> it<00:07:02.870> looks<00:07:03.050> like<00:07:03.230> in

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
then so far that's what it looks like in

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.730 
then so far that's what it looks like in
a<00:07:04.310> nutshell<00:07:04.960> so<00:07:05.960> now<00:07:06.080> let's<00:07:06.290> finally<00:07:06.590> get

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
a nutshell so now let's finally get

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.050 
a nutshell so now let's finally get
things<00:07:07.010> going<00:07:07.340> along<00:07:07.580> smoothly

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.070 

alright<00:07:10.180> so<00:07:10.300> basically<00:07:10.450> now<00:07:10.780> you<00:07:10.840> have

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
alright so basically now you have

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.200 
alright so basically now you have
everything<00:07:11.440> already<00:07:11.770> in<00:07:12.130> set<00:07:12.400> up<00:07:12.550> the<00:07:13.060> only

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
everything already in set up the only

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.790 
everything already in set up the only
thing<00:07:13.360> you<00:07:13.450> need<00:07:13.600> to<00:07:13.630> do<00:07:13.840> now<00:07:14.020> is<00:07:14.050> just<00:07:14.290> find

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
thing you need to do now is just find

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.560 
thing you need to do now is just find
the<00:07:14.919> balance<00:07:15.130> between<00:07:15.340> your<00:07:15.700> materials<00:07:16.360> and

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
the balance between your materials and

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.960 
the balance between your materials and
your<00:07:16.780> lighting<00:07:17.440> and<00:07:17.710> your<00:07:18.370> ground<00:07:18.610> plane<00:07:18.820> and

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
your lighting and your ground plane and

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.210 
your lighting and your ground plane and
things<00:07:19.180> like<00:07:19.360> that<00:07:19.419> from<00:07:20.290> here<00:07:20.500> on<00:07:20.560> now<00:07:20.860> this

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
things like that from here on now this

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.460 
things like that from here on now this
is<00:07:21.370> a<00:07:21.400> very<00:07:21.490> sort<00:07:22.030> of<00:07:22.120> personal<00:07:22.990> way<00:07:23.139> you<00:07:23.200> could

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
is a very sort of personal way you could

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.900 
is a very sort of personal way you could
see<00:07:23.650> to<00:07:23.770> your<00:07:23.800> scene<00:07:24.190> because<00:07:24.580> now<00:07:24.760> you<00:07:24.820> have

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
see to your scene because now you have

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.640 
see to your scene because now you have
everything<00:07:25.240> all<00:07:25.510> set<00:07:25.750> up<00:07:25.870> so<00:07:26.080> I'm<00:07:26.440> going<00:07:26.590> to

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
everything all set up so I'm going to

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.770 
everything all set up so I'm going to
speed<00:07:27.070> up<00:07:27.190> this<00:07:27.400> footage<00:07:27.820> just<00:07:28.480> so<00:07:28.630> you<00:07:28.690> can

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
speed up this footage just so you can

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.470 
speed up this footage just so you can
have<00:07:29.080> an<00:07:29.169> idea<00:07:29.500> how<00:07:30.070> my<00:07:30.430> specific<00:07:31.150> scene<00:07:31.330> will

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480 
have an idea how my specific scene will

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.750 
have an idea how my specific scene will
go<00:07:31.600> along<00:07:31.960> with<00:07:32.320> this<00:07:32.889> lighting<00:07:33.460> how<00:07:33.580> it's<00:07:33.700> a

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
go along with this lighting how it's a

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.790 
go along with this lighting how it's a
little<00:07:33.790> bit<00:07:34.180> advanced<00:07:34.620> considering<00:07:35.620> there's

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
little bit advanced considering there's

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.520 
little bit advanced considering there's
no<00:07:35.980> significant<00:07:36.669> source<00:07:37.030> my<00:07:37.780> materials<00:07:38.410> I

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530 
no significant source my materials I

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.010 
no significant source my materials I
want<00:07:38.740> to<00:07:38.860> make<00:07:38.980> it<00:07:39.130> somewhat<00:07:40.060> at<00:07:40.300> least<00:07:40.600> shiny

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 
want to make it somewhat at least shiny

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.230 
want to make it somewhat at least shiny
but<00:07:41.380> a<00:07:41.410> little<00:07:41.710> bit<00:07:41.830> realistic<00:07:42.160> if<00:07:42.580> I<00:07:42.760> can<00:07:43.030> as

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 
but a little bit realistic if I can as

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.129 
but a little bit realistic if I can as
well<00:07:43.350> so<00:07:44.350> sit<00:07:44.740> back<00:07:44.770> and<00:07:45.340> watch<00:07:46.030> and<00:07:46.419> remember

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:47.139 
well so sit back and watch and remember

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:48.990 
well so sit back and watch and remember
a<00:07:47.410> lot<00:07:47.650> of<00:07:47.710> the<00:07:47.830> techniques<00:07:48.250> i'm<00:07:48.460> going<00:07:48.760> to<00:07:48.850> use

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 
a lot of the techniques i'm going to use

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.879 
a lot of the techniques i'm going to use
right<00:07:49.240> now<00:07:49.270> can<00:07:49.930> definitely<00:07:50.470> and<00:07:50.650> probably

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:50.889 
right now can definitely and probably

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.980 
right now can definitely and probably
will<00:07:51.220> be<00:07:51.400> applied<00:07:51.700> to<00:07:51.880> your<00:07:51.940> scene<00:07:52.270> so<00:07:52.810> make
