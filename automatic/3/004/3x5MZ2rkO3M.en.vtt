00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and closer to the playoffs so we can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
and closer to the playoffs so we can
arrange<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:58.860> cards<00:01:59.189> how<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.700> or<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.090> can

arrange our cards how we like or we can

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
arrange our cards how we like or we can
just<00:02:00.270> shuffle<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.990> depending<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.560> your

just shuffle them up depending on your

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.359 
just shuffle them up depending on your
strategy<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.899> then<00:02:03.899> after<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.950> complete

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
strategy and then after this is complete

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.479 
strategy and then after this is complete
we<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.969> start<00:02:06.210> competing<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.770> matches

defending player starts with one point

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
defending player starts with one point
giving<00:02:17.760> them<00:02:17.910> an<00:02:18.060> advantage<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.600> being

giving them an advantage for being

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.160 
giving them an advantage for being
attacked<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.430> only<00:02:20.700> other<00:02:20.730> rule<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.870> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
attacked the only other rule is that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.280 
attacked the only other rule is that
goalies<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.820> block<00:02:24.180> any<00:02:24.390> shot<00:02:24.840> against

them and if a goalie meets a goalie the
higher<00:02:27.300> numbered<00:02:27.660> goalie<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:28.530> score<00:02:28.830> a

higher numbered goalie will score a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.460 
higher numbered goalie will score a
point<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.060> case<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.600> have<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.200> my

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
point so in this case I have a to my

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.440 
point so in this case I have a to my
opponent<00:02:31.860> has<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> point<00:02:33.330> for

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
opponent has a one I get a point for

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.080 
opponent has a one I get a point for
that<00:02:33.630> round<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.150> 11<00:02:37.250> after<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.940> move

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that round so now it is 11 after we move

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.730 
that round so now it is 11 after we move
those<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> side<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:40.050> move<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.710> next

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
those to the side we move on to the next

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.550 
those to the side we move on to the next
card<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.840> will<00:02:43.050> continue<00:02:43.350> until

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
card and so on this will continue until

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.760 
card and so on this will continue until
we've<00:02:44.400> played<00:02:44.610> all<00:02:44.640> six<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.150> our<00:02:45.300> cards<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.960> as

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
we've played all six of our cards and as

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.080 
we've played all six of our cards and as
you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.070> see<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.310> we're<00:02:47.430> evenly<00:02:47.700> matched<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you can see if we're evenly matched that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
you can see if we're evenly matched that
does<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.660> score<00:02:48.930> any<00:02:49.110> points<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.470> either

does not score any points for either

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.410 
does not score any points for either
player<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.640> continue<00:02:51.030> until<00:02:51.240> we've

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
