00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
don't think Tom of that and the things

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.770 
don't think Tom of that and the things
that<00:01:35.770> could<00:01:35.890> go<00:01:35.950> go<00:01:36.280> against<00:01:36.610> him<00:01:36.730> then<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.030> in

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
that could go go against him then and in

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.390 
that could go go against him then and in
my<00:01:37.960> pjs<00:01:38.260> in<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.440> top<00:01:38.620> three<00:01:38.890> players<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
my pjs in the top three players in the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.680 
my pjs in the top three players in the
bracket<00:01:39.700> pro<00:01:39.850> league<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.240> think<00:01:40.300> here's<00:01:40.630> a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
bracket pro league so I think here's a

bracket pro league so I think here's a
chance<00:01:40.930> but<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.740> things<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.250> don't<00:01:42.520> think

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
chance but the things that I don't think

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.550 
chance but the things that I don't think

anything and the thing that could go get

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.800 
anything and the thing that could go get

to know he's no in the public eye as

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.950 
to know he's no in the public eye as
much<00:02:58.990> as<00:02:59.110> some<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> other<00:02:59.770> nominees<00:02:59.950> and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
much as some of the other nominees and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.510 
much as some of the other nominees and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
might Suarez he's in there for the wrong

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.410 
might Suarez he's in there for the wrong
reasons<00:03:05.380> began<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> him<00:03:05.980> later<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.420> obviously

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420

meet<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.990> is<00:03:08.230> ugly<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.010> played<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:09.760> had<00:03:10.330> a

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
meet you is ugly but played it or had a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.420 
meet you is ugly but played it or had a
better<00:03:10.600> season<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.590> don't<00:03:12.070> agree<00:03:12.340> with

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
better season but I don't agree with

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.310 
better season but I don't agree with
that<00:03:12.580> I'm<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.270> eric<00:03:13.540> has<00:03:13.930> been<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.170> very

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
that I'm I think eric has been a very

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.410 
that I'm I think eric has been a very
good<00:03:14.620> player<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.010> his<00:03:15.580> consistency<00:03:16.090> could<00:03:16.330> be

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
good player and his consistency could be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.030 
good player and his consistency could be
a<00:03:16.450> factor<00:03:16.690> because<00:03:17.050> he'd<00:03:17.380> been<00:03:17.410> making<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.920> one

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
a factor because he'd been making it one

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.650 
a factor because he'd been making it one
of<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.160> most<00:03:18.190> consistent<00:03:18.520> players<00:03:18.940> but

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
of the most consistent players but

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.050 
of the most consistent players but
surely<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.890> means<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.430> Dembele<00:03:21.820> and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
surely that means that Dembele and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.190 
surely that means that Dembele and
Arteta<00:03:22.360> should<00:03:22.570> have<00:03:22.660> been<00:03:22.750> over<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.960> shout

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
Arteta should have been over the shout

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.450 
Arteta should have been over the shout
as<00:03:23.320> well<00:03:23.470> cuz<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:23.740> better<00:03:23.920> he's<00:03:24.100> been<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.280> of

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
as well cuz then better he's been one of

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.070 
as well cuz then better he's been one of
the<00:03:24.580> best<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:24.940> was<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.300> league<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.630> my

impressive<00:03:57.160> debut<00:03:57.400> season<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.090> but<00:03:59.020> then

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
impressive debut season and but then

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.500 
impressive debut season and but then
again<00:03:59.320> same<00:03:59.800> works<00:04:00.070> at<00:04:00.280> bail<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.820> if<00:04:01.120> he's<00:04:01.360> not

on the ball he's not very impressive

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.160

compared<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.210> some<00:04:05.020> of<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.110> other

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
compared to some of the other

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.260 
compared to some of the other
competitors<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.920> consistent<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.820> be<00:04:06.970> factory

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
competitors is consistent can be factory

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.260 
competitors is consistent can be factory
did<00:04:07.420> go<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.570> bit<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.230> dry<00:04:08.710> spell<00:04:08.740> and<00:04:09.270> finally

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
did go a bit of a dry spell and finally

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.480 
did go a bit of a dry spell and finally
I<00:04:10.450> think<00:04:10.930> matter<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.410> more<00:04:11.590> deserving<00:04:11.860> so

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
I think matter is more deserving so

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.730 
I think matter is more deserving so
we're<00:04:12.760> gonna<00:04:12.940> go<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.570> next<00:04:13.740> candidate

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
we're gonna go on to the next candidate

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.680 
we're gonna go on to the next candidate
and<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.040> gonna<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.430> one<00:04:15.640> matter<00:04:15.850> he's<00:04:16.299> 24

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
and that is gonna be one matter he's 24

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.330 
and that is gonna be one matter he's 24
years<00:04:16.720> old<00:04:16.989> he<00:04:17.350> also<00:04:17.530> plays<00:04:17.830> with<00:04:17.980> Chelsea's
