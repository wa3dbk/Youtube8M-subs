00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
DJ tech tools provides a lot of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.370 
DJ tech tools provides a lot of
different<00:00:30.840> mappings<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.099> controller

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
different mappings for this controller

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.389 
different mappings for this controller
you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.649> either<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.010> standard

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you can use either their standard

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.889 
you can use either their standard
mapping<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.210> use<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.450> own<00:00:36.600> mapping

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
mapping you can use your own mapping

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
mapping you can use your own mapping
there's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> community<00:00:38.370> mappings<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
there's a lot of community mappings for

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.319 
there's a lot of community mappings for
it<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
it so what you can really do with it is

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.690 
it so what you can really do with it is
is<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.110> unlike<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> controller<00:00:44.640> like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
is up to you unlike a controller like

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
is up to you unlike a controller like
the<00:00:45.000> tractor<00:00:45.510> f1<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.500> no<00:00:46.620> labels

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

the tractor f1 here if there's no labels
here<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> buttons<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.360> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
here on any of the buttons and it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.029 
here on any of the buttons and it's
really<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> work

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
this into your routine the buttons are

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.490 
this into your routine the buttons are
so<00:00:53.010> solid<00:00:53.520> feeling<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.809> compare<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so solid feeling so even compare it to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
so solid feeling so even compare it to
something<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> pads<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.149> f1

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
something like the pads on them on f1

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.619 
something like the pads on them on f1
the<00:00:58.710> pads<00:00:59.190> feel<00:00:59.460> even<00:00:59.760> better<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the pads feel even better or are the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
the pads feel even better or are the
buttons<00:01:00.899> feel<00:01:01.050> even<00:01:01.320> better<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.680> they

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
buttons feel even better because they

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.619 
buttons feel even better because they
just<00:01:02.129> spring<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.730> place<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> quickly

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
just spring back into place so quickly

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
just spring back into place so quickly
and<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.650> play<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.460> real

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and you can play them like a real

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.289 
and you can play them like a real
instrument<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.220> far<00:01:09.000> cry<00:01:09.210> from

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
instrument which is just a far cry from

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030 
instrument which is just a far cry from
what<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.869> them<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> buttons<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> like

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what you get them on the buttons on like

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.620 
what you get them on the buttons on like
a<00:01:11.070> nest<00:01:11.280> tour<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> asks<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:11.970> where<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.450> much

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a nest tour and asks for where it's much

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
a nest tour and asks for where it's much
more<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> gummy<00:01:13.740> feeling<00:01:15.950> definitely

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
more like a gummy feeling definitely

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
more like a gummy feeling definitely
recommend<00:01:17.610> trying<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> interesting

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
recommend trying out the interesting

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.469 
recommend trying out the interesting
gratification<00:01:19.110> mapping<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.479> considering

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
gratification mapping for it considering

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
gratification mapping for it considering
it<00:01:21.600> comes<00:01:21.780> normally<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.470> banks

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it comes normally with the four banks

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.490 
it comes normally with the four banks
one<00:01:22.979> lots<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> tutorials<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
one lots of tutorials and how to do that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
one lots of tutorials and how to do that
in<00:01:25.799> terms<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> build<00:01:26.640> quality<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in terms of build quality it's it is

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.700 
in terms of build quality it's it is
expensive<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.090> $180<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.350> expect

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
expensive so for $180 you kind of expect

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
expensive so for $180 you kind of expect
build<00:01:31.950> quality<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.509> bit<00:01:33.659> better

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
build quality to be a little bit better

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
build quality to be a little bit better
than<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.320> oh<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> silicone<00:01:35.820> case

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
than it is oh I got the silicone case

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
than it is oh I got the silicone case
for<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.810> gives<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.829> sturdy

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
for it so that gives it a more sturdy

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.160 
for it so that gives it a more sturdy
feel<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.090> otherwise<00:01:39.360> you've<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
feel but otherwise you've just got a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
feel but otherwise you've just got a
plexiglass<00:01:40.890> top<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.820> plexiglass<00:01:42.390> bottom

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
plexiglass top and a plexiglass bottom

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.210 
plexiglass top and a plexiglass bottom
and<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.820> screws<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:46.740> standoffs

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and some some screws and some standoffs

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.120 
and some some screws and some standoffs
holding<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.939> place<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.920> most

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
holding it in place so it's not the most

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
holding it in place so it's not the most
sturdy<00:01:50.460> thing<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> world<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
sturdy thing in the world that's that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.780 
sturdy thing in the world that's that
the<00:01:53.250> connector<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.000> USB<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:55.790> it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the connector for USB is pretty it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580 
the connector for USB is pretty it's
pretty<00:01:57.030> secure<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.750> don't<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.469> going

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
pretty secure I don't think it's going

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
pretty secure I don't think it's going
to<00:01:58.619> come<00:01:58.829> loose<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.189> its<00:01:59.340> own<00:01:59.460> accord<00:01:59.729> any<00:01:59.969> time

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
to come loose of its own accord any time

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
to come loose of its own accord any time

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
soon but I definitely would recommend

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
soon but I definitely would recommend
getting<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> silicone<00:02:05.880> case<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.509> have

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
getting the silicone case because I have

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
getting the silicone case because I have
no<00:02:06.899> idea<00:02:07.229> how<00:02:07.469> people<00:02:07.649> plan<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.280> gig<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
no idea how people plan to gig with it

with at least having that little bit of

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.110 
with at least having that little bit of
protection<00:02:10.890> around<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> side

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.280 

also<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> cable<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.629> provide<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.049> pretty

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
also the cable they provide is pretty

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.129 
also the cable they provide is pretty
good<00:02:16.499> but<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.969> you<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.359> something<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:19.109> a

good but I if you want something with a
heavy<00:02:19.409> braid<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.249> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.489> bit

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
heavy braid on it that's a little bit

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.420 
heavy braid on it that's a little bit
better<00:02:21.030> shielded<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:22.439> last<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:23.010> lot<00:02:23.370> longer

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
better shielded the last a lot longer

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.489 
better shielded the last a lot longer
and<00:02:24.030> looks<00:02:24.359> pretty<00:02:24.599> cool<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.049> can<00:02:25.079> pick<00:02:25.349> up

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
compared to a pre napped controller and

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.069 
compared to a pre napped controller and
it's<00:02:44.280> great<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:45.209> able<00:02:45.389> to<00:02:45.450> support<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.959> small

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of companies so if you're into heavy

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.599 
of companies so if you're into heavy
heavy<00:03:01.019> manipulation<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.829> your<00:03:01.949> tracks<00:03:02.280> not

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
heavy manipulation of your tracks not

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.439 
heavy manipulation of your tracks not
just<00:03:02.879> queueing<00:03:04.699> everything<00:03:05.699> from<00:03:05.879> time-delay

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
just queueing everything from time-delay

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.470 
just queueing everything from time-delay
to<00:03:06.780> various<00:03:07.199> effects<00:03:07.879> this<00:03:08.879> definitely<00:03:09.299> is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
to various effects this definitely is

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.839 
to various effects this definitely is
the<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.139> go<00:03:10.409> in<00:03:10.709> terms<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.519> terms<00:03:11.579> of

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
the way to go in terms of in terms of

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.280 
the way to go in terms of in terms of
custom<00:03:12.180> mappings<00:03:12.569> in<00:03:12.659> terms<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.079> pre-built

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
custom mappings in terms of pre-built

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.679 
custom mappings in terms of pre-built
ones<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.189> can<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.430> manipulate<00:03:15.419> and

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
ones because you can just manipulate and

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.990 
ones because you can just manipulate and
play<00:03:16.049> with<00:03:16.259> tracks<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.889> ways<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.310> really

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
play with tracks and ways that really

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
play with tracks and ways that really
aren't<00:03:18.150> comfortable<00:03:18.509> or<00:03:19.079> possible<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.129> other

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
aren't comfortable or possible on other

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.149 
aren't comfortable or possible on other
controllers<00:03:20.879> just<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:21.479> of<00:03:22.009> how<00:03:23.009> much

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
controllers just because of how much

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.369 
controllers just because of how much
tactility<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.389> response<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.959> get<00:03:25.079> out<00:03:25.229> of

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
tactility and response you get out of

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.069 
tactility and response you get out of
these<00:03:25.500> buttons<00:03:25.919> so<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.879> hope<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.479> give<00:03:27.989> you

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
these buttons so I hope that give you

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.289 
these buttons so I hope that give you
guys<00:03:28.259> some<00:03:28.949> idea<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.489> what<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.819> controller<00:03:30.150> is

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
guys some idea of what the controller is

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.590 
guys some idea of what the controller is
like<00:03:30.479> and<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:31.229> a<00:03:31.259> good<00:03:31.439> one
