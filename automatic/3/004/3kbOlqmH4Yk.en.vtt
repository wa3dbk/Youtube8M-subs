00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
but I think at this point in my life

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
but I think at this point in my life
that<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:35.040> ends<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that they have it if my ends have it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.420 
that they have it if my ends have it
sealed<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.810> some<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> loves<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.159> then

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
sealed on some of the loves by now then
they're<00:01:38.579> probably<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.150> seal<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
they're probably not gonna seal and I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
they're probably not gonna seal and I
have<00:01:40.229> no<00:01:40.350> issue<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.310> plan

is<00:02:08.119> buildup<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.569> suffer<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.739> such

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
is buildup like I suffer from such

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.250 
is buildup like I suffer from such
a<00:02:11.709> huge<00:02:12.550> amount<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:13.000> product<00:02:13.630> buildup<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.110> my

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
a huge amount of product buildup in my

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
a huge amount of product buildup in my
in<00:02:14.410> my<00:02:14.440> locks<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.880> hard<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.420> get

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
in my locks and it's really hard to get

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.760 
in my locks and it's really hard to get
it<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:18.610> tend<00:02:19.150> not<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.360> use<00:02:19.510> heavy<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.709> a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
it out and I tend not to use heavy or a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.240 
it out and I tend not to use heavy or a
lot<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.280> products<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.819> my<00:02:22.120> hair<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.860> don't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
lot of products in my hair so I don't

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.000 
lot of products in my hair so I don't
know<00:02:24.370> why<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.440> much<00:02:26.560> lint

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
know why that is it's not so much lint

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.970 
know why that is it's not so much lint
as<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.490> just<00:02:27.900> product<00:02:28.900> build-up<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.560> it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
as it is just product build-up and it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.050 
as it is just product build-up and it's
really<00:02:30.190> hard<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> get<00:02:30.640> out

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
really hard to get out

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.690 
really hard to get out
so<00:02:31.420> yeah<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:32.020> suffering<00:02:32.440> from<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.069> lot<00:02:33.370> as

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
so yeah I'm suffering from that a lot as

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.320 
so yeah I'm suffering from that a lot as
of<00:02:34.090> late<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.550> yeah<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> guess<00:02:36.910> that's<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.300> I
