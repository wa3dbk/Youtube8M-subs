a<00:01:10.770> listen<00:01:10.979> real<00:01:11.280> quick<00:01:11.430> okay<00:01:11.759> I'll<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.270> back

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.880 

alright<00:01:21.359> so<00:01:21.539> basically<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.380> heard<00:01:22.590> there

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
alright so basically what we heard there

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.819 
alright so basically what we heard there
was<00:01:23.130> Samantha<00:01:23.969> talking<00:01:24.539> about<00:01:24.899> how<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
was Samantha talking about how the

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.399 
was Samantha talking about how the
robots<00:01:26.429> can<00:01:26.759> break<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> seal<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> believe<00:01:28.170> she

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
robots can break the seal I believe she

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.169 
robots can break the seal I believe she
said<00:01:28.649> I<00:01:28.679> might<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.100> wrong<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.640> anyways<00:01:30.000> it's

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
said I might be wrong but anyways it's

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.559 
said I might be wrong but anyways it's
how<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.420> robots<00:01:31.109> can<00:01:31.799> break<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
how the robots can break and get out of

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.669 
how the robots can break and get out of
this<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:35.780> situation<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.959> we<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
this like situation so we know that the

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.100 
this like situation so we know that the
next<00:01:37.979> step<00:01:38.039> has<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.399> do<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.909> robots<00:01:39.329> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
next step has to do with the robots but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.940 
next step has to do with the robots but
the<00:01:40.229> question<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.399> can<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.240> them

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the question is what can we do with them

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
the question is what can we do with them
we<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.789> know<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> but

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
we can go and then we know that but

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
we can go and then we know that but
we've<00:01:45.780> already<00:01:45.959> done<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.289> for<00:01:46.649> step<00:01:46.859> number

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
we've already done that for step number

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.480 
we've already done that for step number
two<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> use<00:01:48.719> them<00:01:48.990> somehow<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:50.280> maybe

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
two we need to use them somehow to maybe

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.910 
two we need to use them somehow to maybe
break<00:01:50.789> down<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.390> sort<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> barrier<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
break down some sort of barrier so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
break down some sort of barrier so
that's<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.939> next<00:01:54.179> step<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:55.349> step<00:01:55.619> three

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that's the next step that at step three

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.589 
that's the next step that at step three
is<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:56.849> someone<00:01:57.179> who's<00:01:57.270> gotten<00:01:57.569> this

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
is and maybe someone who's gotten this

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.969 
is and maybe someone who's gotten this
by<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.929> time<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.229> video<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.590> coming<00:01:58.860> up

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
by the time this video is coming up

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.729 
by the time this video is coming up
because<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.520> making<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.500> 12<00:02:01.500> hours

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
because I'm making this up 12 hours

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
live-streaming the easter egg but I'm

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.140 
live-streaming the easter egg but I'm
working<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.519> think<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.120> think

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
working on it and I think it I think

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
working on it and I think it I think
I've<00:02:27.420> got<00:02:27.450> some<00:02:28.019> sort<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.319> an<00:02:28.440> idea<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.069> go

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
I've got some sort of an idea what to go

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.960 
I've got some sort of an idea what to go
along<00:02:29.459> with<00:02:29.489> what<00:02:30.060> these<00:02:30.239> robots<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> do

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
along with what these robots have to do

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.979 
along with what these robots have to do
maybe<00:02:32.970> there<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.299> way<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.450> destroy<00:02:33.840> them

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
maybe there is a way to destroy them

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.449 
maybe there is a way to destroy them
because<00:02:34.139> when<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.350> shot<00:02:34.680> him<00:02:34.799> they<00:02:34.980> said<00:02:35.190> these

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
because when I shot him they said these

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.809 
because when I shot him they said these
robots<00:02:35.880> can't<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.269> destroyed<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
robots can't be destroyed with just a

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.150 
robots can't be destroyed with just a
small<00:02:39.269> arms<00:02:39.720> fire<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.380> what's<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:40.889> so<00:02:40.980> than

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
small arms fire so what's more so than

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.620 
small arms fire so what's more so than
small<00:02:41.549> arms<00:02:41.819> fire<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> question

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
small arms fire that's the question

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.660 
small arms fire that's the question
perhaps<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:43.590> combine<00:02:43.920> all<00:02:44.130> four<00:02:44.340> steps

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
perhaps if we combine all four steps

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.449 
perhaps if we combine all four steps
into<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.319> shot<00:02:46.319> one<00:02:46.739> shoot'em<00:02:47.130> shoot<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
into one shot one shoot'em shoot the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.490 
into one shot one shoot'em shoot the
robot<00:02:47.730> at<00:02:47.849> once<00:02:48.030> maybe<00:02:48.299> it'll<00:02:48.660> be<00:02:48.810> destroyed<00:02:49.019> I

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
robot at once maybe it'll be destroyed I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.259 
robot at once maybe it'll be destroyed I
don't<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.950> maybe<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:50.910> idea<00:02:51.030> but

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
don't know maybe that's just my idea but

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.970 
don't know maybe that's just my idea but
I'll<00:02:51.389> try<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.780> i'll<00:02:51.959> test<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> out<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thoughts are what step 3 could be we

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.770 
thoughts are what step 3 could be we
