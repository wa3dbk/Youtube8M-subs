00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 was established is to update it 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.950
 in that time that with you some ideas in the rucks 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 Much is said about how 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 but more than thinking only about achievements 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.140
 I presume that it is super important that everyone we brought 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.409
 We've participated 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.919
 little lasted the state 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.279
 and that therefore we have to have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 there is no clarity 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.950
 with love 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.800
 go up to generate value other words that we are doing to visit 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.750
 our sun 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.310
 let's remember what happens to us because we work joan puigcercÃ³s 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.150
 but the 50 a beginning 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.720
 according to few people 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.730
 that has a clean and cook list 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.050
 a good follow-up to the stick that this adds 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 to your clubs 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180
 in which the cutting recommendation 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.220
 Poplars and finalist in their blogs and pines nancy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.820
 it matters that they are five pages better even though this is going to serve us not 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.650
 Just for when we want to be a co-payment, we do not want to go to the boss 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 'for' 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.850
 dyn suggest we get a promotion with an improvement 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 a few more laps of career 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.490
 it is a clue that will serve us so that we are 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.580
 building 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 soda on the side 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.720
 to the maximum 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.390
 how do we make this list of achievements 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.090
 we said that god himself 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.170
 a euro are those things that go 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.110
 I want to deny 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.430
 that allow you to contribute with organization that this entity 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.250
 with physical presence 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 who visit this common sense 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.080
 agreement as an example 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.730
 it's like someone was not already in charge of selling the biscuits oil 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.450
 all the town 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.220
 then he will decide himself as he unfolds public gratitude understand 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.140
 responsible for the sale of arriving 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.549
 fantastic but we really want to know 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.090
 how many more laps 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.769
 skyscraper 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.239
 as long as Glendavis commented that he occupies the church 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.900
 in that cause in that sector thanks to your management the more sixty clients 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.169
 how much better or the mouse 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 since the skype mask has to do with removed 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.359
 look at the best way for your achievements ie a system that should not be 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.819
 emit your body 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 this map 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:34.929
 it's about thinking 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 the timely problem also this time the balance 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.849
 if you want state 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.739
 many people my grandfather with this does not do it because they have not come when I 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.589
 they said it 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.999
 that's a rousseff thing of 63 and extended metroflog 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.319
 now it is OK 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.939
 the hercules and the impact 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.929
 which has it been 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.259
 fair result concluded 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.919
 the dgt insiste assiste argentina insurance 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.580
 when it has to be public 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.380
 difficult to reassure with third parties as a goal does not have to do 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.369
 theology 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.369
 from the data of years ago the cut that these 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.650
 in just a few days the chaos is understandable the day we have the list 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.799
 of the results 7 most holy face 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.299
 the problem by 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 that we have clear that for that 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.019
 we fulfill ourselves, thus raising the solidity of the plan 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:36.739
 thanks to these practices
