00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.090
 this game was in gta but 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.279
 we were when in gta it's worth it because 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.200
 I had to stop it because I was mega 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.460
 burst all over the world and so good 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.900
 more than burst the world more also 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 is going to burst on me so I had to 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 leave the activity 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.350
 my mother we started well the race is 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.540
 I go on the other side me around here that 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.810
 If I go around here, it would be good for 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.810
 behind 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.380
 but please how water has passed 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.490
 here 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.300
 but what has happened and what has happened 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.450
 here 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 here we cut it by interior 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.380
 now it will remind me of the inside no 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.560
 It's worth a while that it's high 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.110
 the palm tree you know are such as they are 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.380
 they are the same they are identical a lamp post and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.700
 the palm tree are totally identical what 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.090
 only that you are that you do not have in common is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.979
 the palms and the like gives 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.560
 said that it is with a tank that is not 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.890
 breaks the streetlights and they break in gta 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.229
 the least in gta it does not matter if you come with 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.229
 a tank to all host with what 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.780
 a boeing 747 want no one what 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.970
 be that a tree will not break it in 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.599
 life never or never will you break 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.740
 a tree in gta in the damn life that 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:57.299
 is the only difference that remains 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.299
 here perfect epic 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.770
 the host 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.960
 that happens to me for talking 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 that happens to me because I did not care for a 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.110
 tree that I like the kid care 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.600
 that I eat the tree that has tried me 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.250
 overtaking inside but I'll 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.050
 closed the road worth akular something to the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.900
 king who comes equal right I think he the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.900
 which right is easy I think or you farc 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.710
 so that just happened there I just 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.450
 running over someone has been my thing 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.010
 I just ran over someone truth 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.010
 guys but here 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.440
 nothing that has been nothing 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:52.000
 nothing go go go go ramp 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.020
 go to the world 's best ramp 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.020
 another one that plays 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.900
 pale 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.310
 in fact it has already happened I would have 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.819
 past if it had not been because many 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.819
 cases with him 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.580
 is jumping to the point that it seems 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.940
 I think if nothing happens here we go 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.940
 seconds 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.050
 We are going to fight for second place 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.360
 I hope you did not give me a tap for 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.099
 please I ask you perfect the bad 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.150
 Perfect tap is playing clean 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.940

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.230
 mime 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.140
 I'm going to think that I'm playing dirty 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.480
 an entrance of purpose to me let's 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.790
 we need to overtake inside 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.470
 almost worth collecting the slipstream now 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.370
 we take the slipstream I went to the bar to see what 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.370
