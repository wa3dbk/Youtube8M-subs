it shows the kind of man he is but the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.090 
it shows the kind of man he is but the
amount<00:04:53.729> of<00:04:53.940> abuse<00:04:54.750> he's<00:04:55.110> taking<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.620> season

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
amount of abuse he's taking this season

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.430
