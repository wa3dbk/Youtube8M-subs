said Papa John's chicken tenders but

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.780 
said Papa John's chicken tenders but
these<00:00:12.710> are<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.920> only<00:00:13.040> things<00:00:13.280> I<00:00:13.370> saw<00:00:13.610> that

these are the only things I saw that

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.370 
these are the only things I saw that
that<00:00:14.059> was<00:00:14.120> kind<00:00:14.389> of<00:00:14.509> close<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:14.870> that<00:00:15.019> so<00:00:15.259> I'm

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
that was kind of close to that so I'm

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.320 
that was kind of close to that so I'm
assuming<00:00:15.679> they<00:00:15.889> say<00:00:16.040> Papa<00:00:16.400> Papa's<00:00:17.060> chicken

chickens kind of dry oh just so there's
a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.489> inconsistency<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:38.630> okay<00:02:39.630> well

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
a little inconsistency in it okay well

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.660 
a little inconsistency in it okay well
now<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.549> had<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> couple<00:02:41.880> bites<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.930> gives<00:02:43.170> us<00:02:43.319> a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
now I had a couple bites just gives us a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.930 
now I had a couple bites just gives us a
review<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.680> negatives<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.700> definitely

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
review the negatives is they definitely

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.800 
review the negatives is they definitely
needed<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.900> change<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.599> batter

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
needed to change up the the batter

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
needed to change up the the batter
recipe<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.319> little<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.709> didn't<00:02:53.640> need<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> put<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
recipe a little bit didn't need to put a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.610 
recipe a little bit didn't need to put a
little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.239> small<00:02:54.480> spaces<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.170> there<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.410> more

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
little bit small spaces in there is more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.550 
little bit small spaces in there is more
than<00:02:55.819> something<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.329> make<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.019> stand<00:02:58.349> out

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
than something just to make it stand out

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.120 
than something just to make it stand out
I<00:02:59.690> think<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.440> piece<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> chicken<00:03:01.920> was<00:03:02.100> a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
I think on one piece of chicken was a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.830 
I think on one piece of chicken was a
little<00:03:02.160> dry<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.489> another<00:03:03.060> piece<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.540> chicken

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
little dry the another piece the chicken

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000 
little dry the another piece the chicken
was<00:03:03.989> was<00:03:04.410> actually<00:03:04.680> pretty<00:03:04.799> good

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
was was actually pretty good

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.220 
was was actually pretty good
so<00:03:05.850> maybe<00:03:06.060> fix<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:06.569> consistency

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
so maybe fix that little consistency

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.400 
so maybe fix that little consistency
right<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.549> sizes<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.209> know<00:03:10.079> they<00:03:10.260> gave

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
right there the sizes I know they gave

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.289 
right there the sizes I know they gave
me<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> little<00:03:10.650> bit<00:03:10.769> more<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.639> you're<00:03:12.150> one

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
me a little bit more but if you're one

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.699 
me a little bit more but if you're one
of<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.450> unfortunate<00:03:12.720> people<00:03:12.959> get<00:03:13.200> these<00:03:13.410> as

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
of the unfortunate people get these as

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.370 
of the unfortunate people get these as
10<00:03:14.130> pieces<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.819> know<00:03:14.880> I'm<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.269> probably<00:03:15.870> kind

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
10 pieces you know I'm up probably kind

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.830 
10 pieces you know I'm up probably kind
of<00:03:16.410> math<00:03:17.030> part<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.150> gold<00:03:18.389> probably<00:03:18.750> be

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
of math part of the gold probably be

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.440 
of math part of the gold probably be
this<00:03:18.989> size<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.220> see<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.760> consistent

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
this size like to see more consistent

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.640 
this size like to see more consistent
uniform<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.650> these<00:03:23.660> okay<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> okay<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.319> that's

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
uniform of these okay and okay so that's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.720 
uniform of these okay and okay so that's
basically<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:27.690> things<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.049> would<00:03:28.200> change

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
basically the things that would change

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.890 
basically the things that would change
as<00:03:29.730> far<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.150> product

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
as far as this product

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.379 
as far as this product
maybe<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.980> wasn't<00:03:32.220> offered<00:03:32.700> different<00:03:33.090> types

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
maybe I wasn't offered different types

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.089 
maybe I wasn't offered different types
of<00:03:33.510> sauces<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:33.989> not<00:03:34.109> sure<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.349> probably<00:03:34.829> could

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
of sauces I'm not sure I probably could

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.680 
of sauces I'm not sure I probably could
ask<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.280> barbecue<00:03:35.670> sauce<00:03:35.849> but<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.420> I

outrageous<00:03:54.359> number<00:03:54.660> for<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.139> dollar<00:03:56.040> 49<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:56.970> I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
outrageous number for a dollar 49 so I

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.509 
outrageous number for a dollar 49 so I
could<00:03:57.959> just<00:03:58.139> stop<00:03:58.319> by<00:03:58.349> breaking<00:03:58.980> get<00:03:59.099> a<00:03:59.160> couple

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
unfortunately I don't think for that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.939 
unfortunately I don't think for that
price<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.449> think<00:04:03.479> this<00:04:04.049> is<00:04:04.229> more<00:04:04.380> well<00:04:04.739> priced
