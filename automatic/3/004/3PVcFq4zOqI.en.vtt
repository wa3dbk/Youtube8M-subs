different<00:01:26.659> whole<00:01:27.020> dolls<00:01:27.229> through<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.530> years

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
different whole dolls through the years

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.640 
different whole dolls through the years
six<00:01:28.790> years<00:01:28.970> ago<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.360> stumbled<00:01:29.659> across<00:01:29.900> a

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
six years ago I stumbled across a

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.520 
six years ago I stumbled across a
tracker<00:01:31.100> one<00:01:31.430> isn't<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.170> try<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.230> think<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
tracker one isn't it try to think of the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.080 
tracker one isn't it try to think of the
name<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.040> was<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.190> tracker<00:01:34.550> jackal
