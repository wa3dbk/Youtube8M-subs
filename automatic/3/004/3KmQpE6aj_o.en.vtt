00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
doesn't have the players personalized

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.430 
doesn't have the players personalized
means<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> position<00:00:48.300> number<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.289> as

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
means it has a position number and as

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
means it has a position number and as
there<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.309> their<00:00:50.489> position<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there because it has their position but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
there because it has their position but
it<00:00:51.600> doesn't<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.079> their<00:00:52.289> names<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.309> why

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it doesn't have their names and so why

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
it doesn't have their names and so why
does<00:00:54.000> having<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> first<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> last<00:00:54.930> real

names<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.800> every<00:00:55.860> player<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> game<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
names for every player make the game so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
names for every player make the game so
much<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.629> exciting<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.649> because
