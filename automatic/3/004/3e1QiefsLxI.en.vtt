00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.160
 water people it's always tisot of 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.820
 back for the presentation of this 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.550
 second map of dlc number 2 of call of 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.789
 duty kid I named devastation and the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.980
 map is called pm vote so you go 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.500
 see it's a pretty interesting pop 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.570
 at first you might think that 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.940
 it takes place on a big cargo ship so a 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.970
 ship but in fact it's not that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.500
 it's a bucket vatry list so I 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.480
 do not know if you know what 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.340
 it is I handed a little link in the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 description in fact it's machines 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.079
 which are used to dig on mines 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.899
 in the open and that's part of 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.460
 the biggest machines in the world you 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.890
 so see the little link I put 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.899
 in the description it's absolutely 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.810
 huge esteem so we understand better 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.640
 how then pump is in use 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.470
 maps simply because it's 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.850
 machines that are huge that make 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 several hundred meters 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 so there you see so I'm always 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.430
 in general melee with some friends 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.020
 I had put so anyway 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.570
 make up opponents bauer 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.130
 traders are farouk a kill and then 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.340
 also to be able to show you the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.799
 little who themselves from this map 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 so you see that this map is pretty 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.369
 open so when you're at the bottom 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 I want to say to the higher cons 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.250
 it's not a boat but it 's okay 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.540
 really makes one think of that so when 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.790
 you are at the upper deck that's true 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.299
 that you are pretty discovered so 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.840
 for some who aerial strict it's going 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.220
 to be devastating enough for the cam too 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.110
 but you'll see a little bit later 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.650
 how 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.270
 how is it unfolded otherwise 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.570
 here I found seven map 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.320
 pretty much really it changes a little 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 little dmap we had until the gold on 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.540
 ghost only small flat I would say this is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.030
 that actually there is this bridge 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.190
 lower so well there I am 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 currently is actually there is 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.600
 only so be this entry by the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.030
 middle so by an underground or otherwise 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.910
 give access by stairs on the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.570
 sides and I'm really scared that in match 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.230
 as a team 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.480
 bah will the guys who runs in the top 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.230
 makes you stop getting in you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 waiting in his fixed or leaning viewfinder 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.120
 squarely at the top of the stairs and there it 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.780
 could be quite annoying so that 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.910
 obviously to see how 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.680
 how are you going to play on this map but 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.020
 otherwise at first I really have 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 took a lot of fun playing in 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.910
 this map there is possibility I think of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.620
 make small leaps bypass 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 as you see there is still no 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.030
 wrong way it's still a small 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.850
 labyrinth a the brothel the real I 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.090
 am at the very end of this excavator at 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.650
 buckets at the very end of the machine and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.370
 you see that even though it's enough 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.330
 huge 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.130
 so here I had my first package so 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.350
 I was hoping it would be 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.880
 cayenne so I was praying 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.769
 I say to myself go go la cayolle 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 mccalebb which m so it takes to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.850
 the helicopter that releases my package and that is 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.920
 what happens to me at that moment once 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.269
 moreover I get killed in the back but 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.790
 good there for once I was not too 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.010
 mourning since it was a dog so there 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.280
 I cut obviously and I took a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.290
 little bit later where I got back 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.519
 so the controller and this time it 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.890
 had to do or just a little 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.290
 series of three he can see the call 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.760
 it so I had the package is there I 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.549
 you spoil a little bit obviously it's going 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.890
 this time be the klm and you go 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.260
 see this klm what is it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 true that for once it's enough 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.860
 different from the other cases we have and 20 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.040
 quite simply 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.410
 it's a chopper happiness so for the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.079
 little elders who played black ops 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.510
 first of the name it was called hewit and 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.360
 frankly that's exactly what you 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.450
 So I'll see you in 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.390
 in a turret heli with your 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.430
 prose minigun there and ben here you see 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.910
 small red squares of the enemies 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.340
 so I think that actually if the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.150
 players find themselves like this on the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.000
 upper bridge 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.610
 there is way to make a big fat big 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.780
 massacre with those yes for the shot 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.680
 to stop that it might be enough 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.800
 monstrous 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.250
 especially i think about ps4 and xbox one 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 if there is a way to play so we keep the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.730
 so stays nine to nine there is 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.030
 really mean to make a lot of kid 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.120
 in any case a fairly original map that 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.710
 I really expect to test in multi 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.320
 to see a little bit how it's going 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.919
 behave especially in relation to the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.590
 community 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.490
 and then I tell you next time 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.490
 for the third map 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 at
