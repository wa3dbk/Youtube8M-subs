00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.690
 good today we are with the putt of this 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.190
 honor 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.799
 and we are going to also 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.520
 It is a puzzle that has some hands 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.789
 of a watch comes here an institution 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.520
 in the vases you can buy for a 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.580
 side come the instructions in Chinese 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.789
 how absolutely nothing moves and by 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.759
 here are the instructions in English 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.500
 and good how it moves and such good was 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.230
 interesting maybe this I scan it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.230
 to have them before Chinese as in English 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.660
 the puzzle is this 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.130
 many people have specialized in this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.050
 and there are championships and all good 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.380
 and let's see and what this is about 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.870
 It is a puzzle that has two faces and 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.240
 there are nine watches here like 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.630
 sun hands indicates one we see here 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.470
 this mark that puts the 12 such then 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 I got this in this solution 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.980
 we have some wheels here for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980
 carry it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.950
 and depending on how the bolts are in these 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.950
 I'm here 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.130
 the corners 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.420
 ok and here on this side but then 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.680
 safe 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.410
 we look at this from here then you see 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.300
 are blocked by couples if you 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.960
 we give this from here this move 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.590
 independent here are only women 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.290
 and anyone who turns monte up here 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.750
 that they move all three at once and they 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.210
 move the rest 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.070
 the other way around , exactly the same thing happens 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.190
 what happens that these 4 move here 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.500
 ok with this one and with any of the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.250
 another three is the same let's say 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 it has the same 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.600
 and then this way it goes 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 imagining how it is below 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.650
 when one is below the other three are 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.370
 those that are below and this one is good 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.820
 then it tells us what the sub is 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.380
 center or the remaining subgroup 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.890
 blocked 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.630
 if we do it so then this 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.090
 up with here you see moving or 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 renting them tells us which one is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 tour 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.930
 and I'm here are these two does not have 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 greater mystery 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.120
 and let's mix this theme 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.290
 this is sometimes a bit complicated 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.540
 then they have pairs of pairs of 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.760
 movements once we have a 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.670
 configuration from top to bottom then 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.870
 we can move it by the one that is released 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.230
 that move all 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 6 2 3 123 because he's free 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.960
 ok it has no greater interior these two 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.430
 they move the same and they were for two more 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.910
 and it has no more mystery then we are going to 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.910
 we go 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.440
 once 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.060
 well the first objective is to do the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.950
 cross and then do the corners 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.110
 how do we make groups 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.250
 dragging we have all up 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.410
 we choose any of the two faces and 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.600
 it gives us exactly the same 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.820
 and the goal is always the same 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.300
 well we started we have these two for 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.110
 example 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.950
 what do we do then let's continue with 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:04.110
 these two and we're going to take it here 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.080
 is no longer we have it we can move 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.670
 these three west because this one we already have 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.400
 these three then now we block 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.640
 these three 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.250
 23 these two raised and this fallen and 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.660
 let's go to the next one that we have free 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.290
 here 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.730
 ok we block this east east to 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.780
 lift these two centers this fallen 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.710
 we go down also 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.129
 we are going to put it with this shoot you see already 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.589
 we have it 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.589
 we already have the cross 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.759
 all up all down according to the face 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.740
 that we are focused only on the 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.160
 cross we turn around let's do 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:54.300
 here also the cross and we are dragging 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:57.659
 we are going to see the east center, we are going to 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.970
 if we turn now one carefully beige and 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:05.220
 that does not move then these two for 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:08.780
 example and let's see let's put this 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.090
 with this one here we have it 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.820
 what we do this 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.540
 and so that these two go together 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.540
 this one above 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.319
 these two together with this one above and 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.430
 this is free as we have it here is 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.430
 he who sends us 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.910
 much 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:36.070
 we already have these three blocked 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:40.330
 these three have intersections and we're going to 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.419
 move with this from here that is fine 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:48.780
 and we already have it and we only look at 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:51.610
 the centers do not forgive there it's worth 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.199
 we block this this we remove it for 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.199
 than to do the last one here 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.430
 there we have it, we go through the above 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.710
 up the 12 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.510
 it's worth from behind and we followed this 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.080
 method does not follow everything the same 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.960
 OK 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.819
 simple we have any of the other 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.819
 we repeat them the same for the corners 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.280
 we are here in this for example 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.010
 what do we do we have everything rising up this 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.310
 we remove it all from the center they go to 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.820
 accompany this 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.910
 Okay, we have it, we are here and we are going 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.740
 to undo this 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.660
 all these 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.009
 and this now we have it well 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.009
 we go to this position 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:51.820
 we are raising this and we lower the 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.990
 next corner all at 12 the 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.810
 part of top you see already we have it 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.920
 we raise this and we lower this and all 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.190
 here at 1 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.590
 we already have all at twelve o'clock well 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.690
 on the other side and we have it 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.090
 I do not care to do it with a side that 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.490
 another one has to see how they move while being 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.210
 up and down then here we have the 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.980
 This town is not that we are complicated 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.980
 for people who like it very much 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.010
 because at the same time it does not have much 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:31.560
 much mixed good I hope you have 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.560
 liked and thanks for watching
