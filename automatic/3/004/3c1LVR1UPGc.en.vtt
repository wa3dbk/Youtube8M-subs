00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so you can see the layers now if you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.119 
so you can see the layers now if you
have<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.590> circle<00:00:35.750> cutter<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.829> skip

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
have a circle cutter and you can skip

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.740 
have a circle cutter and you can skip
this<00:00:38.340> step<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.910> said<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> didn't<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.420> one

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this step it just said I didn't have one

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
this step it just said I didn't have one
so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.410> gonna<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> shape<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.460> was

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so I was gonna have to shape it I was

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
so I was gonna have to shape it I was
just<00:00:41.640> getting<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> rough<00:00:42.750> edges

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
just getting the kind of the rough edges

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.400 
just getting the kind of the rough edges
off<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.329> I<00:00:45.329> didn't<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:45.960> well

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
off and I didn't do that very well

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.930 
off and I didn't do that very well
I<00:00:46.520> cut<00:00:47.520> wrong<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:51.770> that's<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.980> me<00:00:53.309> just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I cut wrong so that's just me just

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
I cut wrong so that's just me just
trying<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> cut<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
trying to cut them off and do that to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:07.880 
trying to cut them off and do that to
both<00:00:55.620> sides<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:58.469> order<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.449> clear<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:06.890> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
both sides in order to clear the and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.910 
both sides in order to clear the and
just<00:01:08.790> begin<00:01:09.119> shaping<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just begin shaping it again if you do it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.250 
just begin shaping it again if you do it
if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> already<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> circle<00:01:12.390> cutter<00:01:12.900> then

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
if you already have a circle cutter then

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740 
if you already have a circle cutter then
you<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> didn't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you don't have to do this but I didn't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.679 
you don't have to do this but I didn't
so<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> shaping<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.689> circle

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so I'm just shaping it into a circle

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.100 
so I'm just shaping it into a circle

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
cake with it and smooth out the edges

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
cake with it and smooth out the edges
and<00:01:53.329> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> galaxy<00:01:54.810> cake<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:56.130> kind

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and this is a galaxy cake so that's kind

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.149 
and this is a galaxy cake so that's kind
of<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.990> galaxy<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.469> rainbow<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
of a galaxy you were like rainbow I

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
of a galaxy you were like rainbow I
thought<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.479> looked<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.810> galaxy

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
thought it kind of looked like a galaxy

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.980 
thought it kind of looked like a galaxy
that<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.130> call<00:02:02.399> it

as nice as you can get it it's alright

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.400 
as nice as you can get it it's alright
if<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> bottom<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> little<00:02:30.930> rough

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
if the bottom is a little rough

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.360 
if the bottom is a little rough
then<00:02:31.770> begin<00:02:32.130> rolling<00:02:32.610> out<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.180> white<00:02:34.340> piece<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
then begin rolling out a white piece of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.150 
then begin rolling out a white piece of
clay<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.840> you're<00:02:37.380> gonna<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.709> two<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> those

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
clay and you're gonna make two of those

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.350 
clay and you're gonna make two of those
and<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.850> twist<00:02:39.060> seeing<00:02:39.239> them

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and then we get in twist seeing them

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.240 
and then we get in twist seeing them
together<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:46.290> wrap<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.920> around<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
together then wrap that around the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930 
together then wrap that around the
bottom<00:02:48.709> cut<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.280> smooth<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.790> edges

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
bottom cut it and then smooth the edges

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.770 
bottom cut it and then smooth the edges
together<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.860> use<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.370> ball<00:02:56.700> tool<00:02:56.940> or<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
together you can use a ball tool or the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.509 
together you can use a ball tool or the
other<00:02:57.989> end<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> ball<00:02:58.680> tool<00:02:58.980> doesn't

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
other end of the ball tool doesn't

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.070 
other end of the ball tool doesn't
really<00:02:59.730> matter<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.090> whatever<00:03:00.360> makes<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
really matter just whatever makes the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.289 
really matter just whatever makes the
crease<00:03:03.260> not<00:03:04.260> visible<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.670> you're<00:03:05.940> also<00:03:06.120> going

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
crease not visible and you're also going

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.610 
crease not visible and you're also going
to<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.450> repeating<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.819> top<00:03:09.290> as<00:03:10.290> well

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
to be repeating this to the top as well

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.590 
to be repeating this to the top as well
and<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.280> sure<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.519> pat<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.940> cake<00:03:12.299> to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
and make sure you pat down the cake to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.650 
and make sure you pat down the cake to
fill<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.560> space<00:03:13.950> between<00:03:14.450> icing<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
fill in the space between icing on the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.110 
fill in the space between icing on the
cake<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.170> repeat<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> top<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:17.910> just

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
cake so repeat this to the top and just

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.420 
cake so repeat this to the top and just
do<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> same<00:03:18.359> thing<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:22.890> smooth<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
do the same thing and then smooth it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.430 
do the same thing and then smooth it
again<00:03:24.590> um<00:03:25.910> try<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> make<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.390> two<00:03:27.600> scenes<00:03:28.019> of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
again um try to make the two scenes of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.670 
again um try to make the two scenes of
each<00:03:28.650> icing<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> same<00:03:30.239> spot<00:03:30.680> to

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
each icing on this in the same spot to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.930 
each icing on this in the same spot to
make<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.950> look<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.340> more<00:03:32.489> professional

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
make it look a little more professional

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.539 
make it look a little more professional
