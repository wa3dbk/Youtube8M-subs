00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
welcome back to Maya Mondays so a buddy

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.769 
welcome back to Maya Mondays so a buddy
of<00:00:05.040> mine<00:00:05.100> recently<00:00:05.850> sent<00:00:06.120> me<00:00:06.210> an<00:00:06.270> email<00:00:06.390> saying

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
of mine recently sent me an email saying

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.259 
of mine recently sent me an email saying
that<00:00:06.990> he's<00:00:07.080> discovered<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.620> bug<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.160> 2015<00:00:09.090> and

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
that he's discovered a bug in 2015 and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.160 
that he's discovered a bug in 2015 and
asked<00:00:09.450> if<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.599> knew<00:00:09.719> anything<00:00:09.870> about<00:00:09.990> it

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
asked if I knew anything about it

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.169 
asked if I knew anything about it
actually<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.590> didn't<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> looked<00:00:11.790> into<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.120> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
actually I didn't so I looked into it a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.270 
actually I didn't so I looked into it a
little<00:00:12.330> bit<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.799> I<00:00:13.799> came<00:00:14.040> up<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
little bit and I came up with a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
little bit and I came up with a
workaround<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.660> address<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> problem<00:00:16.199> so

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
workaround to to address a problem so

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.340 
workaround to to address a problem so
basically<00:00:17.340> there's<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.119> texture<00:00:18.900> caching

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
basically there's a texture caching

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.859 
basically there's a texture caching
issue<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.859> happening<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.420> IBL<00:00:21.810> node

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
issue that's happening with the IBL node

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
issue that's happening with the IBL node
in<00:00:22.320> 2015

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
in 2015

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.470 
in 2015
essentially<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:25.279> type<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.550> large<00:00:26.849> EXR

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
essentially if you type in a large EXR

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
essentially if you type in a large EXR
file<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.260> kind<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> standard<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.250> using

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
file the kind of standard way just using

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
file the kind of standard way just using
the<00:00:29.550> image<00:00:29.789> file<00:00:30.000> input<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.929> problem<00:00:31.320> comes

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the image file input the problem comes

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530 
the image file input the problem comes
into<00:00:31.769> play<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> fact<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.420> not

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
into play and the fact that it's not

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.880 
into play and the fact that it's not
getting<00:00:33.630> cached<00:00:34.050> properly<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:34.770> you're

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
getting cached properly when you're

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
getting cached properly when you're
working<00:00:35.190> interactively<00:00:35.670> inside<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> Maya<00:00:36.210> so

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
working interactively inside of Maya so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.000 
working interactively inside of Maya so
if<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:36.960> doing<00:00:37.170> things<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.410> IPR

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
if you're doing things like IPR

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.530 
if you're doing things like IPR
rendering<00:00:38.340> every<00:00:38.550> time<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> slider

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
rendering every time you make a slider

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.470 
rendering every time you make a slider
change<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.739> user<00:00:41.010> interface<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:42.000> has<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
change in the user interface it has to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
change in the user interface it has to
reload<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> file<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.800> keeping<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
reload that file and it's not keeping it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
reload that file and it's not keeping it
locally<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:44.730> cached<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.719> creates<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
locally or cached so that creates a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
locally or cached so that creates a
problem<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> takes<00:00:46.860> 10-15<00:00:47.250> seconds<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
problem if it takes 10-15 seconds to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
problem if it takes 10-15 seconds to
load<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> big<00:00:48.480> EXR<00:00:48.899> file<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.350> something

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
load in a big EXR file or something

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
load in a big EXR file or something
maybe<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> remote<00:00:50.340> drive<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
maybe off of a remote drive you know it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.000 
maybe off of a remote drive you know it
makes<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> every<00:00:52.649> time<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
makes it so that every time you make a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.209 
makes it so that every time you make a
slider<00:00:53.340> change<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> IPR<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.680> responsive

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
slider change in IPR it's not responsive

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
slider change in IPR it's not responsive
it<00:00:56.340> doesn't<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.640> work<00:00:56.940> well<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it doesn't really work well the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
it doesn't really work well the
interesting<00:00:58.440> thing<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.910> look<00:00:59.910> vic<00:01:00.090> discovered

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
interesting thing is look vic discovered

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
interesting thing is look vic discovered
that<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.949> file<00:01:02.879> texture<00:01:03.359> type

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that if you use the file texture type

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
that if you use the file texture type
node<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.350> instead<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.619> doing<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.000> using

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
node so instead of doing you know using

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
node so instead of doing you know using
the<00:01:06.420> file<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.830> image<00:01:07.950> name<00:01:08.250> if

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the file in right here an image name if

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
the file in right here an image name if
you<00:01:08.520> switch<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> texture<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.170> caching

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you switch it to texture it is caching

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
you switch it to texture it is caching
properly<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> problem<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.810> viewport

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
properly but the problem is the viewport

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
properly but the problem is the viewport
displays<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.890> incorrectly<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.610> 2015<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
displays it incorrectly in 2015 so you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999 
displays it incorrectly in 2015 so you
can<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.080> basically<00:01:16.619> flipped

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
can see that that's basically flipped

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.710 
can see that that's basically flipped
that<00:01:17.189> map<00:01:17.400> upside<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> obviously<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that map upside down and obviously the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
that map upside down and obviously the
color<00:01:18.930> correction<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> looks<00:01:19.770> looks<00:01:20.580> all

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
color correction on it looks looks all

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
color correction on it looks looks all
wonky<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.710> my<00:01:23.009> hack<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> get

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wonky so the way I got my hack to get

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.399 
wonky so the way I got my hack to get
around<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.570> figured<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.229> what

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
around this was I figured you know what

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
around this was I figured you know what
if<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.650> using<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.490> texture<00:01:26.970> node<00:01:27.180> why

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
if I'm using this this texture node why

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.590 
if I'm using this this texture node why
don't<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.020> text<00:01:28.350> your<00:01:28.470> map<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> sphere<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
don't I just text your map a sphere and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.510 
don't I just text your map a sphere and
have<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.810> sphere<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.799> display<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> my

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
have that sphere be my display in my

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010 
have that sphere be my display in my
viewport<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.180> exactly<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> did

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
viewport and that's exactly what I did

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
viewport and that's exactly what I did
so<00:01:34.200> parented<00:01:34.680> underneath<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.369> IBL<00:01:35.820> node<00:01:35.850> I've

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so parented underneath my IBL node I've

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
so parented underneath my IBL node I've
got<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> IBL<00:01:37.710> hack<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> simply<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
got this IBL hack which is just simply a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
got this IBL hack which is just simply a
sphere<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.500> jump<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> my<00:01:40.920> channel<00:01:41.310> box

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
sphere and if we jump to my channel box

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
sphere and if we jump to my channel box
and<00:01:42.329> turn<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> display<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> guy<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and turn on the display of that guy you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.249 
and turn on the display of that guy you
can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.579> sphere<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.869> texture

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
can see that that sphere has the texture

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
can see that that sphere has the texture
map<00:01:46.380> obviously<00:01:47.009> gamma<00:01:47.520> corrected<00:01:47.850> correctly

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
map obviously gamma corrected correctly

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
map obviously gamma corrected correctly
looking<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.170> viewport<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
looking good into my viewport and it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
looking good into my viewport and it's
gonna<00:01:50.850> line<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> IBL<00:01:52.320> node<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
gonna line up with what the IBL node is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
gonna line up with what the IBL node is
going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> render<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.450> one

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
going to use for the render now one

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
going to use for the render now one
thing<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> mention<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.649> sphere<00:01:56.189> I've

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
thing to mention is this sphere I've

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
thing to mention is this sphere I've
just<00:01:56.759> used<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> same<00:01:57.540> texture<00:01:57.990> map<00:01:58.229> right

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
just used that same texture map right

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
just used that same texture map right
that<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.770> shoved<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> IBL<00:02:00.299> node<00:02:00.329> going

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that was shoved in to the IBL node going

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
that was shoved in to the IBL node going
to<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> surface<00:02:01.829> shader<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to a surface shader and then at the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 
to a surface shader and then at the
shading<00:02:03.450> group<00:02:03.479> level<00:02:03.840> I've<00:02:04.170> told<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
shading group level I've told the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.859 
shading group level I've told the
surface<00:02:05.280> shader<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.969> export<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
surface shader not to export out the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
surface shader not to export out the
maya<00:02:07.079> shader<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:07.860> suppressing<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.640> maya

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
maya shader so by suppressing all maya

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.600 
maya shader so by suppressing all maya
shaders<00:02:09.379> basically<00:02:10.379> what<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.590> doing<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
shaders basically what I'm doing is this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.369 
shaders basically what I'm doing is this
this<00:02:11.910> doesn't<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.569> passed<00:02:12.780> over<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.140> mental

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
this doesn't get passed over to mental

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.790 
this doesn't get passed over to mental
ray<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> run

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
ray to run

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790 
ray to run
so<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.130> really<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.910> viewport<00:02:15.300> 2.0<00:02:15.840> so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so it's really just in viewport 2.0 so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.650 
so it's really just in viewport 2.0 so
with<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> simple<00:02:17.310> little<00:02:17.400> trick<00:02:17.640> I've<00:02:18.030> now

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
with the simple little trick I've now

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.870 
with the simple little trick I've now
got<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.200> seen<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:19.950> IPR<00:02:20.490> render<00:02:20.520> this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
got a seen that if we IPR render this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.440 
got a seen that if we IPR render this
guy<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:22.110> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.830> obviously<00:02:23.280> look<00:02:23.640> correct

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
guy it's going to obviously look correct

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.170 
guy it's going to obviously look correct
in<00:02:24.750> my<00:02:25.410> viewport<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.490> obviously<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
in my viewport and then obviously the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
in my viewport and then obviously the
the<00:02:27.720> background<00:02:28.080> image<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.710> be

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the background image is going to be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.480 
the background image is going to be
correct

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
correct

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.440 
correct
you<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> lineup<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> be

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you know the lineup is going to be

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.640 
you know the lineup is going to be
correct<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.960> have<00:02:31.080> infinite<00:02:31.470> turned

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
correct I think I have infinite turned

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.510 
correct I think I have infinite turned
on<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:31.950> why<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.190> looks<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.430> little

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
on that's why it looks a little

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.300 
on that's why it looks a little
different<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> viewport<00:02:34.380> versus<00:02:34.770> versus

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
different in the viewport versus versus

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.160 
different in the viewport versus versus
the<00:02:35.400> render<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.030> essentially<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:36.990> not

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the render here but essentially it's not

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.630 
the render here but essentially it's not
flipped<00:02:37.590> upside<00:02:37.920> down<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.520> know

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
flipped upside down and you know

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
flipped upside down and you know
everything<00:02:39.000> looks<00:02:39.240> looks<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:40.020> pretty

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
everything looks looks really pretty

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.220 
everything looks looks really pretty
pretty<00:02:40.590> good<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:41.700> obviously<00:02:42.330> because<00:02:43.110> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
pretty good and then obviously because I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.410 
pretty good and then obviously because I
IPR<00:02:43.680> rendered<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.190> guy<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.120> start<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
IPR rendered this guy and I start to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.750 
IPR rendered this guy and I start to
make<00:02:45.540> changes<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.050> my<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.740> my<00:02:46.860> texture<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.610> my

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
make changes to my to my texture to my

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.450 
make changes to my to my texture to my
you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.600> my<00:02:48.960> scene<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.460> everything

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
you know my scene here everything

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.070 
you know my scene here everything
updates<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:50.940> real<00:02:51.090> time<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.690> trying<00:02:51.990> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
updates in real time it's not trying to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
updates in real time it's not trying to
cash<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.650> some<00:02:53.310> file<00:02:53.580> that's<00:02:53.850> taking<00:02:54.090> 10<00:02:54.240> 15

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
cash in some file that's taking 10 15

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.120 
cash in some file that's taking 10 15
seconds<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> cash<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.830> simple

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
seconds to cash in so it's a simple

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.670 
seconds to cash in so it's a simple
little<00:02:56.190> trick<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.630> does<00:02:58.050> sort<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.440> work

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
little trick but it does sort of work

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.370 
little trick but it does sort of work
around<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.460> bug<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.570> was<00:03:00.690> introduced<00:03:01.140> in

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
around the bug that was introduced in

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.710 
around the bug that was introduced in
2015<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.280> hopefully<00:03:02.610> if<00:03:03.120> anybody<00:03:03.570> has<00:03:03.690> been

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
2015 so hopefully if anybody has been

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.750 
2015 so hopefully if anybody has been
running<00:03:04.080> into<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:05.070> workflow<00:03:05.490> issue

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
running into this this workflow issue

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.880 
running into this this workflow issue
this<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.960> hack<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.380> we'll<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.740> you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
this this hack will we'll get you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.270 
this this hack will we'll get you
through<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
through it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.210 
through it
and<00:03:08.450> I've<00:03:09.450> sent<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> file<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.230> QA<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.740> I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and I've sent the file up to QA so I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.620
