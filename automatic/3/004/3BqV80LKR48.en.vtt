00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.240
 channel tells the story of lives 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.179
 of the children of disney villains 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.760
 the Colombian crisis sofía carson spoke 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 with news breaker in Spanish about the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 character that she played 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.870
 and the daughter is the evil queen of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.460
 Snow White and being the daughter of her 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.560
 mother and grew up thinking that what the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.989
 define as a person and its reflection in the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 been what matters in life is to be 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.900
 Be beautiful and love a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 Prince Charming who gives you his final tennis 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.390
 but and the account says that soma was 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.700
 very wrong that the prince thinking 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.060
 men is not 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.120
 very nice and realizes that what 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.110
 matter in life is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.969
 It's pretty on the inside that she is herself and 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.010
 that and that what matters is not what the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.170
 our old ones define the mirror that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.759
 it was the most fun to sign these 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.670
 doubts had so many moments 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.640
 unforgettable I think for me being 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.159
 singer and if there is no flour also the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.580
 most special moments for me were 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.070
 uncles ians names were the beginning 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 of the film guarente de corey and the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 final knowing I remember 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 perfectly the moment that I rode in 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.550
 a stage when we were recording 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.740
 Steelers and dance all night 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.700
 I entered my whole heart and I enjoyed it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 very much was a dream in this story 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
 villains 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 suddenly they are not as bad as we think 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 so I think there's a story 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 behind the villains one reason why 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 that for paul because they are villains and I 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.189
 I think we're going to learn it in this in 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 this movie and we also learn that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.200
 suddenly they are able to choose to be 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.400
