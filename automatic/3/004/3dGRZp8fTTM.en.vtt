something that's always kind of puzzled
me<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:49.320> people<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> buy<00:01:51.060> or

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
me how people can go out and buy or

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.950 
me how people can go out and buy or
capture<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:52.619> exotic<00:01:53.100> pets<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.540> seem

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
capture these exotic pets and then seem

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
capture these exotic pets and then seem

behave in a domesticated manner because
I<00:02:00.119> guess<00:02:00.270> maybe<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.570> don't<00:02:00.689> realize<00:02:01.140> that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
is a win-win situation for them but and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.800 
is a win-win situation for them but and
then<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:13.850> wouldn't<00:03:14.390> looking<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
then so I wouldn't looking on the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.810 
then so I wouldn't looking on the
internet<00:03:15.350> because<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:16.070> was<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.370> well<00:03:16.550> exactly

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
internet because I was like well exactly

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.970 
internet because I was like well exactly
i<00:03:17.060> wonder<00:03:17.480> how<00:03:17.630> common<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.620> because<00:03:18.950> you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
i wonder how common this is because you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.740 
i wonder how common this is because you
hear<00:03:19.250> about<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.610> on<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.820> internet<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
hear about it on the internet on the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.340 
hear about it on the internet on the
news<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> lot<00:03:21.550> but<00:03:22.550> then<00:03:22.880> again<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.480> lot<00:03:24.050> i<00:03:24.080> guess

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
news a lot but then again a lot i guess

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.690 
news a lot but then again a lot i guess
is<00:03:24.530> kind<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.860> wrong<00:03:25.040> term<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.580> really

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
is kind of a wrong term is you really

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.490 
is kind of a wrong term is you really
don't<00:03:25.880> hear<00:03:26.030> about<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.360> very<00:03:26.480> often<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.290> i

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
