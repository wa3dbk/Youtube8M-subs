to<00:01:44.189> me<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.939> imagined<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.930> come

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to me I just imagined that that come

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200 
to me I just imagined that that come
around<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> curve<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.009> automatically<00:01:47.579> slows<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
around a curve it automatically slows to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
around a curve it automatically slows to
fifty<00:01:48.840> miles<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.110> should<00:01:49.320> look<00:01:49.439> into<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
fifty miles they should look into that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.370 
fifty miles they should look into that
yeah<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.939> there's<00:01:51.420> apparently<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.020> sort

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
yeah and so there's apparently some sort

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
yeah and so there's apparently some sort
of<00:01:52.409> alarm<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.799> goes<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.420> driver<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of alarm that goes off if the driver is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649 
of alarm that goes off if the driver is
going<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:56.100> too<00:01:56.159> fast<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.240> case<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
going way too fast and in this case the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389 
going way too fast and in this case the
alarm<00:01:57.869> did<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.200> off<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.710> too<00:01:58.950> late<00:01:59.159> he

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
alarm did go off but it was too late he

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.149 
alarm did go off but it was too late he
said<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> fucked<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.869> want<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> die<00:02:01.680> yeah

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
said I fucked it up I want to die yeah

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.179 
said I fucked it up I want to die yeah
and<00:02:02.640> he<00:02:03.210> came<00:02:03.360> away<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.780> minor<00:02:04.020> injuries<00:02:04.439> now

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
recover in time you know then I would

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.750 
recover in time you know then I would
think<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.680> at<00:03:18.889> some<00:03:19.069> point<00:03:19.099> would<00:03:19.519> be<00:03:19.549> like

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
think you at some point would be like

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.159 
think you at some point would be like
okay<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.090> was<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> terrible<00:03:20.659> mistake<00:03:20.720> at<00:03:21.079> the

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
okay it was a terrible mistake at the

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.229 
okay it was a terrible mistake at the
worst<00:03:21.379> possible<00:03:21.829> time<00:03:22.099> but<00:03:22.849> it<00:03:22.940> wasn't

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
worst possible time but it wasn't

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.479 
worst possible time but it wasn't
deliberate<00:03:23.629> carelessness<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.949> is

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
deliberate carelessness it was this is

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.969 
deliberate carelessness it was this is
deliberate<00:03:26.180> she<00:03:26.510> was<00:03:26.750> like<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.959> Latina<00:03:27.650> based

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
deliberate she was like a Latina based

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.170 
deliberate she was like a Latina based
on<00:03:28.129> his<00:03:28.250> history<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.639> fact<00:03:28.819> that<00:03:28.939> he<00:03:29.000> posted

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
on his history the fact that he posted

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.809 
on his history the fact that he posted
the<00:03:29.449> picture<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> year<00:03:30.379> but<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:30.949> also<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.340> mean

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
the picture a year but but also it mean

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.099 
the picture a year but but also it mean
we<00:03:31.939> mentioned<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.329> couple<00:03:32.419> times<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.959> he's<00:03:33.079> a

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
we mentioned a couple times that he's a

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.110 
we mentioned a couple times that he's a
better<00:03:33.349> 30<00:03:34.040> years<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.519> may<00:03:34.669> actually<00:03:34.849> have

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
better 30 years that may actually have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.460 
better 30 years that may actually have
worked<00:03:35.329> against<00:03:35.659> it<00:03:35.780> because<00:03:36.079> someone<00:03:36.290> who's

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
worked against it because someone who's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.050 
worked against it because someone who's
brand-new<00:03:36.919> might<00:03:37.189> be<00:03:37.340> incredibly<00:03:37.699> scared

brand-new might be incredibly scared
about<00:03:38.180> causing<00:03:38.599> some<00:03:38.780> kind<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.989> accident

about causing some kind of accident
whereas<00:03:39.620> he's<00:03:39.829> done

up the ante a little bit perhaps
their<00:03:48.259> minds<00:03:48.709> are<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:48.979> guys<00:03:49.129> who<00:03:49.310> keep<00:03:49.459> the

their minds are the guys who keep the

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.550 
their minds are the guys who keep the
tire<00:03:49.819> in<00:03:50.030> their<00:03:50.180> back<00:03:50.329> yard<00:03:50.689> and<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.900> go<00:03:51.079> that

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
tire in their back yard and they go that

tired never in a baby before yeah yeah
but<00:03:54.650> he's<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.859> tiger<00:03:55.189> and<00:03:55.639> if<00:03:55.729> you<00:03:55.849> take<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.090> train

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
but he's a tiger and if you take a train

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.119 
but he's a tiger and if you take a train
at<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.900> certain<00:03:57.229> speed<00:03:57.500> around<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.829> curve

at a certain speed around a curve
there's<00:03:58.639> something<00:03:59.030> called<00:03:59.180> physics<00:03:59.689> and<00:03:59.989> it

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
there's something called physics and it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.009 
there's something called physics and it
