00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.439
 Hello, you are welcome 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.780
 when a recipe comes today this 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.670
 a pie from me has my son 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.130
 birthday and he has become one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.379
 I wanted strawberry cake then 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 still through the studies makes like me the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 make do I have now only times 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.369
 One reason I always ask you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.010
 show five eggs I burned 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 egg whites of egg yolk and protein I have 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.930
 200 grams of sugar 1 packet 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.379
 Vanilla sugar added in egg white 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.470
 a pinch of salt 2 tablespoons of water 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.140
 I then forced here has gram flour 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.660
 a packet of baking powder now ready 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.610
 first yolk and egg white separately 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 want to beat in the meantime 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.460
 of course, the flour with the baking powder 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.460
 it is simply mixed over it 7 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 so i have my jump from the jetset and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.189
 evaluates these I'm starting 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.200
 it was me five six eggs 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 so saved at 180 degrees about 45 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 minute to deco and that is what I have 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.619
 those of bullfighting I 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 seen by chance 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.010
 it is posted everywhere 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 I just took paper now 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.770
 and then have my template on it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520
 given 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 i have chocolate here or 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 strawberry flavor these are anyway 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.299
 already so and cut but the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.210
 politics to fat and they will 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.850
 then just a little bit hold me 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 By the way, I burnt myself then 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 I would cook so much and bake now 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.430
 then here is white chocolate 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.299
 Melt brought and white chocolate 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.299
 geilich the 1 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:02:00.490
 we have to be careful about that 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.490
 The city ​​does not slip away 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.280
 so now I have filled all the gaps 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.730
 and now I will complete it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.510
 Allow to cool so the chocolate is 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.680
 now become firm 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.800
 I just have a bit 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.360
 lift up and suppress the pattern 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 if you notice that goes a bit 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.440
 hard then you can with a knife 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:45.620
 just keep playing there and then 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.620
 out so slow can you raise the Sun. 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.840
 then he can see everything 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 what comes out just removes that so 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 the minster remains so much for the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.750
 dark chocolate is already 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.900
 molten 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.600
 This is very fast here and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.650
 who it on simply distribute it and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 Of course also fit that also at the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 stay put and do not slip with 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.790
 which is nicely smoothed out 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 leave that for now 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.209
 completely cooled so for the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.580
 I have three friends here 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.129
 and about 500 grams of strawberry will be 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.610
 namely an app of the pan pie with 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:51.180
 chocolate and then I have it off then 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:54.870
 hard it's suddenly pure vegetable 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.530
 so that the cream remains the beauty shop 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.220
 would have been so now that is 23 minutes 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.380
 on the apparatus pure food for one pack 1 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.930
 tablespoon of ours namely three tablespoons 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.049
 and will then form the pans's 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.709
 a bit aside for the sides 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.919
 so I lie the sides of my cake 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:25.169
 can brush with it and then give 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.600
 the strawberries here so the chocolate 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.229
 is now completely cool one 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.150
 cake is also out of the oven 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:37.260
 Now I'll just make the chocolate 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:43.020
 so cut out as big as my jumps 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.720
 of cash I jam with a 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.660
 diluted a little bit of water and then will 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.780
 Just give it over the cake is like that 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.690
 went up high that I because the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.010
 dans have divided into three parts and 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.539
 Now give his over it and we 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.539
 then the answer to that 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.479
 last floor 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.610
 of course you can also I have 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:28.499
 At home I have all faire cherry 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:33.449
 mood then the pages my 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:36.990
 did come with chocolate grated South Korea 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.539
 then so slowly now to conclusion so 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.059
 Now my steps are the data I 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.809
 yes decorated already cold 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.020
 become 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:48.659
 I'll just turn it over my head 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.669
 pie makes paper easy 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:55.289
 then removed some strawberries 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.839
 set aside switch on cut 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.319
 then I just have them in white 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:03.749
 chocolate baptized in and over 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.360
 then just give dark chocolate 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:09.599
 and will now be the pages 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.309
 Decorate a bit so finished is mine 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.749
 cake 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.749
 That's how the cake looks 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:23.460
 I have a tip for you then 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.580
 so that the cake then shines nicely 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.080
 of course I have a little bit on it 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:34.960
 given but very little and then with 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.620
 kitchen paper simply smoothed 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.310
 so that it shines a bit, therefore 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.220
 not so much of dante food but that 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.680
 Of course, I'll look great 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.250
 of course, also beautifully decorated 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.130
 to have 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.289
 then I have my love for 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.990
 discovered chocolate and has found 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.330
 that chocolate is so great 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.510
 I can decorate you then in the 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.910
 run several times the savior of the time 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.760
 show how you then your data with 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.000
 so you can decorate the chocolate 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.520
 pie tastes really delicious what you are 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.370
 Of course, he must be careful that he 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.620
 chocolate is not too thick on top 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.479
 otherwise you can not delete it 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.470
 cut this as best we can 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.539
 his 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.070
 Of course, the film is for everyone 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.229
 leave 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.229
 I 've just got the cake with me 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:31.060
 cream strawberry filled because you can do it that way 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:34.660
 that's what it's like for me 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.690
 I am rather fischmann filling 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.780
 I hope you save it while watching 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:44.250
 and winter have fun trying it out 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.250
