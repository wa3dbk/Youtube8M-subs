can do a little bit more with the pro
and<00:00:52.379> Plus<00:00:52.649> plan<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> pay

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and Plus plan but then you have to pay

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
and Plus plan but then you have to pay
money<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> do

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
money for that and you don't want to do

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.760 
money for that and you don't want to do
that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889 
that
it<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.309> gives<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.969> gigabyte<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.719> space

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it also gives you one gigabyte of space

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
it also gives you one gigabyte of space
for<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.829> media<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.609> videos<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
for for media like like videos and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689

photos of your family documents for

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
photos of your family documents for
example<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.409> nice

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
example so that's that's pretty nice

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.230 
example so that's that's pretty nice
actually<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> can't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.519> imagine<00:01:05.760> needing

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
actually I can't really imagine needing

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
actually I can't really imagine needing
more<00:01:06.450> fit<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.960> than<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.260> personally<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
more fit more than that personally so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
more fit more than that personally so
this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> geni<00:01:08.970> tree<00:01:09.299> looks<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this is what a geni tree looks like it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
this is what a geni tree looks like it
starts<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> bottom<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.909> me<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
starts here at the bottom with me and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
starts here at the bottom with me and
then<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.659> parents<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> scroll

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then my parents and then you can scroll

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
then my parents and then you can scroll
through<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.610> example<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:15.240> dad's<00:01:15.479> entire

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
through for example my dad's entire

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.130 
through for example my dad's entire
extended<00:01:16.470> family<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.090> pretty<00:01:18.479> extensive

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
extended family so it's pretty extensive

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
extended family so it's pretty extensive
my<00:01:19.530> mom<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> aunt<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.700> been<00:01:20.790> working

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
my mom and aunt and I have been working

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.590 
my mom and aunt and I have been working
on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.600> whole<00:01:21.780> tree<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:23.040> years<00:01:23.369> now

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
on the whole tree for for many years now

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.450 
on the whole tree for for many years now
so<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.259> gotten<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:25.920> big<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so it's it's gotten pretty big and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
so it's it's gotten pretty big and
that's<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> collaboration

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that's what I like the collaboration

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
that's what I like the collaboration
really<00:01:28.049> helps<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> lot<00:01:28.860> faster<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.700> lazy

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
really helps it go a lot faster I'm lazy

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
really helps it go a lot faster I'm lazy
so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> haven't<00:01:30.570> added<00:01:30.869> any<00:01:30.990> photos<00:01:31.470> except<00:01:31.829> my

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so I haven't added any photos except my

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
so I haven't added any photos except my
own<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> tree<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> dig

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
own but you can see the tree and dig

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
own but you can see the tree and dig

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
and to see how it would handle we tried

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.540 
and to see how it would handle we tried
some<00:06:00.260> of<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.410> latest<00:06:00.770> steam<00:06:01.010> games<00:06:01.250> but<00:06:01.490> at

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
some of the latest steam games but at

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.580 
some of the latest steam games but at
the<00:06:01.640> office<00:06:01.880> here<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.150> mostly<00:06:02.479> play<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:02.840> lot<00:06:03.380> of

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
the office here we mostly play a lot of

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.380 
the office here we mostly play a lot of
left4dead<00:06:04.100> a<00:06:04.430> little<00:06:04.610> bit<00:06:04.700> an<00:06:04.820> older<00:06:05.060> game<00:06:05.210> but

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
left4dead a little bit an older game but

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.030 
left4dead a little bit an older game but
we<00:06:05.479> busted<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.110> thing<00:06:06.290> up<00:06:06.440> to<00:06:06.560> almost<00:06:06.680> max

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
we busted that thing up to almost max

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.920 
we busted that thing up to almost max
settings<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.669> handled<00:06:08.030> it<00:06:08.150> like<00:06:08.360> a

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
settings and it handled it like a

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.870 
settings and it handled it like a
rockstar<00:06:09.560> so<00:06:10.070> any<00:06:10.190> game<00:06:10.460> you<00:06:10.490> could<00:06:10.760> download

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
rockstar so any game you could download

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.240 
rockstar so any game you could download
this<00:06:11.479> you'll<00:06:11.720> be<00:06:11.840> able<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.350> handle<00:06:12.740> pretty

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
this you'll be able to handle pretty

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.610 
this you'll be able to handle pretty
well<00:06:13.520> actually<00:06:13.700> and<00:06:14.080> unplug<00:06:15.080> it<00:06:15.229> take<00:06:15.350> it<00:06:15.560> out
