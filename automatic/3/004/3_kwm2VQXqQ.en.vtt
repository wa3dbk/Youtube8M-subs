 You [G] lived the nights [B7] with the moonlight [Em] golden 

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:36.802
 You have [C] lived those nights outside [Am] the other, sandy beach [B7] sand

 [C] I wish you were [G] talking 

00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:53.584
 Together [Am] listening to the waves of rapids [C] rock, thousands of singing songs [D] average 

00:01:53.584 --> 00:02:01.257
 You [G] know that loneliness is [B7], every time [I] is away from you 

00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:08.493
 Each group of [C] birds at the end of the horizon [Am] is caught, looking for a place of peace [B7]

00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:24.315
 And the warm [Am] has been on [C] for days, always close to [D] next to me 

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:30.135
 [C] I'm away from you [G] for many days 

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:33.513
