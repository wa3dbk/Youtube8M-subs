the first round well yeah the first run

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.980 
the first round well yeah the first run
wasn't<00:05:45.400> nearly<00:05:45.669> as<00:05:45.789> tough<00:05:46.030> as<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.330> finals<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
wasn't nearly as tough as the finals the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.930 
wasn't nearly as tough as the finals the
finals<00:05:47.380> are<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:47.710> close<00:05:48.039> you<00:05:48.669> know<00:05:48.760> the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
finals are so close you know the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.520 
finals are so close you know the
difference<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:49.419> for<00:05:49.599> the<00:05:49.659> Cubbies<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.349> know

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
difference like for the Cubbies you know

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.529 
difference like for the Cubbies you know
it<00:05:50.800> was<00:05:50.889> painful<00:05:51.340> losing<00:05:51.729> being<00:05:52.060> swept<00:05:52.389> this

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
it was painful losing being swept this

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.450 
it was painful losing being swept this
week<00:05:52.780> that's<00:05:53.349> never<00:05:53.590> good<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:54.099> that<00:05:54.250> never

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
week that's never good and that never

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.920 
week that's never good and that never
feels<00:05:54.729> good<00:05:55.060> but<00:05:55.210> if<00:05:55.419> you<00:05:55.570> know<00:05:55.690> if<00:05:55.750> he<00:05:55.840> had

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
feels good but if you know if he had

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.300 
feels good but if you know if he had
done<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.320> World<00:05:56.500> Series<00:05:56.590> it's<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.130> lot

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
done to the World Series it's a lot

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.399 
done to the World Series it's a lot
worse<00:05:57.520> because<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:58.419> got<00:05:58.570> so<00:05:58.750> close<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.289> you

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
worse because you got so close and you

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.200 
worse because you got so close and you
were<00:05:59.500> right<00:05:59.680> there<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.070> for<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.280> Mavs<00:06:00.520> we're

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
were right there and for the Mavs we're

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.750 
were right there and for the Mavs we're
up<00:06:01.449> to<00:06:01.479> 0<00:06:01.720> we<00:06:02.199> had<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.349> chance<00:06:02.650> really<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:03.010> to

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
up to 0 we had a chance really to to

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.580 
up to 0 we had a chance really to to
just<00:06:03.789> go<00:06:04.150> to<00:06:04.210> Miami<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:04.840> win<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.020> couple<00:06:05.289> games

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
just go to Miami and win a couple games

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.230 
just go to Miami and win a couple games
and<00:06:05.919> finish<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.159> out<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.610> we<00:06:06.669> didn't<00:06:06.940> do<00:06:07.060> it

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
and finish it out and we didn't do it

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.210 
and finish it out and we didn't do it
and<00:06:07.360> and<00:06:07.570> that<00:06:07.990> really<00:06:08.260> hurt<00:06:08.500> but<00:06:08.830> getting

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
and and that really hurt but getting

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.710 
and and that really hurt but getting
swept<00:06:09.490> last<00:06:09.580> year<00:06:10.000> or<00:06:10.180> getting<00:06:10.389> beat<00:06:10.539> last

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
swept last year or getting beat last

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.020 
swept last year or getting beat last
year<00:06:11.190> against<00:06:12.190> Golden<00:06:12.430> State<00:06:12.460> was<00:06:12.760> certainly

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
year against Golden State was certainly

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.210 
year against Golden State was certainly
not<00:06:13.240> fun<00:06:13.570> but<00:06:13.870> wasn't<00:06:14.590> nearly<00:06:14.740> as<00:06:14.860> bad<00:06:15.130> as

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
not fun but wasn't nearly as bad as

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.700 
not fun but wasn't nearly as bad as
losing<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.699> finals<00:06:16.090> but<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.510> know<00:06:16.870> he's<00:06:17.470> the

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
losing the finals but you know he's the

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.200 
losing the finals but you know he's the
one<00:06:17.889> thing<00:06:18.070> about<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:18.400> mavs<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.849> one<00:06:19.060> thing

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
one thing about the mavs and one thing

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.760 
one thing about the mavs and one thing
I've<00:06:19.300> learned<00:06:19.330> in<00:06:19.810> almost<00:06:20.139> eight<00:06:20.349> years<00:06:20.560> of

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
I've learned in almost eight years of

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.129 
I've learned in almost eight years of
owning<00:06:20.919> the<00:06:21.099> team<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.610> that<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.630> key<00:06:22.870> thing<00:06:23.110> is

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
owning the team is that the key thing is

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.810 
owning the team is that the key thing is
what's<00:06:23.620> your<00:06:23.770> leadership<00:06:24.039> like<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.669> what's

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
what's your leadership like and what's

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.189 
what's your leadership like and what's
the<00:06:24.970> chemistry<00:06:25.419> in<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.539> locker<00:06:25.750> room<00:06:25.900> like

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
the chemistry in the locker room like

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.040 
the chemistry in the locker room like
and<00:06:26.500> if<00:06:26.800> you've<00:06:26.949> got<00:06:27.159> good<00:06:27.520> strong<00:06:28.449> people<00:06:28.870> and

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
and if you've got good strong people and

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.480 
and if you've got good strong people and
you've<00:06:29.169> got<00:06:29.289> a<00:06:29.349> good<00:06:29.590> strong<00:06:29.860> locker<00:06:30.159> room

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
you've got a good strong locker room

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.250 
you've got a good strong locker room

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
then you can bounce back for those

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.019 
then you can bounce back for those
things<00:06:32.529> and<00:06:32.710> I'm<00:06:32.830> i<00:06:33.159> know<00:06:33.279> i<00:06:33.460> know<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.820> Mavs

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
that it hasn't worked out what would be

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.490

your<00:06:48.639> philosophy<00:06:49.330> of<00:06:49.419> running<00:06:49.720> a<00:06:49.840> team<00:06:50.320> like

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
your philosophy of running a team like

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.050 
your philosophy of running a team like
the<00:06:50.680> Cubs<00:06:50.919> because<00:06:51.100> you're<00:06:51.310> seeing<00:06:51.580> Arizona

the Cubs because you're seeing Arizona
Colorado<00:06:52.410> teams<00:06:53.410> basically<00:06:53.949> they've<00:06:54.100> done<00:06:54.280> it

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
Colorado teams basically they've done it

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.670 
Colorado teams basically they've done it
from<00:06:54.550> from<00:06:54.970> the<00:06:55.180> grassroots<00:06:55.449> from<00:06:56.380> their<00:06:56.500> own

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
from from the grassroots from their own

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.700 
from from the grassroots from their own
organization<00:06:57.430> building<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.270> team<00:06:58.540> uh<00:06:59.050> it

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
organization building the team uh it

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.740 
organization building the team uh it
would<00:06:59.979> it<00:07:00.130> be<00:07:00.250> that<00:07:00.280> way<00:07:00.639> or<00:07:00.699> would<00:07:00.940> you<00:07:01.120> still

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
would it be that way or would you still

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.390
