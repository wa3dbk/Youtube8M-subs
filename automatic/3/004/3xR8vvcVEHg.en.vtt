their imagination their emotional
associations<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.380> everything<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.219> it's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
associations with everything so it's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240 
associations with everything so it's
their<00:00:33.180> book<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.750> think<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.110> hard<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:35.070> really

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
their book I think it's hard to really

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.000 
their book I think it's hard to really
honor<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.850> book<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> put<00:00:36.840> everything<00:00:37.260> that's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
honor a book and put everything that's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.520 
honor a book and put everything that's
in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> book<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> movie<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.320> think

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
in the book into the movie but I think

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.319 
in the book into the movie but I think
that's<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> challenge<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> beauty

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that's also the challenge and the beauty

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.660 
that's also the challenge and the beauty
of<00:00:42.540> adapting<00:00:43.230> our<00:00:43.379> book<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> movie<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.430> the
