classes what's going to happen is your

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.109 
classes what's going to happen is your
primary<00:00:15.500> set<00:00:15.949> is<00:00:16.070> going<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.400> take<00:00:16.640> president

primary set is going to take president

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.240 
primary set is going to take president
over<00:00:17.300> everything<00:00:17.690> else<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:18.920> dealing

over everything else so in dealing

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.349 
over everything else so in dealing
damage<00:00:19.369> you're<00:00:19.699> going<00:00:19.850> to<00:00:19.910> want<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:20.119> stack

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.220 
intelligence pretty straightforward
right<00:00:26.210> these<00:00:26.960> stats<00:00:27.169> right<00:00:27.380> here<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:29.230> from

right these stats right here and from

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.260 
right these stats right here and from
there<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:31.189> want<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.490> go<00:00:31.609> with<00:00:31.640> good<00:00:32.029> chance

there you want to go with good chance

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.810 
there you want to go with good chance
good<00:00:32.509> chance<00:00:32.720> is<00:00:32.900> very<00:00:33.590> very<00:00:33.800> important<00:00:34.310> it's

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
good chance is very very important it's

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.430 
good chance is very very important it's
going<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.090> be<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.420> hot<00:00:35.780> definitely<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
going to be the hot definitely the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.650 
going to be the hot definitely the
second<00:00:36.770> highest<00:00:37.090> modifier<00:00:38.090> when<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:38.359> comes<00:00:38.510> to

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
second highest modifier when it comes to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.490 
second highest modifier when it comes to
dealing<00:00:38.960> damage<00:00:39.109> because<00:00:40.090> why<00:00:41.090> deal<00:00:41.570> one<00:00:42.320> time

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
dealing damage because why deal one time

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.869 
dealing damage because why deal one time
damage<00:00:42.890> when<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.160> can<00:00:43.280> deal<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.579> damage

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
damage when you can deal to damage

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.139 
damage when you can deal to damage
damage<00:00:44.440> pretty<00:00:45.440> straight<00:00:45.649> forward<00:00:46.149> from

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
damage pretty straight forward from

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.490 
damage pretty straight forward from
there<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:47.750> is<00:00:47.899> where<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:48.170> gets<00:00:48.260> pretty

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
there this is where it gets pretty

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.819 
there this is where it gets pretty
controversial<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:50.149> me<00:00:50.359> this<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.679> is

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
controversial but to me this is this is

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.669 
controversial but to me this is this is
kind<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.340> order<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.120> goes<00:00:53.239> okay<00:00:53.679> the

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
kind of the order that it goes okay the

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.619 
kind of the order that it goes okay the
third<00:00:54.949> most<00:00:55.219> important<00:00:55.789> stat<00:00:56.000> priority<00:00:56.269> is

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
third most important stat priority is

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.720 
third most important stat priority is
going<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.109> be<00:00:58.570> elemental<00:00:59.570> skill<00:00:59.839> damage

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
going to be elemental skill damage

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.750 
going to be elemental skill damage
equals<00:01:01.750> critical<00:01:02.750> hit<00:01:02.929> damage<00:01:03.430> but<00:01:04.430> i<00:01:04.460> would

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
equals critical hit damage but i would

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.680 
equals critical hit damage but i would
still<00:01:04.970> weigh<00:01:06.460> critical<00:01:07.460> or<00:01:07.700> sorry<00:01:07.940> skill

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
still weigh critical or sorry skill

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.200 
still weigh critical or sorry skill
damage<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.380> little<00:01:09.920> higher<00:01:10.159> than<00:01:10.549> critical<00:01:11.030> hit

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
damage a little higher than critical hit

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.200 
damage a little higher than critical hit
damage<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.079> little<00:01:12.470> bit<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:13.369> know<00:01:13.400> it

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
damage just a little bit you know it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.510 
damage just a little bit you know it
depends<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> item<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.070> how

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
depends on the item that it's on and how

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.520 
depends on the item that it's on and how
much<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.110> but<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.939> most<00:01:20.329> cases<00:01:20.540> base<00:01:21.229> damage

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
much it is but in most cases base damage

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.899 
much it is but in most cases base damage
will<00:01:22.100> outweigh<00:01:23.259> critical<00:01:24.259> hit<00:01:24.409> damage<00:01:24.909> but

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
will outweigh critical hit damage but

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.090 
will outweigh critical hit damage but
we'll<00:01:26.360> move<00:01:26.479> on<00:01:26.659> from<00:01:26.689> there<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.649> after<00:01:28.070> that

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
we'll move on from there and after that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.620 
we'll move on from there and after that
you're<00:01:28.340> gonna<00:01:28.430> go<00:01:28.640> with<00:01:28.790> attacks<00:01:29.119> me<00:01:29.329> know

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
you're gonna go with attacks me know

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.359 
you're gonna go with attacks me know
obviously<00:01:29.869> attack<00:01:30.439> speed<00:01:30.649> is<00:01:30.799> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.070> lowest

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
obviously attack speed is on the lowest

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.679 
obviously attack speed is on the lowest
on<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.520> totem<00:01:31.610> pole<00:01:31.880> because<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.390> makes<00:01:32.540> you

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
on the totem pole because it makes you

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.030 
on the totem pole because it makes you
attack<00:01:32.960> faster<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.770> doesn't<00:01:34.009> actually

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
attack faster but it doesn't actually

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.719 
attack faster but it doesn't actually
increase<00:01:34.700> your<00:01:34.969> damage<00:01:35.210> which<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.729> pretty

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
increase your damage which is pretty

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.420 
increase your damage which is pretty
much<00:01:37.850> useless<00:01:38.149> I'd<00:01:38.990> say<00:01:39.200> attack<00:01:39.500> speed<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.979> the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
much useless I'd say attack speed is the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.929 
much useless I'd say attack speed is the
best<00:01:40.820> stack<00:01:41.090> for<00:01:41.390> stacking<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:43.280> character

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
best stack for stacking a character

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.480 
best stack for stacking a character
sheet<00:01:44.090> damage<00:01:44.450> because<00:01:45.140> i<00:01:45.649> love<00:01:45.920> mental<00:01:46.310> skill

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
sheet damage because i love mental skill

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.920 
sheet damage because i love mental skill
damage<00:01:46.790> doesn't<00:01:47.060> actually<00:01:47.299> increase<00:01:47.750> that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
damage doesn't actually increase that

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.190 
damage doesn't actually increase that
elemental<00:01:48.710> skill<00:01:48.920> damage<00:01:49.189> increases<00:01:49.520> your

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
elemental skill damage increases your

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.219 
elemental skill damage increases your
your<00:01:51.200> actual<00:01:51.860> effective<00:01:52.430> damage<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.079> best

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
your actual effective damage so the best

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.649 
your actual effective damage so the best
example<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:54.950> can<00:01:54.979> use<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.520> let's<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.180> use<00:01:56.570> an

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
example I can use is let's just use an

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.620 
example I can use is let's just use an
ability<00:01:56.840> here<00:01:57.219> /<00:01:58.219> with<00:01:58.549> lighting<00:01:58.880> let's<00:01:59.479> say

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
ability here / with lighting let's say

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.690 
ability here / with lighting let's say
this<00:01:59.840> swing<00:02:00.170> here<00:02:00.200> there's<00:02:00.680> 3.2<00:02:01.250> million<00:02:01.460> down

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
this swing here there's 3.2 million down

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.149 
this swing here there's 3.2 million down
okay<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.359> that's<00:02:02.930> what<00:02:03.079> this<00:02:03.200> waste<00:02:03.439> guard<00:02:03.680> so

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
okay and that's what this waste guard so

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.190 
okay and that's what this waste guard so
six<00:02:04.609> your<00:02:04.759> site<00:02:04.909> increased<00:02:05.149> attack<00:02:05.390> speed<00:02:05.420> so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
six your site increased attack speed so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.749 
six your site increased attack speed so
when<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.560> click<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.490> lightning

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
when I click this and it's a lightning

you can control the rng is just being

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.590 
you can control the rng is just being

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
more efficient and being able to do

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.930 
more efficient and being able to do
things<00:05:19.630> quicker<00:05:20.230> and<00:05:20.700> that's<00:05:21.700> pretty<00:05:21.820> much

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
things quicker and that's pretty much

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.850 
things quicker and that's pretty much
how<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.180> goes<00:05:22.390> so<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.870> order<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.200> do<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.590> you

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
how it goes so in order to do that you

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.590 
how it goes so in order to do that you
need<00:05:23.950> to<00:05:24.190> do<00:05:24.280> more<00:05:24.460> damage<00:05:24.670> to<00:05:25.000> elites<00:05:25.330> because

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
need to do more damage to elites because

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.360 
need to do more damage to elites because
they<00:05:25.750> are<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:25.930> majority<00:05:26.260> of<00:05:26.560> those<00:05:27.160> are

increases damage against the leads by
thirty<00:05:34.930> percent<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.950> know<00:05:35.980> that<00:05:36.220> 4<00:05:36.550> million

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
thirty percent you know that 4 million

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.060 
thirty percent you know that 4 million
let's<00:05:37.330> say<00:05:37.510> formed<00:05:37.900> 4.8<00:05:38.380> million<00:05:38.560> damage<00:05:38.980> you

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
let's say formed 4.8 million damage you

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.440 
let's say formed 4.8 million damage you
lose<00:05:39.250> thirty<00:05:39.460> percent<00:05:39.670> for<00:05:39.850> dems<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.240> go<00:05:40.330> down

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
lose thirty percent for dems you go down

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.200 
lose thirty percent for dems you go down
to<00:05:40.480> 4.5<00:05:41.080> million<00:05:41.320> damage<00:05:41.740> or<00:05:42.220> hit<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.940> put<00:05:43.120> on

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
to 4.5 million damage or hit you put on

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.580 
to 4.5 million damage or hit you put on
this<00:05:43.390> do<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:43.660> do<00:05:43.780> thirty<00:05:44.020> percent<00:05:44.350> more

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
this do you do thirty percent more

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.400 
this do you do thirty percent more
damage<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.130> leads<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.610> that<00:05:46.270> 4.5<00:05:46.900> turns<00:05:47.260> into

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
damage to leads and that 4.5 turns into

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.590 
damage to leads and that 4.5 turns into
6<00:05:47.680> million<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.520> just<00:05:48.940> by<00:05:49.030> putting<00:05:49.270> on<00:05:49.480> these

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
6 million so just by putting on these

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.120 
6 million so just by putting on these
two<00:05:49.840> items<00:05:49.990> here<00:05:50.350> let's<00:05:50.710> just<00:05:50.860> see<00:05:50.920> if<00:05:50.950> this

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
two items here let's just see if this
