00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.610 

ok<00:00:39.620> that's<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> unit<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:42.200> looks<00:00:43.200> ugly

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
ok that's the unit right now looks ugly

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.600 
ok that's the unit right now looks ugly
the<00:00:44.250> biggest<00:00:44.460> problem<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> finding<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.600> boxes

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
the biggest problem is finding the boxes

the biggest problem is finding the boxes
hopefully<00:00:47.610> by<00:00:47.760> mid-summer<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.989> be

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
hopefully by mid-summer will be

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680 
hopefully by mid-summer will be
available<00:00:49.850> right<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.449> for

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
available right now it's just for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
available right now it's just for
testing<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.379> several<00:00:53.570> people<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.460> how

it's<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:03.290> since<00:01:04.290> last<00:01:04.530> year<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.280> we

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it's what I have since last year when we

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's what I have since last year when we
first<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.830> been<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> couple<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
first got it it's been a couple of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
first got it it's been a couple of
modifications<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.700> right<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.869> are

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
modifications and right now we are

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
modifications and right now we are
pretty<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> last<00:01:17.100> version<00:01:20.060> also

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
pretty much at the last version also

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.260 
pretty much at the last version also
might<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.869> able<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.650> another<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.520> maybe

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
might be able to have another one maybe

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.800 
might be able to have another one maybe
a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.930> smaller<00:01:25.259> than<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
a little bit smaller than this one as a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.149 
a little bit smaller than this one as a
dimension<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:29.540> 60<00:01:30.540> x<00:01:31.040> 45<00:01:32.040> x<00:01:32.490> 55<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.860> runs

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
dimension it's like 60 x 45 x 55 it runs

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
dimension it's like 60 x 45 x 55 it runs
on<00:01:35.340> 6<00:01:36.180> volts<00:01:38.000> 7.4<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.329> 11<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:41.009> gasoline<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on 6 volts 7.4 and 11 on gasoline it can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
on 6 volts 7.4 and 11 on gasoline it can
go<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.049> 6<00:01:43.530> volts<00:01:44.119> when<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> glow<00:01:47.570> 7.4

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
go on 6 volts when you go and glow 7.4

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.020 
go on 6 volts when you go and glow 7.4
volts<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:50.540> 11<00:01:51.540> volts<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.570> that's<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
volts or 11 volts so that's about it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:03:10.360 
volts or 11 volts so that's about it
ignition<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.380> let's<00:01:58.380> try<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.790> give<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> start

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.420 

as<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:11.969> or<00:03:12.269> six<00:03:12.629> fold<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:14.670> rolls<00:03:16.430> one

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
as you can see or six fold it rolls one

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.630 
as you can see or six fold it rolls one
point<00:03:17.790> two<00:03:17.969> amps<00:03:18.629> or<00:03:18.719> something<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.319> that

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
point two amps or something like that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:57.430 
point two amps or something like that
let's<00:03:20.640> switch<00:03:20.879> it<00:03:20.909> on<00:03:21.180> april's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.059 

it<00:03:58.440> idles<00:03:58.830> pretty<00:03:59.100> decent<00:03:59.610> around<00:03:59.970> 800<00:04:01.069> really

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
it idles pretty decent around 800 really

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.800 
it idles pretty decent around 800 really
nice<00:04:03.170> if<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.380> have<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.819> spinner<00:04:05.819> or<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.390> bigger
