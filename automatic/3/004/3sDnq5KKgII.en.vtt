00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello gadget or viewers you knew that 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.860
 Spain was a world power in the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.049
 field of video games so it continues 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.019
 as it is, that was at the beginning of the years 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.060
 80 when the video games had 8 bits 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.190
 they were 8 bits especially games for 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.860
 spectrum in what is known as the 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.150
 golden age of Spanish software all 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.370
 started in 1983 with the game the flea that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.500
 became known throughout the world under 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.419
 the name of played was a man 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.100
 different but at the same game there was in 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.620
 that time a lot of young people 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.659
 Spanish programmers that good 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.269
 they programmed almost for fun but with 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.179
 so much talent and creativity that they boosted 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.249
 to Spain to the first place of creation 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.319
 of video games across Europe only 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.289
 overcome by the United Kingdom- of that 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:54.530
 are companies like security operations 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.510
 soft top or soft made in spain dynamic 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.819
 devoured a lot of companies that during 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.949
 that space of time bloomed and 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.389
 they really took our people to the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.489
 summit and we do not even give ourselves 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.710
 account because for us it was 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.329
 in Spain there were Spanish games in 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.430
 other countries will have theirs but not 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.320
 The truth is that the Spaniards were the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.659
 better than there were games at that time 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.509
 For example, the adventures in 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.159
 jungle of livingston I suppose a game that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.020
 it was called Fred that he had the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.450
 particularity that every time the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.170
 you played the maps the stage was 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.429
 different 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.130
 different because it was generated 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.689
 randomly games like camelot word 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.509
 yours or the wars 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.880
 amy mus inavi nus navy move they were going 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.729
 together also from that time are also 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.649
 many sports games that had 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.270
 a lot of quality and in fact there are so many 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.819
 so good that they deserve a chapter 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 apart literally another day I talk to you about 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.630
 them one of the common denominators 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.720
 from this era apart from the originality 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.179
 and creativity was the difficulty these 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.600
 games will be very difficult games like 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.580
 phantoms or profe nation abu simbel were 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.590
 practically impossible to overcome anything 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.439
 what to do with what we have today and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.179
 that's because there were no tests 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.799
 is the figure of the testers that people 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.320
 normal that is dedicated to try a game 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.369
 to know if it is difficult is easy if it is 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.560
 funny that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.390
 in the programmers and of course how they 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.730
 it was known in the memory game because they 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.280
 it seemed all easy the culmination of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.819
 this time the top the most moment 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.459
 bright was in 1987 just four years 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.860
 then with the game the abbey of 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.560
 soft opera crime that game was based 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.819
 in the masterpiece of umberto echo the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.440
 name of the rose 'that also has a 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.269
 movie with sean connery and it was a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.879
 very funny graphic adventure very 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.780
 entertaining very novelty that really 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.120
 touched the roof and put an end to this era 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.310
 and at the beginning of the decline because 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.819
 after the 8 bits came the 16 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.709
 bits games on computers 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.599
 progressed they developed and improved 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.940
 and our companies did not know how to do 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.310
 this step they got hooked on the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.560
 spektrum did some tests in 16 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.720
 bits that did not work and in the end all 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.250
 they ended up going bankrupt or disappearing or 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.260
 having to reinvent himself to do 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.140
 different things but that talent for 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.700
 luck did not die he remained alive and revived the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.829
 After a few years with projects such 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.239
 exciting as pyro studios and games 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.080
 of such quality as for example 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.180
 commands 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.070
 that's another story that we may have 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.600
 also someday it was a very 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.160
 brief but from which we can be 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.500
 proud and all those people that like me 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.390
 He was present here and could live it in 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.220
 first person sure we have a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.620
 pleasant memory and with our cassettes 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.780
 with the spectrum I'm going to play the abbey 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.160
 of crime what good memories for in 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.210
 end that some day we were up there 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.210
 and because we can not go back
