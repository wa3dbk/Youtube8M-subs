image size too usually it's 80 x 80 it's
not<00:02:23.350> always<00:02:23.530> sometimes<00:02:23.799> they're<00:02:24.250> bigger<00:02:24.459> or

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
smaller just drag it over to make a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.150 
smaller just drag it over to make a
bigger<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.420> Center<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.980> one

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bigger so that you can Center it not one

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.620 
bigger so that you can Center it not one
could<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:33.459> bigger<00:02:33.670> I'm<00:02:34.000> not<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.510> make<00:02:34.569> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
could be bigger I'm not going to make it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.120 
could be bigger I'm not going to make it
that<00:02:34.840> much<00:02:34.870> bigger

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.490 

probably<00:02:41.130> 90<00:02:41.580> x<00:02:41.730> 90<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.120> bigger

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
probably 90 x 90 it's a little bigger

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.390
