00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.838
 We will explain to you how to put traditional Arabic make-up with distinction 

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:29.682
 Start by placing the concealer to hide the defects around the eyes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.756
 Use a sponge to extend the concealer well instead of using the powder 

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:47.268
 We advise you to provide it well so that the makeup does not appear thick 

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:55.038
 Draw a wide eyeliner line using a kohl brush 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:08.028
 Spread the mixture gently up to create a sort of gradient between black and gray 

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.234
 Then they used a cream shadow 

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:47.077
 Do not approach the shadow of the eyelashes 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.057
 And extend the shadow up and up 

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:02.299
 Make sure you mix the colors well to keep the look innocent 

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.901
 Place a silver "hyaliter" under the eyebrows 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.835
 Be dense in the upper area 

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:44.466
 And soft in the lower area to blend with the blue shade 

00:03:10.068 --> 00:03:14.315
 Silver Hyaliter may be used in the corner of the inner eyes as shown on the screen 

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:16.608
 The eyes look wider 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.400
 Fix the kohl that you placed first by placing a dark gray or black shade 

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.407
 Using a sponge rod 

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:04.240
 Put back a blue shadow and mix colors carefully 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.771
 Kohl gives a distinctive shape of the eye 

00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:56.311
 So place it using a brush for kohl as shown on the screen 

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:13.502
 Also draw a line as a broad eyeliner under the lower lashes and gather them together 

00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:20.149
 This kind of kohl makes the eyes appear wider 

00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:44.620
 Put a blue shadow open inside the eyes 

00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:05.320
 Also put a little mascara before selecting synthetic lashes 

00:06:17.108 --> 00:06:20.975
 Artificial lashes may be measured and cut off on request 

00:06:25.924 --> 00:06:29.278
 Then measure them and adjust them again if necessary 

00:06:33.403 --> 00:06:38.255
 Place the glue on the false eyelashes according to the usual rules 

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.363
 Make sure they are well pasted 

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:49.368
 When developing false eyelashes make sure they are as close as possible to the roots of the real lashes 

00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:51.878
 Apply as much as possible the roots of the real lashes to make the mixture look natural 

00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:11.033
 They used a bit of black shade to mix it with kohl at the bottom of the eye
