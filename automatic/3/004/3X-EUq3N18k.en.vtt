that I can't really play with like one
or<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:33.870> subscribers<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.790> would

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
or two subscribers because then it would

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340 
or two subscribers because then it would
be<00:00:36.030> unfair<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> other<00:00:36.780> people<00:00:37.170> because

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
be unfair for the other people because

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
be unfair for the other people because
then<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> couldn't<00:00:37.890> play<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> stuff

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
like that so too I guess slow down all
of<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:42.149> requests<00:00:42.540> play<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.230> i<00:00:43.440> bought

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
live streaming the event right here on
YouTube<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.979> working<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.760> testing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
YouTube I was working when I was testing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.770 
YouTube I was working when I was testing
it<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:13.710> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> spotty<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it out but it was kind of spotty and I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.320 
it out but it was kind of spotty and I
don't<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.320> trust<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> works

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
don't really trust it so if it works

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
don't really trust it so if it works
then<00:01:18.750> I'll<00:01:18.869> live<00:01:19.110> stream<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
then I'll live stream it and if it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.580 
then I'll live stream it and if it
doesn't<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.210> won't<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.930> no<00:01:22.110> guarantees<00:01:22.560> on

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
doesn't then I won't so no guarantees on

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.399 
doesn't then I won't so no guarantees on
that<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:24.150> unable<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> play<00:01:25.350> for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
some reason or if the server is maxed

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
some reason or if the server is maxed
out<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.189> two<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.759> it
