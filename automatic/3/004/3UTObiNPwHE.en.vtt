a water characters on screen there

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.850 
a water characters on screen there
aren't<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.700> street<00:01:53.090> maybe<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.590> probably

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
aren't a street maybe this is probably

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.890 
aren't a street maybe this is probably
Iraq<00:01:55.310> or<00:01:55.549> something<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.540> top<00:01:56.720> right

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
Iraq or something on the top right

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.670 
Iraq or something on the top right
corner<00:01:57.110> there's<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.680> bee<00:01:57.920> mp3<00:01:58.040> or<00:01:59.380> some<00:02:00.380> kind<00:02:00.590> of
