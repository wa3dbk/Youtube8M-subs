00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 belenenses and that if it proves of the competition for the bank of Brazil we are here with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 a stumbling block leader who deserves Portuguese punishment 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.829
 You're lucky, how are you supposed to get ready? 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.359
 I think it's okay to go down falcon and study. 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.170
 ever 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.150
 people with a topic we do not keep touching too much to take a day and 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 study your score for example study your part rule your part of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.449
 back 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.990
 mix content sometimes it loses 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 Do not even focus, study. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 effectively saving it should be saved 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.510
 How do you evaluate the program? 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 of the competition 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.080
 composed with a quiet program 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.210
 on that day in the pattern of the action of the saints 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.790
 have regency agreement back 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.660
 if this action of words 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.920
 and they also placed a topic that I thought I was very careful 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.150
 official writing 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.300
 careful of the official newsroom 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.080
 because she likes to charge always calm that alone and writing 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 official is not the production of text the donation will be part memorandum letter to 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.510
 rat 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.020
 try to give some of this 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 according to a new degradation of the presence of public 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.930
 minimum length of study 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.450
 the minimum period of study is a year 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.939
 once a day 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.099
 of three to four hours always focusing on the new moon topic use only once and 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.730
 sevenson portuguese 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.370
 and what is suggested major east-east contest professionals is 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.030
 that the person chooses a subject per day in Portuguese would not be 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 different shot a day of the week study pointed 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 but 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.910
 only 0 to 0 with the first would be the lowest price but the rush 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.830
 answers the questions 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.009
 without any not adequately 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.609
 we always try to have attention in the command are if he wants 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.020
 the only one of the only correct 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.250
 not bothered about the program as the issue that afterwards 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 the company sometimes leaving the taste 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.199
 calms Portuguese language foments resembles conflict is not 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.249
 mechanical 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.849
 photo of this subject that requires a lot of attention has also grammatical logic 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.409
 many people do not have time to study is the course or does not have financial resources 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.420
 for this 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.859
 is recommended to the internet ' 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.329
 without reliable website since the person 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.209
 know but do not think it comes with the source if the template is appropriate and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.799
 especially now 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.319
 search the internet 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.639
 with seven reliable 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.609
 and always focusing on banking 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.399
 the flag was generally skipped was this 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.360
 to collect 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.210
 now essentially one has to try to ask the questions of the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.559
 efficiency of the carlos chagas foundation 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.559
 the practice of previous tests this bench that is recommended 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.180
 would be fundamental grounded in the south 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.590
 know that 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.029
 that fall in the test 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.630
 and so he knows what he wants 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.679
 he has to seek to make previous claims previous evidence 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.900
 always focusing on the band he will have control 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.070
 than studying 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.030
 and do not waste time on things that never 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.910
 five years to bring Japanese already studies 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.910
 and always on the bench the crying questions of the bank itself 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.049
 peter siemsen simulated is present are also bigger says it all 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.559
 you give the person 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.709
 in this curve how to develop simulated knowledge that is a 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.249
 work with interpretation 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:24.249
 reading is fundamental 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.419
 and color-coded questions and simulated questions of 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.189
 newspaper for example in this important 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.819
 materials are indicative pre-study 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.739
 materials but rely on this biome 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.499
 It's the magic of a bag left 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.319
 and any act of the book also the suspects is always interesting because 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.659
 I can not do 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.000
 I remain in doubt 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.430
 when the bands suggest some bibliography have always been the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.379
 authors she leave me her fists 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.590
 is the personal support programmatic content and that should have attention 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.259
 redoubled candidates 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.179
 is already following the average standard that the banking has already been defined is foundation 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:03.219
 Carlos Chagas 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.219
 where he takes great care with terms such as agreement 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.379
 the partex polozzi attested hall 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.510
 requirement 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.429
 I graze 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.979
 punctuation 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.339
 of deer preaching since it is also associated with regional peace. 

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.229
 cer 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.390
 they put a phrase with a deer 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.320
 and ptp red render spelling spelling even reading is the use of 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.460
 uncles in the young suit 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.469
 the situation is also required 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.659
 but more than interpretation it is necessary to work hard because the quotation of 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.740
 close 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.590
 This is going to be established, sir. 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.840
 until the end, do not make parents let you sit down 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.590
 is of the subscribers and mix well is not that they 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.620
 if you ask for a good contest, break the bank of Brazil 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.389
 they call it the multiple dice always one with the help of vacancies 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.230
 if they treat the Portuguese language as a target 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.780
 today that it does not stay in that area in the study of the sessions, because it already 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.680
 it's an old thing 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.940
 the Portuguese thyme test questions work with more logical and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.919
 interpretation of text and reading is fundamental 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.020
 good luck 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.520
 extra chic shaken sampdoria belt 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.710
 do not miss this scene said it required more money to beto
