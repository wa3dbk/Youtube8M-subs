I can use a lot my hold or darker wax
that<00:01:47.020> doesn't<00:01:47.500> it's<00:01:48.490> not<00:01:48.550> good<00:01:48.820> enough<00:01:48.970> for

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
that doesn't it's not good enough for

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.470 
that doesn't it's not good enough for
the<00:01:49.210> candles<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:50.730> also<00:01:51.730> like<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.060> insert<00:01:52.330> the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
the candles I also like to insert the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
foundation into the frames as quick as

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.060 
foundation into the frames as quick as
possible<00:01:55.110> while<00:01:56.110> they're<00:01:56.290> nice<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.500> soft

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.060 

water<00:02:03.070> still<00:02:03.430> warm<00:02:03.640> they're<00:02:03.820> very<00:02:04.000> flexible

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.320 

as<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.340> wax<00:02:12.790> cools<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.690> gets<00:02:14.020> much<00:02:14.230> more<00:02:14.440> stiff

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
as the wax cools it gets much more stiff

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.910 
as the wax cools it gets much more stiff
it's<00:02:16.330> much<00:02:16.540> more<00:02:16.840> difficult<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> insert<00:02:17.709> into

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's much more difficult to insert into

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's much more difficult to insert into
the<00:02:18.130> frames<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:22.120> while<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.480> warm<00:02:23.100> very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
the frames but while it's warm very

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.090 
the frames but while it's warm very
simple<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:27.750> that's<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:28.959> folks<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.620> hope<00:02:29.980> this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
simple and that's all folks I hope this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.120 
simple and that's all folks I hope this
