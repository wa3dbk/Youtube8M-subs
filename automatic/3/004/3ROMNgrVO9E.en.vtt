guitarist and so on he was all about

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.260

taking<00:00:54.770> on<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> persona<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:55.610> I<00:00:55.879> thought<00:00:56.149> would

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
taking on a persona that I thought would

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.060

fill in some area in which I thought

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.709 
fill in some area in which I thought
that<00:00:58.250> was<00:00:58.370> lacking<00:00:58.640> but<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.180> hope<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.539> makes

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
that was lacking but I hope it makes

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.510 
that was lacking but I hope it makes
sense<00:01:00.020> when<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.260> say<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.860> when<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.010> felt<00:01:01.340> like<00:01:01.399> I

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
sense when I say that when I felt like I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520 
sense when I say that when I felt like I
was<00:01:01.789> finished<00:01:02.149> playing<00:01:02.420> one<00:01:02.660> role<00:01:02.960> I'd<00:01:03.260> feel

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
was finished playing one role I'd feel

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.260 
was finished playing one role I'd feel
kind<00:01:03.770> of<00:01:03.800> naked<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.369> incomplete<00:01:04.910> until<00:01:05.239> I

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
kind of naked and incomplete until I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.540 
kind of naked and incomplete until I
found<00:01:05.509> another<00:01:05.869> one<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.830> would<00:01:06.950> be<00:01:07.070> easy<00:01:07.280> to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
found another one it would be easy to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.370 
found another one it would be easy to
think<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.180> about<00:01:08.450> fitting<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:09.110> but

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
think that this is about fitting in but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.680 
think that this is about fitting in but
it's<00:01:09.530> really<00:01:09.619> about<00:01:09.979> definition<00:01:10.820> I've<00:01:11.330> always

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
it's really about definition I've always

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
some reason a definition that would

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.410 
some reason a definition that would

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.419 
purposes I'm just some guy you'll know
that<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.110> be<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.289> disconcerting<00:01:42.740> moment

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
that it can be a disconcerting moment

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.729 
that it can be a disconcerting moment
and<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.270> suppose<00:01:44.630> that's<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.080> appealing<00:01:45.530> thing

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:45.739 
and I suppose that's the appealing thing

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.290 
and I suppose that's the appealing thing
about<00:01:46.009> taking<00:01:46.280> on<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> role<00:01:46.910> or<00:01:47.270> a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
about taking on a role or a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.419 
about taking on a role or a
pre-established<00:01:47.720> identity<00:01:48.679> of<00:01:48.830> sorts<00:01:49.190> you

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
pre-established identity of sorts you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.309 
pre-established identity of sorts you
know<00:01:49.910> what<00:01:50.090> you're<00:01:50.239> supposed<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.660> want<00:01:50.989> and

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
know what you're supposed to want and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.020 
know what you're supposed to want and
how<00:01:51.500> you're<00:01:51.679> supposed<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.069> act<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.880> don't

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
how you're supposed to act you don't

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.880 
how you're supposed to act you don't
have<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.420> decide<00:01:53.720> these<00:01:53.959> things<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:54.500> yourself

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
have to decide these things for yourself

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.219 
have to decide these things for yourself
quite<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.340> much<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:56.330> I'm<00:01:56.479> sure<00:01:56.660> I<00:01:56.720> know<00:01:56.899> what<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
quite so much now I'm sure I know what a

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.809 
quite so much now I'm sure I know what a
lot<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.679> are<00:01:57.830> thinking<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.580> one

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
lot of you are thinking that one

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.580 
lot of you are thinking that one
shouldn't<00:01:59.149> try<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.479> define<00:01:59.899> himself<00:02:00.289> in<00:02:00.440> this

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
shouldn't try to define himself in this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.589 
shouldn't try to define himself in this
way<00:02:00.830> because<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.489> should<00:02:01.610> allow<00:02:01.849> yourself<00:02:02.360> to

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
way because you should allow yourself to

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.229 
way because you should allow yourself to
truly<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.229> yourself<00:02:03.380> well<00:02:04.369> that's<00:02:04.580> well<00:02:04.910> but

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
truly be yourself well that's well but

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:06.850 
truly be yourself well that's well but
be<00:02:05.390> yourself<00:02:05.539> can<00:02:06.050> sound<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.349> kind<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.739> an

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
be yourself can sound like kind of an

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.710 
be yourself can sound like kind of an
empty<00:02:07.039> term<00:02:07.369> especially<00:02:08.119> if<00:02:08.209> you're<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.479> sure

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
empty term especially if you're not sure

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.089 
empty term especially if you're not sure
if<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.959> trust<00:02:09.229> your<00:02:09.380> own<00:02:09.500> judgment

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
if you trust your own judgment

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.160 
if you trust your own judgment
so<00:02:10.849> what<00:02:11.030> could<00:02:11.209> make<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.540> want<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> try<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so what could make you want to try a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.100 
so what could make you want to try a
different<00:02:12.440> identity<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.489> first<00:02:13.700> place

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
different identity in the first place

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.150 
different identity in the first place
sometimes<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.500> take<00:02:15.709> on<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> role

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
sometimes you want to take on a role

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.130 
sometimes you want to take on a role
simply<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.150> look<00:02:17.360> over<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.780> someone

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
simply because you look over at someone

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.869 
simply because you look over at someone
at<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.379> diner<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.640> like

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
at the diner and you want to be like

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.729 
at the diner and you want to be like
them<00:02:20.120> because<00:02:20.540> for<00:02:20.569> whatever<00:02:20.930> reason<00:02:21.530> you

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
them because for whatever reason you

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.380 
them because for whatever reason you
assume<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.099> they<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> more<00:02:22.819> interesting

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
assume that they have a more interesting

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
assume that they have a more interesting
and<00:02:23.540> fulfilling<00:02:23.900> life<00:02:24.170> than<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.590> do

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and fulfilling life than you do

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.950 
and fulfilling life than you do
sometimes<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.060> get<00:02:26.150> tired<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.600> being<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
sometimes you get tired of being the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.900 
sometimes you get tired of being the
sort<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> person<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.860> freaks<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.520> ease

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
sort of person that freaks out to ease

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.090 
sort of person that freaks out to ease
and<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.510> try<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> be<00:02:29.990> like<00:02:30.140> someone<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.650> TV

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and so you try to be like someone on TV

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.860 
and so you try to be like someone on TV
that<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.520> able<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> keep<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.180> cool<00:02:32.360> head

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
that is able to keep a cool head

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.990 
that is able to keep a cool head
I<00:02:32.900> found<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.710> personally<00:02:34.370> I've<00:02:34.550> wanted<00:02:34.850> to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
I found that personally I've wanted to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.850 
I found that personally I've wanted to
take<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> new<00:02:35.660> identity<00:02:35.870> because<00:02:36.650> there's

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
take on a new identity because there's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.320 
take on a new identity because there's
this<00:02:36.980> weird<00:02:37.220> part<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.670> my<00:02:37.790> brains<00:02:38.060> that

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
this weird part of my brains that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.370 
this weird part of my brains that
believes<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.960> will<00:02:39.020> somehow

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
believes that this will somehow

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.590 
believes that this will somehow
magically<00:02:39.860> erase<00:02:40.430> every<00:02:40.820> stupid<00:02:41.180> thing<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.570> did

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
magically erase every stupid thing I did

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.930 
magically erase every stupid thing I did
with<00:02:41.870> my<00:02:42.020> last<00:02:42.260> identity<00:02:42.800> but<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.460> think<00:02:43.730> most

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
with my last identity but I think most

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.670 
with my last identity but I think most
of<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.210> time<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.690> would<00:02:44.900> guess<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.380> lot<00:02:45.560> of

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
of the time I would guess that a lot of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.260 
of the time I would guess that a lot of
people<00:02:46.010> simply<00:02:46.280> don't<00:02:46.640> believe<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:47.180> they

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
people simply don't believe that they

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.000 
people simply don't believe that they
could<00:02:47.420> develop<00:02:47.540> an<00:02:47.930> appealing<00:02:48.350> identity<00:02:48.860> by

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
could develop an appealing identity by

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.580 
could develop an appealing identity by
themselves<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.880> don't<00:02:50.570> know<00:02:50.870> if<00:02:51.050> anyone<00:02:51.380> else

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
themselves I don't know if anyone else

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.860 
themselves I don't know if anyone else
thinks<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.070> much<00:02:52.250> about<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:52.790> sometimes<00:02:53.720> I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
thinks that much about this sometimes I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.450 
thinks that much about this sometimes I
wonder<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.380> lot<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> people<00:02:54.980> pay<00:02:55.220> more

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
wonder if a lot of people pay more

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.740 
wonder if a lot of people pay more
attention<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> kind<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.360> person<00:02:56.720> that

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
attention to the kind of person that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.480 
attention to the kind of person that
they<00:02:56.960> don't<00:02:57.260> want<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> be<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.130> then<00:02:58.310> whatever

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
they don't want to be and then whatever

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.090 
they don't want to be and then whatever
is<00:02:58.790> left<00:02:59.030> over<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.660> what<00:02:59.900> they<00:03:00.080> are<00:03:00.230> well<00:03:01.070> I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
don't want to be someone who sits around

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.250 
don't want to be someone who sits around
worrying<00:03:05.030> about<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.050> at<00:03:06.140> the
