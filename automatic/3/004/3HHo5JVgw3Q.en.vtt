Jenkins<00:00:50.910> only<00:00:51.120> y'all<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.629> base<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.410> pair

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
Jenkins only y'all gonna base the pair

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
Jenkins only y'all gonna base the pair
design<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> modern<00:00:53.219> warfare<00:00:53.489> 2<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.870> will

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
design a modern warfare 2 it really will

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.650 
design a modern warfare 2 it really will
be<00:00:55.050> best<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.590> compare<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> was

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.590 

ok<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> m16<00:01:01.440> basically<00:01:01.980> m16<00:01:02.670> West<00:01:03.030> looking<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
ok the m16 basically m16 West looking is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
ok the m16 basically m16 West looking is
looking<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.760> one<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.150> four

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
looking like it's like a one to four

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
looking like it's like a one to four
bars<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.890> say<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> person<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
bars so I would say if a person is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
bars so I would say if a person is
pretty<00:01:08.909> close<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.600> might<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:10.560> away<00:01:10.680> with

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pretty close to you might get away with
