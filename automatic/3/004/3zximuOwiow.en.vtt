00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
notice that the the tubes that come on

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.280 
notice that the the tubes that come on
these<00:01:21.979> axles<00:01:22.460> are<00:01:22.610> not<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.850> true<00:01:23.360> three<00:01:23.690> inch<00:01:23.870> OD

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
these axles are not a true three inch OD

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.670 
these axles are not a true three inch OD
they're<00:01:25.159> 290<00:01:26.000> something<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.930> what<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.470> have

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
they're 290 something so what you have

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.149 
they're 290 something so what you have
to<00:01:27.710> do<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.780> basically<00:01:29.780> cut<00:01:30.740> them<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
to do is basically cut them to the

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.090 
to do is basically cut them to the
length<00:01:31.370> you<00:01:31.490> need<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.540> you'll<00:01:32.780> have<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.110> turn

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
length you need and you'll have to turn

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.200 
length you need and you'll have to turn
you<00:01:34.790> know<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.940> collar<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.320> end<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:37.210> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
you know a collar on the end of it to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.990 
you know a collar on the end of it to
prepare<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.290> go<00:01:39.470> into<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.190> sleeve<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
prepare it to go into the sleeve and and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.370 
prepare it to go into the sleeve and and
also<00:01:41.479> you'll<00:01:41.900> have<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.909> cut<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.150> idea<00:01:45.140> of

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
also you'll have to cut on the idea of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.370 
also you'll have to cut on the idea of
it<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.799> little<00:01:46.520> pocket<00:01:46.790> for<00:01:47.090> your<00:01:47.420> axle<00:01:47.930> seal<00:01:48.140> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
it a little pocket for your axle seal to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
it a little pocket for your axle seal to
go<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.150> sit<00:01:50.420> back<00:01:50.570> in

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
go in and that's going to sit back in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.620 
go in and that's going to sit back in
here<00:01:51.080> like<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.060> all<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.090> needs<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> be

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
here like this and all that needs to be

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.130 
here like this and all that needs to be
done<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.080> lathe<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.990> once<00:01:56.990> you

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
done on a lathe and then once you

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.590 
done on a lathe and then once you
determine<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.799> length<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.909> axle<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.450> you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
determine the length of axle that you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.300 
determine the length of axle that you
want<00:01:59.840> for<00:02:00.049> whatever<00:02:00.229> application<00:02:00.560> you're

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
want for whatever application you're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.719 
want for whatever application you're
using<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.780> press<00:02:03.110> them<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:03.740> or<00:02:03.950> drive

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
using you press them in there or drive

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.300 
using you press them in there or drive
them<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.210> hammer

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
them in hammer

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.070 
them in hammer
sometimes<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.580> could<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> piece<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
sometimes you could get a piece of like

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000 
sometimes you could get a piece of like
one<00:02:10.289> inch<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:10.709> thread<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.370> try<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.860> pull<00:02:13.860> them

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
one inch all thread and try to pull them

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.970

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it and pull them in that way I've done

it and pull them in that way I've done
this<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.019> couple<00:02:25.140> times<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.010> used<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> drive

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
this a couple times and I used the drive

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.870 
this a couple times and I used the drive
method<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.690> takes<00:02:28.080> three<00:02:28.410> dudes<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.670> bunch

method it takes three dudes and a bunch

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.020 
method it takes three dudes and a bunch
of<00:02:30.030> muscle<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.739> sometimes<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.860> torch<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.519> it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
of muscle and sometimes a torch but it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
of muscle and sometimes a torch but it
seems<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.390> work<00:02:33.420> pretty<00:02:33.569> good<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:35.640> also

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
seems to work pretty good it's also

to look like this this is the same exact
thing<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:23.639> here<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.239> where<00:03:24.420> we

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
thing and here you can see where we

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.160 
thing and here you can see where we
turned<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:26.160> tubes<00:03:26.910> down<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.359> fit<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:27.989> and

turned the tubes down to fit in here and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.120 
turned the tubes down to fit in here and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
because once we get in the machine shop

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.569 
because once we get in the machine shop
it's<00:04:01.260> probably<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> be<00:04:01.799> too<00:04:01.980> loud<00:04:02.160> to

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
it's probably going to be too loud to

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:21.210 
it's probably going to be too loud to
show<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.120> what<00:04:03.329> we're<00:04:03.480> doing
