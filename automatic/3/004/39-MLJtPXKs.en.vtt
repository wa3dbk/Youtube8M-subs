00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.570
 so hello and welcome to the guide 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.389
 Regarding our chat system which 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.880
 we start from map 4 on the portal server 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.870
 use 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.789
 not much has changed fundamentally 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 but we have changed that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.439
 Chatsystem extended at some places 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.210
 or simplified I start directly once 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 in which I briefly open the chat 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 and you are actually looking right when you are 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 first on the server comes in the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.399
 welcome message among others 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 Information regarding the symbols and 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 Letters in the chat before the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.680
 respective user names appear 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 For one thing, we have three different ones 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.260
 For one, we have the local channel 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.629
 everyone sends the chat of the 150 blocks 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.000
 that within that radius it is hear 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.960
 the message and the outside 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 of course not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 the global chat of the worlds 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 that means everyone will be on the server 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.280
 it is in a certain region is eg 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 Receiving chat messages 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 the city channel issued this hear 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 Of course, only people in the same 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.799
 city ​​group are like oneself 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.799
 of course, that is a prerequisite 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 belongs to a city then you see 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.159
 over it a few flags the the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.310
 ranking indicate the appropriate person 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 So we do not have those anymore 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.820
 ellenlangen city names and channel 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.680
 to stand in front of a line of text when I am 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.450
 Now here's a short write what it is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 actually kept quite short but 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.420
 we now only have one flag left 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.939
 represents the ranking 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.330
 and indeed the stranger has a monochrome 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.310
 gray flag each has a city for 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.830
 the citizens and a normal accordingly 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.290
 the city colors decorated flag and 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.020
 the city council has an extra yellow 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.039
 point underneath we had investors 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.090
 have a completely red square flag 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.890
 of course you are not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.289
 should know more by heart what 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 does this flag mean which group 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.069
 the one who is currently chatting with me 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.300
 you can also talk in chat over 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.470
 drive this flag and you see yes 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.519
 what rank this person has 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.310
 then you have already seen 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.870
 the cheetah will be the one 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.190
 initial letter of the channel actually 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 used if you but again exactly 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.690
 want to know what that means can you 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.190
 drive over it too 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 otherwise there is the possibility about 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.220
 the names of the corresponding people too 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.590
 drive and then click on it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.239
 appears in chat for private 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.220
 news system already one 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.020
 Pre-made message where you only 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.520
 still 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.780
 a text needs to be changed 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.760
 between the different Chechens 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.260
 has not changed roughly it gives that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.880
 global chat the per / g resp 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.850
 / globally available then there is the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.520
 local chat with / l resp 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.720
 / local is reachable and the city ​​chief 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.560
 I'll go back to that later 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.520
 will go in because the something different 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.220
 reached there are as before 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.030
 you can see for example now from 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.450
 chat locally 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.360
 a direct message to another 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.240
 write chat channels in which you / l 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:34.569
 or local writes and behind it immediately 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.130
 The text will then be short in the channel 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.319
 something written down where you go 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.640
 but you generally wanted to have that 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.110
 channel did not change if so 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.300
 Now I'm still typing 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.340
 in the global chat I'm switching now 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.500
 once briefly in the local chat in the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.959
 I just do not write any text behind it 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.180
 and if I type something without it now 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.340
 a command to dictate land is 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.709
 also directly in the local chat at the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.360
 city ​​channel is a little different 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.730
 as before , every city has a something 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.239
 modified command and indeed it starts 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.640
 on with t shirt and then that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.790
 initial letter of the city where you at 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.650
 belongs in the case of fog falls to 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.120
 write an example 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:26.320
 / Tr in the case of rätia we write in 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.690
 case of semmer 1 td and in the case of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.350
 storm case ts the rest is trivial too 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.270
 to command the others that means you can 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.900
 as well as a direct text 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.370
 write or switch to the channel 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.200
 I'm already on that 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.840
 private message system received 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.270
 that by clicking on the user name 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.580
 already a ready-made text ready 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.360
 you can if you write one to 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.050
 also with / he directly the last 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.729
 who wrote you an answer 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.680
 we also have one in the chat system 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.100
 function built it for you 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.979
 makes it easy to present items in chat 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.440
 for example, to initiate a trade after the 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.010
 motto who would like to swear this 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.190
 to buy 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.210
 as an example , one holds best 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.840
 an object in the hand of the man 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.060
 in the chat and around this 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.460
 item to advertise in chat now 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.410
 I simply tip my sentence who wants 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:38.560
 that and then percent item all big 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:44.380
 written percent now buy as 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.449
 Example and you see I had one 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.099
 sword in hand and when I over 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.520
 the name driver, you also see the 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.160
 data of the sword 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.320
 We also have the chat system 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.300
 flags installed have also one 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.300
 replacement day and in each case percent 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
 City name 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:13.879
 and then the flag turns into a chat 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.869
 since that's it from the chat system and 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.219
 the basics 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:19.809
 I wish you much fun 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.809
 Try it until next time
