today's<00:00:00.539> topic<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.110> kind<00:00:01.410> of<00:00:01.560> vague<00:00:01.800> and

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
today's topic is kind of vague and

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.370 
today's topic is kind of vague and
ambiguous<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.879> don't<00:00:03.510> know<00:00:03.600> exactly<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:04.259> it

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
ambiguous I don't know exactly what it

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.780 
ambiguous I don't know exactly what it
is<00:00:04.500> but<00:00:04.770> there's<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.130> bunch<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.460> stuff<00:00:05.640> we're

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
is but there's a bunch of stuff we're

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.490 
is but there's a bunch of stuff we're
going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> talk<00:00:06.029> about<00:00:06.420> one<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:06.960> them<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.350> going

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
going to talk about one of them is going

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.100 
going to talk about one of them is going
to<00:00:07.560> be<00:00:07.620> ATX<00:00:08.280> or<00:00:08.760> more<00:00:09.030> specifically<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
to be ATX or more specifically the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.499 
to be ATX or more specifically the
changes<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.849> being

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
changes that are going that are being

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.200 
changes that are going that are being
undergone<00:00:13.139> by<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> ATX<00:00:14.009> standard<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.670> then

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
undergone by the ATX standard and then

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.400 
undergone by the ATX standard and then
the<00:00:15.240> next<00:00:15.630> thing<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.170> bit<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the next thing is it's a bit of a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.740 
the next thing is it's a bit of a
coming-out<00:00:16.800> party<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:18.000> Coolermaster

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
coming-out party for the Coolermaster

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.950 
coming-out party for the Coolermaster
1/2<00:00:18.990> X<00:00:19.350> which<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.550> ATX<00:00:21.029> case<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.720> again

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
1/2 X which is an ATX case but again

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.800 
1/2 X which is an ATX case but again
it's<00:00:22.380> along<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> lines<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.519> new<00:00:24.269> ATX

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's along the lines of a new ATX

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's along the lines of a new ATX
standard<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.439> until<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.070> didn't<00:00:26.609> really

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
standard that until now didn't really

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.269 
standard that until now didn't really
exist<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.869> why<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.470> start<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
exist so why don't I start with a bit of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.150 
exist so why don't I start with a bit of
a<00:00:29.460> history<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.390> first<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.949> left

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a history here first of all on your left

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
a history here first of all on your left
my<00:00:32.399> right<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> micro<00:00:33.870> ATX<00:00:34.050> motherboard

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
my right we have a micro ATX motherboard

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.819 
my right we have a micro ATX motherboard
this<00:00:35.219> motherboard<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.350> standard

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this motherboard is it can be standard

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.139 
this motherboard is it can be standard
width<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.000> actually

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
width so you can see that it's actually

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
width so you can see that it's actually
a<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.809> narrower<00:00:40.020> than<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.530> standard

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a little bit narrower than a standard

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.369 
a little bit narrower than a standard
ATX<00:00:41.250> board<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.329> wider<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> then

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
ATX board but it can be wider and then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190 
ATX board but it can be wider and then
it's<00:00:43.680> only<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.550> expansion<00:00:45.149> slots<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.960> that's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it's only for expansion slots so that's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
it's only for expansion slots so that's
a<00:00:46.320> micro<00:00:46.620> ATX<00:00:46.770> board<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:48.000> pretty<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
a micro ATX board that's pretty much the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.410 
a micro ATX board that's pretty much the
only<00:00:48.629> difference<00:00:49.140> next<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.700> standard

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
only difference next we have a standard

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
only difference next we have a standard
ATX<00:00:51.899> board<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.219> MSI<00:00:53.610> motherboard

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
ATX board so this is an MSI motherboard

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
ATX board so this is an MSI motherboard
you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> biggest<00:00:55.170> key<00:00:55.530> difference

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you can see the biggest key difference

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
you can see the biggest key difference
is<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.539> three<00:00:57.809> four<00:00:58.050> five

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is that it has one two three four five

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.889 
is that it has one two three four five
six<00:00:58.469> seven<00:00:59.070> expansion<00:00:59.550> slots<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.660> full

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
six seven expansion slots that's a full

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.460 
six seven expansion slots that's a full
ATX<00:01:01.350> board<00:01:01.680> next<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.149> well<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
ATX board next we have well this is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.539 
ATX board next we have well this is
where<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:04.979> getting<00:01:05.070> into<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
where we start getting into the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
where we start getting into the
territory<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.600> exactly<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.500> gigabyte

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
territory of what exactly is it gigabyte

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.850 
territory of what exactly is it gigabyte
is<00:01:08.460> calling<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.000> motherboard<00:01:09.330> XL<00:01:10.110> ATX<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
is calling this motherboard XL ATX and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
is calling this motherboard XL ATX and
what<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> standard<00:01:13.320> width

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
what it is is it is a standard width

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
what it is is it is a standard width
board<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.970> compare<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
board so if we compare it you can see it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
board so if we compare it you can see it
is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> same<00:01:17.130> width<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:17.700> ATX<00:01:18.090> board<00:01:18.420> but

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is the same width as an ATX board but

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.090 
is the same width as an ATX board but
the<00:01:19.770> length<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.810> slot<00:01:22.200> longer

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the length is actually one slot longer

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
the length is actually one slot longer
so<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> try<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.990> hold<00:01:25.200> these

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so here I'm going to try and hold these

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
so here I'm going to try and hold these
up<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.610> illustrates<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
up in a way that illustrates that a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
up in a way that illustrates that a
little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:27.900> better<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.189> can

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
little bit better there you go so can

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
little bit better there you go so can
you<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.820> yeah<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.900> once<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.740> longer

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you see now yeah it is once lot longer

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
you see now yeah it is once lot longer
so<00:01:32.250> while<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.299> motherboard<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.590> has

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
so while this motherboard actually has

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.940 
so while this motherboard actually has
only<00:01:35.579> seven<00:01:36.000> expansion<00:01:36.570> slots<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
only seven expansion slots there is one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
only seven expansion slots there is one
vacant<00:01:38.579> spot<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> top<00:01:39.869> where

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
vacant spot up here at the top where

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
vacant spot up here at the top where
they<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.860> theoretically<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.700> an

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
they could theoretically put an

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.929 
they could theoretically put an
expansion<00:01:42.390> slot<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.259> haven't<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.159> XL

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
expansion slot but they haven't so XL

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
expansion slot but they haven't so XL
ATX<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> means<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> has<00:01:46.320> eight<00:01:46.470> expansion

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
ATX so that means it has eight expansion

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
corresponds I'm going to move this board

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.479 
corresponds I'm going to move this board
don't<00:02:49.200> worry<00:02:49.379> about<00:02:49.500> moving<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.829> camera<00:02:50.099> that

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
don't worry about moving the camera that

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.399 
don't worry about moving the camera that
corresponds<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.480> top<00:02:51.750> left<00:02:51.989> mounting

corresponds to that top left mounting
screw<00:02:52.620> there<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.129> can<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.579> at<00:02:53.669> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
screw there so you can see it's at the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.539 
screw there so you can see it's at the
edge<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.359> a<00:02:54.720> standard<00:02:55.169> width<00:02:55.349> board<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.040> this

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
edge of a standard width board so this

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.289 
edge of a standard width board so this
EVGA<00:02:57.239> XL<00:02:58.019> ATX<00:02:58.500> board<00:02:58.799> decides<00:02:59.250> being<00:02:59.609> too<00:03:00.030> long

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
EVGA XL ATX board decides being too long

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.520 
EVGA XL ATX board decides being too long
is<00:03:00.659> actually<00:03:01.409> also<00:03:01.650> too<00:03:02.430> wide<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.329> that's<00:03:04.109> not

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
is actually also too wide but that's not

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.640 
is actually also too wide but that's not
going<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.980> stop<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.579> 1/2<00:03:05.790> X<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.109> think<00:03:07.469> we've

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
going to stop the 1/2 X so I think we've

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.349 
going to stop the 1/2 X so I think we've
actually<00:03:07.889> pretty<00:03:08.400> much<00:03:08.459> covered<00:03:09.000> everything

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
actually pretty much covered everything

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.809 
actually pretty much covered everything
I<00:03:09.569> wanted<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> say<00:03:10.139> about<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.590> XL<00:03:11.010> ATX<00:03:11.430> topic

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
I wanted to say about the XL ATX topic

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.789 
I wanted to say about the XL ATX topic

my full unboxing this is one beast of

my full unboxing this is one beast of
the<00:03:22.349> case<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.769> actually<00:03:23.129> has<00:03:23.280> 9<00:03:23.819> expansion

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the case it actually has 9 expansion

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
the case it actually has 9 expansion
slots<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.859> easily<00:03:26.220> support<00:03:26.819> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
slots so it can easily support the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.750 
slots so it can easily support the
gigabyte<00:03:27.299> board<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.199> can<00:03:28.379> just<00:03:28.859> just
