00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey guys today we're gonna be learning a

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys today we're gonna be learning a
sleight-of-hand<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:03.149> have<00:00:03.270> called<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.659> glide

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
sleight-of-hand we have called the glide

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.710 
sleight-of-hand we have called the glide
which<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.069> really<00:00:05.520> useful<00:00:05.640> move<00:00:06.060> especially

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
which is a really useful move especially

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660 
which is a really useful move especially
if<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.870> want<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.109> keep<00:00:07.589> control<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.220> card<00:00:08.460> on

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
if you want to keep control of a card on

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.990 
if you want to keep control of a card on
the<00:00:08.880> bottom<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.780> pack<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.490> for<00:00:11.490> example<00:00:11.849> if

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the bottom of the pack so for example if

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.789 
the bottom of the pack so for example if
we<00:00:12.120> want<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.300> keep<00:00:12.480> control<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.380> ace<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we want to keep control of the ace of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.129 
we want to keep control of the ace of
spades<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.900> we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
spades right here what we can do is we

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.340 
spades right here what we can do is we
can<00:00:16.260> apparently<00:00:16.590> deal<00:00:17.340> cards<00:00:17.699> off<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.960> bottom

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
can apparently deal cards off the bottom

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650 
can apparently deal cards off the bottom
of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> pack<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> put<00:00:20.730> keep<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> ace<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
of the pack and put keep the ace of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
of the pack and put keep the ace of
spades<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.260> our<00:00:22.650> control<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.880> that's<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
spades in our control so that's what the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:38.689 
spades in our control so that's what the
guard<00:00:24.570> looks<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.019> let's<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.590> into<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.040 

okay<00:00:39.699> so<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:40.030> guy<00:00:40.149> can<00:00:40.390> use<00:00:40.600> for<00:00:40.750> loads<00:00:40.899> of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
okay so the guy can use for loads of

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.259 
okay so the guy can use for loads of
different<00:00:41.199> things<00:00:41.620> you<00:00:41.890> can<00:00:42.039> use<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.370> as<00:00:43.210> a

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
different things you can use it as a

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.209 
different things you can use it as a
card<00:00:43.600> force<00:00:43.899> or<00:00:44.289> you<00:00:44.530> could<00:00:44.710> use<00:00:44.890> it<00:00:44.920> as

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
card force or you could use it as

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.639 
card force or you could use it as
something<00:00:46.030> like<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.420> card<00:00:46.719> any<00:00:46.930> number<00:00:47.290> routine

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
something like a card any number routine

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.430 
something like a card any number routine
so<00:00:48.489> it's<00:00:48.790> got<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.089> lot<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.269> uses<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.019> so<00:00:50.320> it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
so it's got a lot of uses to it so it's

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.040 
so it's got a lot of uses to it so it's
a<00:00:50.500> really<00:00:50.620> useful<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:51.399> know<00:00:51.550> how<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.760> do<00:00:52.059> so

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
a really useful to know how to do so

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.689 
a really useful to know how to do so
I'll<00:00:53.170> just<00:00:53.379> show<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:53.979> how<00:00:54.220> it's<00:00:54.370> done<00:00:54.430> before

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
I'll just show you how it's done before

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.250 
I'll just show you how it's done before
we<00:00:55.000> actually<00:00:55.089> get<00:00:55.329> into<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.690> handling<00:00:56.079> and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
we actually get into the handling and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.590 
we actually get into the handling and
stuff<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.790> what's<00:00:58.089> actually<00:00:58.239> going

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
stuff like that so what's actually going

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.780 
stuff like that so what's actually going
on<00:00:58.780> is<00:00:59.050> for<00:00:59.680> example<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.190> add<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.430> Queen<00:01:00.640> of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
on is for example if we add the Queen of

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.509 
on is for example if we add the Queen of
Hearts<00:01:00.969> here<00:01:01.329> what<00:01:02.110> happens<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.710> as<00:01:03.219> I

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
Hearts here what happens is as I

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.280 
Hearts here what happens is as I
apparently<00:01:03.940> deal<00:01:04.330> like<00:01:04.509> Queen<00:01:04.690> of<00:01:04.809> Hearts<00:01:04.960> off

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
apparently deal like Queen of Hearts off

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.109 
apparently deal like Queen of Hearts off
of<00:01:05.530> course<00:01:05.830> that's<00:01:06.040> an<00:01:06.280> indifferent<00:01:06.850> card

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
of course that's an indifferent card

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.380 
of course that's an indifferent card
okay<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.680> one<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.789> next<00:01:10.090> one<00:01:10.240> and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
okay and so is that one the next one and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.570 
okay and so is that one the next one and
I<00:01:10.479> can<00:01:10.630> just<00:01:10.780> keep<00:01:11.020> doing<00:01:11.050> this<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.369> alive

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
I can just keep doing this and the alive

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.820 
I can just keep doing this and the alive
cards<00:01:13.000> from<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> bottom<00:01:13.720> until<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.440> want<00:01:14.740> to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
cards from the bottom until I want to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.800 
cards from the bottom until I want to
deal<00:01:15.009> off<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:15.369> Queen<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.179> then<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.479> can<00:01:16.659> get

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
deal off that Queen and then I can get

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.060 
deal off that Queen and then I can get
the<00:01:16.899> Queen<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:18.070> what's<00:01:18.220> actually<00:01:18.369> going<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.970> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the Queen so what's actually going on is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.249 
the Queen so what's actually going on is
if<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.190> don't<00:01:21.250> form<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.610> exposed<00:01:21.940> view<00:01:22.179> as<00:01:22.929> I

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
if I don't form that exposed view as I

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.520 
if I don't form that exposed view as I
tilt<00:01:23.319> my<00:01:23.649> hand<00:01:23.950> down<00:01:24.159> I<00:01:24.630> simply<00:01:25.630> do<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.170> move

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
tilt my hand down I simply do that move

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.469 
tilt my hand down I simply do that move
right<00:01:26.710> there<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.580> it's<00:01:27.759> pretty<00:01:28.149> invisible

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
right there so it's pretty invisible

it<00:03:41.320> pokes<00:03:41.740> out<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.900> middle<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.110> ring

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it pokes out so you your middle and ring

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.920 
it pokes out so you your middle and ring
fingers<00:03:47.680> pull<00:03:47.980> backwards<00:03:48.490> on<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.850> King<00:03:49.060> just

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
fingers pull backwards on that King just

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.190 
fingers pull backwards on that King just
like<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.400> they<00:03:51.510> your<00:03:52.510> whole<00:03:52.690> hand<00:03:52.900> sort

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
like that and they your whole hand sort

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.720 
like that and they your whole hand sort
of<00:03:53.260> slides<00:03:53.500> backwards<00:03:53.800> pulling<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.460> kink

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
of slides backwards pulling that kink

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.120 
of slides backwards pulling that kink
and<00:03:55.470> because<00:03:56.470> you're<00:03:56.590> holding<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:56.950> in<00:03:57.040> this

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
and because you're holding it in this

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.360 
and because you're holding it in this
position<00:03:57.700> you're<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:59.290> back<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.650> your<00:03:59.740> palm<00:04:00.070> so

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
position you're the back of your palm so

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.300 
position you're the back of your palm so
the<00:04:00.730> back<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:00.970> your<00:04:01.060> hand<00:04:01.240> here<00:04:01.390> covers<00:04:02.380> that

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
the back of your hand here covers that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.700 
the back of your hand here covers that
exposed<00:04:03.880> King<00:04:04.360> if<00:04:04.990> you're<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.560> different

exposed King if you're in a different

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.410 
exposed King if you're in a different
position<00:04:05.980> like<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.610> if<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.000> hold<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.270> deck

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
position like this if you hold the deck

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.040 
position like this if you hold the deck
like<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
like that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.930 
like that
spectators<00:04:08.860> will<00:04:09.070> see<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.550> back<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.910> that

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
spectators will see the back of that

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.820 
spectators will see the back of that
card<00:04:10.330> book<00:04:10.660> because<00:04:11.500> you're<00:04:11.560> holding<00:04:11.800> that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
card book because you're holding that

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.300 
card book because you're holding that
deck<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.640> it's<00:04:13.630> pretty<00:04:14.590> it's<00:04:14.980> really

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
deck like this it's pretty it's really

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.740 
deck like this it's pretty it's really
angle<00:04:15.610> proof<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.000> only<00:04:16.030> angle<00:04:16.450> because<00:04:16.600> back

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
angle proof the only angle because back

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.720 
angle proof the only angle because back
totus<00:04:17.080> can<00:04:17.290> see<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:18.220> came<00:04:18.400> from

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
totus can see that came from

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.690 
totus can see that came from
is<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.090> angle<00:04:19.450> right<00:04:19.510> here<00:04:19.690> but<00:04:20.680> there<00:04:21.160> if

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
is this angle right here but there if

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.280 
is this angle right here but there if
you<00:04:21.910> disposition<00:04:22.480> it's<00:04:22.720> about<00:04:22.840> teachers<00:04:23.170> over

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
you disposition it's about teachers over

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.920 
you disposition it's about teachers over
here<00:04:23.620> instead<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.100> here<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.730> this<00:04:25.690> moves

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
here instead of here and this moves

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.130 
here instead of here and this moves
pretty<00:04:26.290> much<00:04:26.440> angle<00:04:26.680> proof<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.840> more<00:04:29.020> you

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
pretty much angle proof so the more you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.990 
pretty much angle proof so the more you
pull<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> King<00:04:29.650> down<00:04:29.830> obviously<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.610> easier

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
pull the King down obviously the easier

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520 
pull the King down obviously the easier
it's<00:04:31.150> going<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> be<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.720> pull<00:04:31.960> out<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.260> card

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
it's going to be to pull out the card

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.920 
it's going to be to pull out the card
above<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.010> okay<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.210> more<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.600> pull<00:04:34.900> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
above it okay but the more you pull the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.140 
above it okay but the more you pull the
King<00:04:35.230> back<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.100> harder<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.850> feel

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
King back the harder it's going to feel

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
King back the harder it's going to feel
too<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> harder<00:04:38.350> it's<00:04:38.470> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.620> be<00:04:38.800> for

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
too it's the harder it's going to be for

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.860 
too it's the harder it's going to be for
you<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.220> get<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.580> pin<00:04:39.850> back<00:04:39.880> into<00:04:40.450> position

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
you to get that pin back into position

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.320 
you to get that pin back into position
so<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.830> want<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.100> find<00:04:42.310> sort<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:43.060> middle

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
so you want to find sort of a middle

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.170 
so you want to find sort of a middle
ground<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:44.200> isn't<00:04:44.490> ridiculously<00:04:45.490> short<00:04:45.610> so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
ground that isn't ridiculously short so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.760 
ground that isn't ridiculously short so
you<00:04:46.390> obviously<00:04:47.080> want<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.290> pull<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.620> bit

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
you obviously want to pull it a bit

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.320 
you obviously want to pull it a bit
further<00:04:48.010> than<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.190> because<00:04:48.490> you're<00:04:49.240> gonna

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
further than that because you're gonna

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.960 
further than that because you're gonna
really<00:04:49.630> struggling<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.290> get<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.710> cards<00:04:51.160> out

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
really struggling to get the cards out

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.080 
really struggling to get the cards out
from<00:04:52.300> above<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.690> if<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:52.960> do<00:04:53.290> not<00:04:53.440> like<00:04:53.590> that

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
from above it if you do not like that

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.560 
from above it if you do not like that
but<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.960> pull<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.200> too<00:04:56.320> far<00:04:56.800> okay<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.300> let's

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
but if you pull it too far okay so let's

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.750 
but if you pull it too far okay so let's
say<00:04:58.720> if<00:04:58.840> we<00:04:58.930> pull<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.170> up<00:04:59.410> far<00:04:59.680> yeah<00:05:00.580> it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
say if we pull it up far yeah it's

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.280 
say if we pull it up far yeah it's
really<00:05:00.970> easy<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.300> get<00:05:01.450> cards<00:05:01.810> out<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.140> can

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
really easy to get cards out you can

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.650 
really easy to get cards out you can
deal<00:05:02.800> really<00:05:03.010> quickly<00:05:03.460> but<00:05:04.060> when<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.330> comes<00:05:04.510> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
deal really quickly but when it comes to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.940 
deal really quickly but when it comes to
getting

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
getting

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.640 
getting
came<00:05:05.160> back<00:05:05.430> I've<00:05:05.790> really<00:05:06.360> gotta<00:05:06.540> sort<00:05:06.840> of<00:05:06.930> move

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
came back I've really gotta sort of move

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
came back I've really gotta sort of move
my<00:05:07.890> hand<00:05:08.130> really<00:05:08.520> hard<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:09.810> get<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> King<00:05:10.290> back

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
my hand really hard to get the King back

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.690 
my hand really hard to get the King back
and<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.890> looks<00:05:11.070> suspicious

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
and it looks suspicious

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.990 
and it looks suspicious
so<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.010> best<00:05:14.160> way<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.370> have<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.670> is

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
so and the the best way to have it is

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.240 
so and the the best way to have it is
probably<00:05:15.330> about<00:05:15.650> probably<00:05:16.650> about<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:17.040> much

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
probably about probably about that much

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.430 
probably about probably about that much
room<00:05:17.430> like<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:17.730> so<00:05:18.540> you<00:05:18.660> can<00:05:18.930> easily<00:05:19.080> get

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
room like that so you can easily get

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.030 
room like that so you can easily get
cards<00:05:19.770> out<00:05:19.920> and<00:05:21.020> then<00:05:22.020> whenever<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.830> want<00:05:22.980> to

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
cards out and then whenever you want to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.010 
cards out and then whenever you want to
put<00:05:23.190> them<00:05:23.280> back<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:24.000> can<00:05:24.150> put<00:05:24.360> them<00:05:24.450> back<00:05:24.480> okay

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
put them back you can put them back okay

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.870 
put them back you can put them back okay
so<00:05:25.230> once<00:05:25.560> your<00:05:25.800> once<00:05:26.370> you've<00:05:26.520> pulled<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
so once your once you've pulled the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.990 
so once your once you've pulled the
