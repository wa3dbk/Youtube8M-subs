00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
with Motown it's been so present in my

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310 
with Motown it's been so present in my
upbringing<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.420> musical<00:00:51.420> background<00:00:51.989> but

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
upbringing and my musical background but

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
upbringing and my musical background but
I've<00:00:52.559> never<00:00:52.860> done<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.519> studio<00:00:53.910> recording<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I think that we kind of got that across

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.850 
I think that we kind of got that across
in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.030> recordings<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> kind<00:00:58.769> of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
in the recordings with all the kind of

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.700 
in the recordings with all the kind of
life<00:00:59.039> sounds<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.089> brass<00:01:00.360> section<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
life sounds the brass section and the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
life sounds the brass section and the
kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.190> hugeness<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
kind of hugeness of it and it kind of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
kind of hugeness of it and it kind of
came<00:01:04.470> together<00:01:04.649> really<00:01:04.830> quickly<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.700> got<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
