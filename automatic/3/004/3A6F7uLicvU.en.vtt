 Victor Bolivar Ledesma will give us a 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.980
 extended and detailed report on the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.240
 weather conditions and trajectory 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 of the tropical storm 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.830
 isaac bolívar what are the conditions 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.980
 of this phenomenon if we remember that since 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 the mayor yesterday what the depression 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.710
 tropical number 9 was developed as the 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.230
 tropical storm hoisted and already in hours of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.790
 the night hours of the morning we were 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.850
 making the coordinates of the place 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.150
 to establish that we are in this 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.870
 At the moment, the alert 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.970
 Hurricane conditions of Saona Island 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.370
 up flints and a warning of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.019
 tropical storm conditions from 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
 the island saona is the bay of 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.580
 manzanillo this is because still 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.890
 I was a little removed from what is the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.990
 tropical storm hoisted that in this 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.070
 moment it is about 340 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 miles east of guadeloupe and in that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 case let's start having the effect 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.330
 of this phenomenon already for tomorrow in the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.250
 night with the downpour activity and 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.500
 from tomorrow also the swell 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 with inside salad when you get to what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.490
 along the coast of the republic 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 Dominican so it is quite possible that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.780
 in the course of today there was a 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.400
 early morning tomorrow 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.170
 we are issuing that all the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.900
 boats must remain in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.060
 port we released to the population that 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.710
 They live in high - risk areas for 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.900
 begin to take the measure of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.090
 preparation to move to the place of 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.190
 sure since values ​​are expected 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.260
 accumulated rainfall that can 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 reach up to 200 millimeters above 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.330
 our territory with the passage of the 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.760
 tropical storm and that if fried 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.280
 we are handling an alert newsletter 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.010
 of hurricane conditions this is due 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.780
 that all trajectory models 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.210
 they indicate that already for tomorrow in hour of the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.360
 late when it is south 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.460
 already from what san juan puerto rico 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 then it developed a little more and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.260
 it becomes a hurricane 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.900
 important in this is no longer that you 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.670
 turn a new hurricane the alerts 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.160
 they indicate that we are going to have at least 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.500
 one or two of the effects associated with a 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.800
 tropical cyclone as are the winds 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 strong as are the heavy rain and how 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.080
 are the breaking waves along the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 Coast of the Dominican Republic 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 regardless of whether it develops 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.620
 clearer as you develop a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.350
 little more if it becomes a hurricane with 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 the winds would be superior as well 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.180
 that the waves were three days higher 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.950
 and in that case we would be emitting 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.770
 bulletins and flood warning 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.600
 sudden bulletins against waves 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.510
 abnormal along the entire coast 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.430
 of the country and we are already on alert from the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.130
 first thing in the early morning of the day of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.020
 today he spoke of high levels of rain 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.240
 this means that it could be 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.880
 It raining since Thursday morning until 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.250
 tell us if we are calculating that already for 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.280
 tomorrow or 9 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.860
 24 to 36 hours we would be starting to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.260
 have activity of downpour product of 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.330
 what is the tropical storm hoisted to 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.400
 as the cloudy field associated with 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.950
 she begins to penetrate the area of 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.750
 Caribbean these rains could spread 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.910
 until the day on Saturday and why not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.370
 until Sunday after a 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.380
 phenomenon of this nature goes through the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.510
 Dominican territory instability 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.670
 it stays pretty over the territory 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.350
 and here we both have pit prices 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.900
 actions we will have to be in 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.600
 warning and in warning against floods and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.610
 not sudden but progressive in large 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.760
 part of the country in all areas of 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.290
 high flood watering good and 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.940
 only the population remains 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.800
 Attentive to the bulletins of the office 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.200
 national meteorology that will be 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.630
 giving all the details of the path of 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.610
 the tropical storm and that's all 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.030
 from my side I return with you to the center
