00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.190 

we<00:00:17.800> probably<00:00:18.189> affected<00:00:18.700> a<00:00:18.759> little<00:00:18.970> bit<00:00:19.140> by<00:00:20.140> the

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
we probably affected a little bit by the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.880 
we probably affected a little bit by the
moment<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.800> stage<00:00:21.899> we<00:00:22.899> played<00:00:23.169> hard<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.649> we

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
moment the stage we played hard and we

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.400 
moment the stage we played hard and we
worked<00:00:23.919> hard<00:00:24.460> we<00:00:24.700> just<00:00:24.939> didn't<00:00:25.270> I<00:00:25.540> didn't

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
worked hard we just didn't I didn't

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.940 
worked hard we just didn't I didn't
think<00:00:26.500> we<00:00:26.649> played<00:00:26.680> with<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.320> same<00:00:29.590> edge

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
think we played with the the same edge

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.170 
think we played with the the same edge
the<00:00:30.369> same<00:00:30.550> belief<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:32.320> we<00:00:32.439> normally<00:00:32.800> do<00:00:33.180> then

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
the same belief that we normally do then

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.660 
the same belief that we normally do then
we<00:00:34.270> put<00:00:34.450> a<00:00:34.510> few<00:00:34.750> shifts<00:00:35.110> together<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.770> sort<00:00:36.580> of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
we put a few shifts together and sort of

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.090 
we put a few shifts together and sort of
stabilize<00:00:37.150> things<00:00:37.510> at<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.840> end<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.110> pair

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.470 

what's<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.329> important<00:00:47.780> for<00:00:47.899> us<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.019> pressure

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
what's so important for us is pressure

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.630 
what's so important for us is pressure
we<00:00:50.480> skate<00:00:50.809> we<00:00:51.769> get<00:00:51.949> pressure<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:52.339> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
we skate we get pressure on the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.450 
we skate we get pressure on the
forecheck<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.570> try<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.469> get<00:00:54.649> two<00:00:54.769> pucks<00:00:54.980> first

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
forecheck and try to get two pucks first

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.490 
forecheck and try to get two pucks first
and<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:57.350> started<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.739> play<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.070> body<00:00:59.109> which<00:01:00.109> I

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
and we started to play the body which I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.590 
and we started to play the body which I
think<00:01:01.129> helped<00:01:01.370> us<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.640> lot

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
think helped us a lot

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.560 
think helped us a lot
and<00:01:03.930> once<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.619> start<00:01:05.070> doing<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and once we start doing the things we do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.770 
and once we start doing the things we do
well<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.280> energizes<00:01:09.090> everybody<00:01:09.509> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
well it really energizes everybody and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
well it really energizes everybody and
we<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.409> got<00:01:10.560> energized<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.310> second

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
we really got energized in that second

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
we really got energized in that second
period<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.420> funding<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
period it was it was funding that you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
period it was it was funding that you
know<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.619> point<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.340> much<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
know at this point so much of it is I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.960 
know at this point so much of it is I
just<00:01:18.270> stand<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> stay<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
just stand back and stay on the way and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
just stand back and stay on the way and
they've<00:01:20.970> they've<00:01:21.600> done<00:01:21.780> such<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.200> job<00:01:22.259> all

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
they've they've done such a good job all

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.899 
they've they've done such a good job all
year<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.430> consistently<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:26.340> sometimes

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
year and so consistently that sometimes

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.990 
year and so consistently that sometimes
now<00:01:27.210> lately<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.899> been<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.470> sort<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> wait

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
now lately it's been just sort of wait

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.620 
now lately it's been just sort of wait
for<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.110> kick<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.009> gear<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
for them to kick it into gear and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
for them to kick it into gear and
luckily<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.990> far<00:01:34.259> we've<00:01:34.500> found<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> point<00:01:35.729> at

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
luckily so far we've found that point at

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.029 
luckily so far we've found that point at
some<00:01:36.000> point<00:01:36.210> during<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> game<00:01:42.590> larose<00:01:43.590> played

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
some point during the game larose played

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.050 
some point during the game larose played
played<00:01:44.970> his<00:01:45.179> normal<00:01:45.630> terrific<00:01:46.440> game<00:01:47.060> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
played his normal terrific game and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.419 
played his normal terrific game and
defensively<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.110> did<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.319> good<00:01:49.530> job<00:01:49.590> keeping

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
defensively we did a good job keeping

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.059 
defensively we did a good job keeping
them<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> perimeter<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:52.200> blocked<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.830> lot

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
when we start doing that we can be a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.880 
when we start doing that we can be a
pretty<00:02:12.989> good<00:02:13.140> team

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.720 

these<00:02:21.890> guys<00:02:22.190> from<00:02:22.610> last<00:02:23.000> spring<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:24.730> with

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
these guys from last spring on with

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.360 
these guys from last spring on with
workouts<00:02:26.330> they've<00:02:27.050> really<00:02:27.370> committed

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
workouts they've really committed

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.520

themselves

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
themselves

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.059 

and<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.430> don't<00:02:31.730> think<00:02:32.000> I've<00:02:32.120> had<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.270> team<00:02:32.569> that

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
and I don't think I've had a team that

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.610 
and I don't think I've had a team that
works<00:02:34.090> consistently<00:02:35.090> hard<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.440> one

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
works consistently hard like this one

works consistently hard like this one
buzz<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:40.010> know<00:02:40.130> they<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.819> deserve<00:02:41.209> it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
buzz and you know they they deserve it
