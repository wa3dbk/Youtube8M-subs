a<00:05:08.350> separate<00:05:08.950> video<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.550> think<00:05:10.180> there's<00:05:10.330> about

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
a separate video I think there's about

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.300 
a separate video I think there's about
four<00:05:10.810> or<00:05:10.840> five<00:05:10.990> days<00:05:11.200> ago<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.830> want<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.250> do

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
four or five days ago so you want to do

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.040 
four or five days ago so you want to do
that<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.729> final<00:05:13.090> thing<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.450> going<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:13.960> be

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
that the final thing is going to be

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.530 
that the final thing is going to be
fruit<00:05:14.350> draft<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.979> my<00:05:15.250> opinions<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:15.970> really

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
fruit draft and my opinions and I really

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.570
