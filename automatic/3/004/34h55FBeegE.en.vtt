00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.980
 hey, I'm even your mate me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 Of course I try again today 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 on our examiner skills challenge 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.860
 prepare 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 Today it is in the part of magister 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.689
 the ball control and the perfect pass 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
 I also have an exercise for you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.760
 you can and you can put together 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529
 Of course like to imitate 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.000
 I wish you a lot of fun here 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.000
 succeed and do well 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 This exercise is relatively easy to explain 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.090
 wants to come 45 balls leaked trying 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 this as soon as possible under control 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.270
 to bring them around then 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.270
 hat to play tour 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.940
 Here you have to go as fast as possible 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.440
 decide with which body part he 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.750
 might bring the ball under control 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 pay attention not so much on the body 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.300
 can be free immediately 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.300
 continue to play 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.520
 so does the magister exercises 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 now over 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.720
 Here you can also get a maximum of 20 points 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 to reach 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.740
 Apply for our preview skills 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.540
 challenge with sacks are better than 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.260
 everyone else just shows us what he does 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.260
 has on it 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.700

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.860
