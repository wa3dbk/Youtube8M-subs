condenser microphone and briefly go over
how<00:00:50.050> they<00:00:50.200> work

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
how they work

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.270 
how they work
this<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.630> dynamic<00:00:52.870> microphone<00:00:53.320> some

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
this is a dynamic microphone some

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.770 
this is a dynamic microphone some
benefits<00:00:54.670> using<00:00:55.060> this<00:00:55.150> kind<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.450> microphone

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
benefits using this kind of microphone

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.960 
benefits using this kind of microphone
is<00:00:56.170> its<00:00:56.680> resistance<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:57.250> moisture<00:00:57.460> and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
is its resistance to moisture and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.210 
is its resistance to moisture and
substance<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.480> abuse<00:00:58.780> dynamic<00:00:59.710> microphones

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
substance to abuse dynamic microphones

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.920 
substance to abuse dynamic microphones
are<00:01:00.430> used<00:01:00.580> on<00:01:00.730> louder<00:01:00.940> instruments<00:01:01.720> because

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
are used on louder instruments because

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.240 
are used on louder instruments because
they<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:02.260> handle<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.620> lot<00:01:02.680> more<00:01:03.070> than<00:01:03.220> a

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
they can handle a lot more than a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.070 
they can handle a lot more than a
condenser<00:01:03.730> can<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.510> why<00:01:04.660> you<00:01:04.720> see<00:01:04.809> them

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
condenser can this is why you see them

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.890 
condenser can this is why you see them
at<00:01:05.199> live<00:01:05.379> shows<00:01:05.680> or<00:01:05.920> on<00:01:06.040> loud<00:01:06.220> instruments<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
at live shows or on loud instruments an

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.630 
at live shows or on loud instruments an
example<00:01:08.410> of<00:01:08.620> an<00:01:08.800> instrument<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.460> might

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
example of an instrument that this might

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
example of an instrument that this might
be<00:01:09.790> placed<00:01:10.030> on<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.570> in<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.869> kick<00:01:11.110> drum<00:01:11.410> on<00:01:11.619> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
be placed on is in a kick drum on a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.910 
be placed on is in a kick drum on a
guitar<00:01:12.729> amp<00:01:13.000> or<00:01:13.240> really<00:01:13.690> loud<00:01:13.869> vocals<00:01:14.380> good

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
guitar amp or really loud vocals good

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.260 
guitar amp or really loud vocals good
thing<00:01:15.100> about<00:01:15.190> these<00:01:15.430> microphones<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.150> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
thing about these microphones is it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.940 
thing about these microphones is it
doesn't<00:01:16.450> require<00:01:16.780> batteries<00:01:17.110> or<00:01:17.500> external

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
doesn't require batteries or external

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.980 
doesn't require batteries or external
power<00:01:19.229> dynamic<00:01:20.229> microphones<00:01:20.740> have<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:22.000> magnet

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
power dynamic microphones have a magnet

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.050 
power dynamic microphones have a magnet
inside<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.530> them<00:01:23.649> which<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.130> attached<00:01:24.790> to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
inside of them which is attached to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.630 
inside of them which is attached to
finally<00:01:25.750> wrapped<00:01:25.990> coils<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.470> wire<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
finally wrapped coils of wire these

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.780 
finally wrapped coils of wire these
wires<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:29.140> displaced<00:01:29.649> every<00:01:29.979> time<00:01:30.220> sound

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
wires get displaced every time sound

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.730 
wires get displaced every time sound
hits<00:01:31.030> them<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.450> they<00:01:31.570> move<00:01:31.899> up<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.500> down

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
hits them so they move up and down

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.420 
hits them so they move up and down
depending<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:34.090> how<00:01:34.360> loud<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:36.070> sound<00:01:36.310> is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
depending on how loud the sound is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.219 
depending on how loud the sound is
entering<00:01:36.729> when<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.390> coils<00:01:37.720> are<00:01:37.840> moving<00:01:38.080> up

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
entering when the coils are moving up

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.499 
entering when the coils are moving up
and<00:01:38.410> down<00:01:38.619> they<00:01:39.250> cut<00:01:39.490> through<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.880> rings<00:01:40.149> of

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
and down they cut through the rings of

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.570 
and down they cut through the rings of
magnetic<00:01:41.020> flux<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.800> magnet<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.280> giving

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
magnetic flux that the magnet is giving

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580 
magnetic flux that the magnet is giving
off<00:01:42.759> now<00:01:43.060> magnetic<00:01:43.570> flux<00:01:43.840> looking<00:01:44.350> something

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
off now magnetic flux looking something

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.070 
off now magnetic flux looking something
sort<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.070> like<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.390> magnet<00:01:46.840> is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
sort of like this so the magnet is

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.160 
sort of like this so the magnet is
giving<00:01:47.920> off<00:01:48.690> rings<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.800> coil<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:53.020> up

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
giving off rings and the coil going up

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.260 
giving off rings and the coil going up
and<00:01:53.350> down<00:01:53.470> cuts<00:01:54.100> through<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.729> creates<00:01:55.149> an

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
and down cuts through it and creates an

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.950 
and down cuts through it and creates an
output<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.710> sound<00:01:56.979> as<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:58.119> speak<00:01:58.420> enters

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
output so sound as I speak enters

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.310 
output so sound as I speak enters
through<00:01:59.200> here<00:01:59.470> moves<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.460> coils<00:02:01.200> creates<00:02:02.200> an

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
through here moves the coils creates an

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.530 
through here moves the coils creates an
output

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780 

now<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.650> an<00:02:05.800> example<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.340> condenser

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
now this is an example of a condenser

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.580 
now this is an example of a condenser
microphone<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.510> chakra<00:02:07.780> condenser

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
microphone in a chakra condenser

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.350 
microphone in a chakra condenser
microphones<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.310> require<00:02:09.760> external<00:02:10.180> power

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
microphones do require external power

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360 
microphones do require external power
but<00:02:11.050> they<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.170> very<00:02:11.530> quick<00:02:11.800> response<00:02:11.980> to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
but they have very quick response to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
but they have very quick response to
sound<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:13.210> thing<00:02:13.390> about<00:02:13.600> condensers<00:02:14.470> is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
sound one thing about condensers is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.230 
sound one thing about condensers is
they're<00:02:14.800> super<00:02:15.220> sensitive<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.820> they<00:02:15.940> pick<00:02:16.090> up

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
they're super sensitive so they pick up

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.810 
they're super sensitive so they pick up
everything<00:02:16.390> coughing<00:02:17.350> sneezing<00:02:18.160> snapping

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
everything coughing sneezing snapping

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.620 
everything coughing sneezing snapping
they<00:02:19.810> are<00:02:20.170> used<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.040> pick<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.490> room<00:02:22.210> sounds

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
they are used to pick up room sounds

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.210 
they are used to pick up room sounds
because<00:02:22.960> they're<00:02:23.200> super<00:02:23.350> sensitive<00:02:23.830> nature

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
because they're super sensitive nature

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
because they're super sensitive nature
since<00:02:24.610> they're<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:24.970> sensitive<00:02:25.180> they're<00:02:25.630> not

inside of it one plate is fixed and one

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.850 
inside of it one plate is fixed and one
is<00:02:35.740> movable<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.000> sound<00:02:37.270> as<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.690> enters<00:02:38.050> makes

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
is movable so sound as it enters makes

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.280 
is movable so sound as it enters makes
them<00:02:39.100> vibrate<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.440> they<00:02:41.440> send<00:02:42.130> sound<00:02:43.290> down

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
them vibrate and they send sound down

them vibrate and they send sound down
through<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.680> battery<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:45.610> create<00:02:46.480> an

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
through a battery and then create an

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.450 
through a battery and then create an
output<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.470> reason<00:02:47.770> condensers<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.430> a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
output the reason condensers have a

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.130 
output the reason condensers have a
little<00:02:48.730> amplifier<00:02:49.060> inside<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.840> them<00:02:49.960> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
little amplifier inside of them is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.500 
little amplifier inside of them is
because<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:51.190> microphones<00:02:51.640> are<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.000> sensitive

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
because the microphones are so sensitive

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.470 
because the microphones are so sensitive
that<00:02:52.540> they<00:02:52.630> moves<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.170> it's<00:02:53.260> led<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.620> slight

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
that they moves and it's led to a slight

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.780 
that they moves and it's led to a slight
amount<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.560> output<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.250> would<00:02:57.400> create

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
amount that the output it would create

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.750 
amount that the output it would create
is<00:02:58.030> too<00:02:58.870> little<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.260> work<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.500> this<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.640> why

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
is too little to work with this is why

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.430 
is too little to work with this is why
you<00:03:00.820> need<00:03:01.090> external<00:03:01.360> power<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:02.020> run<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> mini

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
you need external power to run the mini

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.690 
you need external power to run the mini

unit for fire plates move through as
they<00:03:07.060> shift<00:03:07.350> battery<00:03:08.350> output<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.900> as<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.140> speak

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
they shift battery output so as I speak

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.920 
they shift battery output so as I speak
