perspective because the the hull and the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.380 
perspective because the the hull and the
inside<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.129> boat<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.459> connected<00:03:43.970> by<00:03:44.090> foam

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
inside of the boat is connected by foam

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.210 
inside of the boat is connected by foam
it<00:03:44.599> creates<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.930> very<00:03:45.170> solid<00:03:45.620> structure<00:03:46.069> which

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
it creates a very solid structure which

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.710 
it creates a very solid structure which
you<00:03:46.250> feel<00:03:46.640> when<00:03:46.849> you're<00:03:46.970> running<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.329> boat<00:03:47.480> it

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
you feel when you're running the boat it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.170 
you feel when you're running the boat it
also<00:03:48.500> dampens<00:03:48.769> sound<00:03:49.250> because<00:03:49.700> we<00:03:49.940> don't<00:03:50.120> have

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
also dampens sound because we don't have

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.599 
also dampens sound because we don't have
hollow<00:03:50.569> cavities<00:03:51.200> within<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.709> hull<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.430> act

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
hollow cavities within the hull to act

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.580 
hollow cavities within the hull to act
like<00:03:52.819> a<00:03:52.849> drum<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.239> transfer<00:03:53.810> sound<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.530> is

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
like a drum and transfer sound this is

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.379 
like a drum and transfer sound this is
one<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.010> larger<00:03:55.400> deck<00:03:55.609> hatches<00:03:55.790> I've<00:03:56.150> seen

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
one of the larger deck hatches I've seen

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.750 
one of the larger deck hatches I've seen
yeah<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.040> we<00:03:58.129> did<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.489> for<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> reason

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
yeah it is and we did that for a reason

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.390 
yeah it is and we did that for a reason
we<00:03:59.359> want<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.720> provide<00:04:00.170> easy<00:04:00.590> access<00:04:01.129> for

maintenance serviceability so you can
get<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.709> all<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.950> pumps<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.400> components<00:04:05.000> very

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
get to all the pumps and components very

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.259 
get to all the pumps and components very
easily<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:06.709> also<00:04:07.129> keeps<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.519> lot<00:04:07.639> of<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.790> noisy

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269

the location our thick hatch and
insulation<00:04:15.049> from<00:04:15.200> yoona<00:04:15.530> bond<00:04:15.680> create<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.549> very

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
insulation from yoona bond create a very
