here<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.329> reviewing<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.719> iPhone<00:00:49.230> app

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
here and I'm reviewing an iPhone app

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250 
here and I'm reviewing an iPhone app
called<00:00:49.770> 8-millimeter<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> video

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
called 8-millimeter which is a video

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
called 8-millimeter which is a video
recording<00:00:52.440> app<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> iPhone<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
recording app for the iPhone that is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.290 
recording app for the iPhone that is
meant<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> emulate<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> bunch<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.530> old<00:00:56.300> movie

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
meant to emulate a bunch of old movie

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200 
meant to emulate a bunch of old movie
recording<00:00:57.480> devices<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> problem<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
recording devices and the problem I have

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.580 
recording devices and the problem I have
with<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> nostalgia<00:01:01.500> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
with this it's not the nostalgia it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
with this it's not the nostalgia it's
not<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> look<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.699> anything

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
not the look of them it's not anything

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.810 
not the look of them it's not anything
like<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.379> they<00:01:04.379> take<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.460> footage

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like that's they take a bit of footage

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.890 
like that's they take a bit of footage
and<00:01:06.350> deliberately<00:01:07.350> degrade<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.720> what's<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and deliberately degrade it what's the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
and deliberately degrade it what's the
point<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> having<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.560> awesomely<00:01:11.100> good<00:01:11.340> camera

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
point of having an awesomely good camera

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.370 
point of having an awesomely good camera
like<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> iPhone<00:01:12.479> 4<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.960> recording

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
like the iPhone 4 which I'm recording

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.649 
like the iPhone 4 which I'm recording
this<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.650> by<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> way<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.330> brilliant

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this on by the way it's a brilliant

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.429 
this on by the way it's a brilliant
camera<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> hell<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> then

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
camera I use up a hell of a lot but then

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
camera I use up a hell of a lot but then
you<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.549> camera<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.939> capable<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you take what this camera is capable of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
you take what this camera is capable of
and<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.110> smack<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.770> smack<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and you just smack it and smack it and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.929 
and you just smack it and smack it and
smack<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.450> hairy<00:01:24.869> bitch<00:01:25.350> until

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
smack it like a little hairy bitch until

what<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> spits<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.710> churned

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
what it spits out is this just churned

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
what it spits out is this just churned
up<00:01:29.250> mess<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.720> 8

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
up mess and that's what this 8

fills<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:04.920> grain<00:02:05.130> there's<00:02:05.310> another<00:02:05.460> one

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
fills it with grain there's another one

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.449 
fills it with grain there's another one
that<00:02:05.820> Dee<00:02:06.390> focuses<00:02:06.960> everything<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> looks

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that Dee focuses everything so it looks

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.150 
actual button you can stab at it as much
as<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> button<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.950> have

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
to actually swipe it sideways to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.570 
to actually swipe it sideways to
actually<00:02:55.740> change<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> thing<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.490> only

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580

works<00:02:56.790> half<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.240> friggin<00:02:57.660> time<00:02:57.870> anyway

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
works half the friggin time anyway

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.930 
works half the friggin time anyway
because<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> interface<00:02:59.160> design<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.640> so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
because the interface design is so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.910 
because the interface design is so
shitty<00:03:00.330> same<00:03:01.140> thing<00:03:01.350> up<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> top<00:03:01.740> there<00:03:01.890> you
