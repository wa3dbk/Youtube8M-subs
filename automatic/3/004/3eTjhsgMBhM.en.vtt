this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.779> my<00:00:30.929> other<00:00:31.050> basis<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> actually<00:00:32.219> based

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this is my other basis is actually based

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
this is my other basis is actually based
that<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.719> attacking<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> there's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that I'm not attacking on so there's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.810 
that I'm not attacking on so there's
that<00:00:37.920> when<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.250> one's<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.550> getting

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that when that one's actually getting

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.780 
that when that one's actually getting
pretty<00:00:38.940> far<00:00:39.239> along<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.690> too<00:00:40.489> because<00:00:41.489> mice

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
pretty far along now too because mice

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
pretty far along now too because mice

the last one I did online was nine days
which<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.519> think<00:04:05.760> was<00:04:05.879> one<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> last<00:04:06.269> video<00:04:06.599> was

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
which I think was one the last video was

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.439 
which I think was one the last video was
uploaded<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:08.579> been<00:04:08.729> a<00:04:08.760> while<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.030> for

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
uploaded so it's been a while it's for

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.420 
uploaded so it's been a while it's for
sure<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.470> basically<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:10.859> been<00:04:11.159> trying<00:04:11.310> to

donate<00:04:11.790> troops<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.419> I<00:04:12.479> don't<00:04:12.659> even<00:04:12.810> think<00:04:12.959> I

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
donate troops and I don't even think I

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.469 
donate troops and I don't even think I
had<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:13.530> when<00:04:13.620> he<00:04:13.739> don't<00:04:13.949> need<00:04:14.069> as<00:04:14.250> we'll<00:04:14.489> see

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
had that when he don't need as we'll see

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.180 
had that when he don't need as we'll see
here

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
here

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
bunch of resource and upgrade something

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.410 
bunch of resource and upgrade something
because<00:04:58.670> nothing's<00:04:59.670> been<00:04:59.850> upgrading<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
because nothing's been upgrading and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.750 
because nothing's been upgrading and
actually<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.780> think<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:02.340> other<00:05:02.490> thing<00:05:02.550> I'll

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
actually I think the other thing I'll

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.070 
actually I think the other thing I'll
probably<00:05:02.880> just<00:05:03.030> do<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.390> buy<00:05:03.510> another<00:05:03.750> shield

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
probably just do is buy another shield

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.990 
probably just do is buy another shield
as<00:05:04.290> well<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.680> think<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:05.280> cool<00:05:05.490> down<00:05:05.700> for<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
as well I think my cool down for the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.900

so probably just buy another shield in a
few<00:05:10.710> days<00:05:10.860> well<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.490> can<00:05:11.640> just<00:05:11.760> start

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
few days well so I can just start

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.910

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
yeah I'm trying to step on up here def

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.290 
yeah I'm trying to step on up here def
drones<00:05:41.370> I'll<00:05:41.580> probably<00:05:41.700> up<00:05:41.910> credit<00:05:42.180> app

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
drones I'll probably up credit app

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.610 
drones I'll probably up credit app
drones<00:05:42.570> actually<00:05:42.930> because<00:05:43.110> those<00:05:43.290> ones<00:05:43.500> are

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
drones actually because those ones are

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.710 
drones actually because those ones are
pretty<00:05:43.740> low<00:05:43.950> levels<00:05:44.280> right<00:05:44.430> now<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:45.360> I'm

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
pretty low levels right now and I'm

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.120 
pretty low levels right now and I'm
probably<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.140> good<00:05:46.350> idea<00:05:46.470> because<00:05:46.740> my<00:05:46.919> front

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
probably a good idea because my front

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.770 
probably a good idea because my front
doors<00:05:47.310> are<00:05:47.460> all<00:05:47.580> over<00:05:47.760> 5<00:05:48.060> or<00:05:48.390> mean<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:48.600> one's

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
doors are all over 5 or mean this one's

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.150 
doors are all over 5 or mean this one's
at<00:05:48.900> five<00:05:49.080> but<00:05:49.230> these<00:05:49.350> ones<00:05:49.530> are<00:05:49.620> six<00:05:49.890> silly

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
at five but these ones are six silly

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.130 
at five but these ones are six silly
we're<00:05:50.760> pretty<00:05:50.940> good<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.360> mean<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:51.750> cannot<00:05:51.930> bring

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
we're pretty good I mean I cannot bring

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.320 
we're pretty good I mean I cannot bring
them<00:05:52.290> any<00:05:52.380> further<00:05:52.620> anyways<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:54.210> i'll

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
them any further anyways so i'll

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.650 
them any further anyways so i'll
probably<00:05:54.510> upgrade<00:05:54.840> those<00:05:55.910> def<00:05:56.910> drones<00:05:57.270> a

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
probably upgrade those def drones a

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.090 
probably upgrade those def drones a
little<00:05:58.020> farther<00:05:58.200> so<00:05:58.530> i<00:05:58.560> can<00:05:58.740> do<00:05:58.860> some<00:05:59.010> more

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
little farther so i can do some more

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.360 
little farther so i can do some more
damage<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.640> then<00:06:00.770> after<00:06:01.770> i<00:06:01.800> get<00:06:01.980> those<00:06:02.160> i'll

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
damage and then after i get those i'll

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.740 
damage and then after i get those i'll
probably<00:06:02.550> try<00:06:02.730> to<00:06:02.820> start<00:06:03.090> upgrading<00:06:03.240> walls

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
probably try to start upgrading walls

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.020 
probably try to start upgrading walls
pads<00:06:04.110> level<00:06:04.410> 5<00:06:04.650> try<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.160> get<00:06:05.310> more<00:06:05.460> level<00:06:05.760> six

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
pads level 5 try to get more level six

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.140 
pads level 5 try to get more level six
at<00:06:06.150> least<00:06:06.770> um<00:06:07.770> but<00:06:08.190> I've<00:06:08.430> been<00:06:08.610> really<00:06:08.820> paying

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
at least um but I've been really paying

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.000 
at least um but I've been really paying
attention<00:06:09.210> more<00:06:09.750> to<00:06:09.780> my<00:06:10.110> other<00:06:10.290> base<00:06:10.560> because

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
attention more to my other base because

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.620 
attention more to my other base because
if<00:06:11.130> you<00:06:11.190> look<00:06:11.340> at<00:06:11.490> most<00:06:11.760> most<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.390> that<00:06:12.450> stuff

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
if you look at most most of that stuff

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.270 
if you look at most most of that stuff
is<00:06:13.580> upgraded<00:06:14.630> all<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.750> way<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:15.990> I'm<00:06:16.050> actually

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
is upgraded all the way and I'm actually

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.740 
is upgraded all the way and I'm actually
catching<00:06:17.280> up<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.610> space<00:06:17.790> very<00:06:18.180> very<00:06:18.480> fast

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
catching up to the space very very fast

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.110 
catching up to the space very very fast
so<00:06:19.200> I've<00:06:19.950> been<00:06:20.070> kind<00:06:20.310> of<00:06:20.400> pay<00:06:20.580> attention<00:06:20.610> that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
so I've been kind of pay attention that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.280 
so I've been kind of pay attention that
one<00:06:21.240> more<00:06:21.419> because<00:06:21.690> I'm<00:06:21.780> getting<00:06:22.020> kind<00:06:22.230> of

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
one more because I'm getting kind of

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.540 
one more because I'm getting kind of
farther<00:06:22.560> along<00:06:22.710> you've<00:06:23.040> no<00:06:23.160> it's<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.340> tunnel

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
farther along you've no it's a tunnel

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.920 
farther along you've no it's a tunnel
seven<00:06:23.970> but<00:06:24.090> I'm<00:06:24.180> getting<00:06:24.419> farther<00:06:24.630> along<00:06:24.780> in

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
seven but I'm getting farther along in

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.410 
seven but I'm getting farther along in
that<00:06:25.140> one

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
that one

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.410 
that one
here<00:06:25.780> already<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:26.770> then<00:06:27.580> I<00:06:27.610> have<00:06:27.940> most<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.330> my

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
here already and then I have most of my

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.360 
here already and then I have most of my
troops<00:06:28.660> on<00:06:28.840> that<00:06:28.990> one<00:06:29.110> upgrade<00:06:29.290> as<00:06:29.530> well<00:06:29.740> that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
troops on that one upgrade as well that

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.400 
troops on that one upgrade as well that
I<00:06:30.400> think<00:06:30.640> 20<00:06:30.790> gotta<00:06:31.090> upgrade<00:06:31.300> one<00:06:32.170> of<00:06:32.290> these

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
I think 20 gotta upgrade one of these

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.870 
I think 20 gotta upgrade one of these
guys<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.800> probably<00:06:32.980> upgrade<00:06:33.340> actually<00:06:33.760> the

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
wall barmer I'll probably upgrade that
