we<00:00:02.909> are<00:00:03.090> setting<00:00:03.510> up<00:00:03.600> an<00:00:03.780> oceanic<00:00:03.929> biocube<00:00:04.470> for

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
we are setting up an oceanic biocube for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.530 
we are setting up an oceanic biocube for
saltwater<00:00:05.870> we<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.230> added<00:00:07.910> rinsed<00:00:08.910> live<00:00:09.120> sand

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
saltwater we have added rinsed live sand

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.759 
saltwater we have added rinsed live sand
live<00:00:09.900> rock<00:00:10.290> we've<00:00:11.219> added<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.880> cleanup<00:00:12.480> crew

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
live rock we've added a cleanup crew

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
live rock we've added a cleanup crew
slowly<00:00:13.769> over<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.639> they're<00:00:15.599> cleaning

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
slowly over time and they're cleaning

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.620 
slowly over time and they're cleaning
the<00:00:16.020> algae<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.710> detritus<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.670> then<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.420> add

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the algae and detritus and then we add

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.790 
the algae and detritus and then we add
corals<00:00:20.810> finally<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.960> started<00:00:22.350> adding<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
corals finally we started adding the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
corals finally we started adding the
fish<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> add<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.240> over<00:00:24.390> time

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
fish which you want to add up over time

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
fish which you want to add up over time
as<00:00:24.930> well<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.000> bio<00:00:27.000> load<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
as well because as the bio load of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
as well because as the bio load of the
tank<00:00:27.869> increases<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.220> want<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> tank<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.119> grow

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
tank increases you want the tank to grow

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780 
tank increases you want the tank to grow
the<00:00:30.570> bacteria<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.380> helps<00:00:31.830> break<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the bacteria that helps break down the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.229 
the bacteria that helps break down the
nitrogen<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:34.260> fish<00:00:34.620> wastes<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.730> system

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
nitrogen our fish wastes in the system

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
nitrogen our fish wastes in the system
so<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.450> we<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.340> two<00:00:41.340> more

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so as you can see we now have two more

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.440 
so as you can see we now have two more
clownfish<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.520> we're<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> tanks

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
clownfish at it and we're at the tanks

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
clownfish at it and we're at the tanks
capacity<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.469> say<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.739> adding

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
capacity i would say for adding

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.209 
capacity i would say for adding
creatures<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.739> small

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
creatures because it is a very small

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.049 
creatures because it is a very small
tank<00:00:50.670> 20<00:00:51.300> 29<00:00:51.660> gallons<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> notice<00:00:53.789> on

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
tank 20 29 gallons and if you notice on

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
tank 20 29 gallons and if you notice on
the<00:00:54.239> bottom<00:00:55.190> right<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.420> dark<00:00:57.930> part<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the bottom right here that dark part so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.709 
the bottom right here that dark part so
they're<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.550> diatoms<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.750> algae<00:01:01.680> forming

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
they're more diatoms and algae forming

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.730 
they're more diatoms and algae forming
so<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> might<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:06.740> siphon

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so what you might want to do is siphon

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.510 
so what you might want to do is siphon
those<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> water<00:01:08.820> change<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:11.189> now

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
those out do a water change and you now

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
those out do a water change and you now
you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> keep<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.810> water

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you want to keep up with your water

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
you want to keep up with your water
changes<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.210> note<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.240> every<00:01:15.659> time<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> add

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
changes and note that every time you add

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
changes and note that every time you add
a<00:01:16.110> creature<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> mini<00:01:17.520> nitrogen

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
a creature you have a mini nitrogen

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 
a creature you have a mini nitrogen
cycle<00:01:18.869> occurring<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
cycle occurring so you're going to have

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
cycle occurring so you're going to have
this<00:01:21.000> happening<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> normal<00:01:21.930> part<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
this happening it's a normal part of the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.520 
this happening it's a normal part of the
tank<00:01:22.820> after<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:23.939> main<00:01:24.170> nitrogen<00:01:25.170> cycle

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tank after your main nitrogen cycle

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730 
tank after your main nitrogen cycle
occurs<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:27.020> you'll<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> keep<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
occurs and you'll want to keep up on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
occurs and you'll want to keep up on
water<00:01:28.950> changing<00:01:29.549> basically<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.450> any

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
water changing basically if you have any

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
water changing basically if you have any
problems<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:32.040> parameters<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
problems with your water parameters a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.960 
problems with your water parameters a
great<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> solve<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.729> water

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
great way to solve it is to do water

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
great way to solve it is to do water
changes<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> cure-all<00:01:39.710> just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
changes which is kind of a cure-all just

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
changes which is kind of a cure-all just
a<00:01:40.829> note<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.250> keeping<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> algae<00:01:42.390> green<00:01:43.049> algae

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
a note on keeping the algae green algae

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.160 
a note on keeping the algae green algae
down<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.100> tank<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.750> might<00:01:45.930> want<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
down in your tank you might want to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.100 
down in your tank you might want to
install<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.770> little<00:01:47.130> fan<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.840> installed<00:01:48.840> one

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
install a little fan we installed one

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.749 
install a little fan we installed one
that's<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> water<00:01:49.979> pump<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.490> an

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that's not the water pump that's an

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399 
that's not the water pump that's an
actual<00:01:50.939> fan<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> help<00:01:51.720> circulate<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.380> water

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
actual fan to help circulate the water

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.429 
actual fan to help circulate the water
and<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.540> does<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.990> moves<00:01:55.170> water

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and what that does it just moves water

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.160 
and what that does it just moves water
around<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.100> algae<00:01:56.640> doesn't<00:01:57.030> settle<00:01:57.899> too

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
around so that algae doesn't settle too

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830 
around so that algae doesn't settle too
much<00:01:58.430> your<00:01:59.430> hermit<00:01:59.850> crabs<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.509> snails

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
much your hermit crabs and your snails

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920 
much your hermit crabs and your snails
should<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.880> digging<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.030> some<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> green

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
should be digging out some of the green

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.130 
should be digging out some of the green
algae<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.439> eating<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.750> that's<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> bio

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
algae and eating it so that's the bio

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.059 
algae and eating it so that's the bio
cube<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.599> this<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.140> oceanic<00:02:10.920> biocube

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
cube and this is the oceanic biocube

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.629 
cube and this is the oceanic biocube
setup<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.300> saltwater
