we have the Gatling gun that's hooked up
onto<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> Hornet<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:18.180> setting<00:00:18.539> up

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
onto the Hornet that we're setting up

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.580 
onto the Hornet that we're setting up
for<00:00:19.760> setting<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.000> dogfight<00:00:21.359> v1<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.470> can

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
for setting up for dogfight v1 you can

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.960 
for setting up for dogfight v1 you can
see<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> scale<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> thing<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.760> just

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
see the scale of the thing is just

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.960 
see the scale of the thing is just
massive<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.470> our<00:00:25.980> test<00:00:26.490> weapon<00:00:26.820> mount

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
massive so we got our test weapon mount

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.540 
massive so we got our test weapon mount
here<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.529> getting<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> chair<00:00:29.310> right

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
here so I'm getting into the chair right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
here so I'm getting into the chair right
now<00:00:29.670> where<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.660> actually<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.470> interact

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
target up real fast for us so I got the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.979 
target up real fast for us so I got the
the<00:00:58.410> Gatling<00:00:58.770> gun<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> best<00:01:00.809> part

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the Gatling gun but also the best part

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
the Gatling gun but also the best part
about<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.350> whole<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.210> stuff

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
about this whole thing is with the stuff

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
about this whole thing is with the stuff
that<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> hangar<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.799> whole

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that we have in the hangar that whole

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
that we have in the hangar that whole
Hollow<00:01:05.189> table<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.600> actually<00:01:06.720> swap<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Hollow table you can actually swap out

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
Hollow table you can actually swap out
the<00:01:07.560> guns<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.250> check<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.030> if

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the guns so here check this out so if

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.429 
the guns so here check this out so if
you<00:01:09.240> guys<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:09.780> familiar<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you guys are all familiar with the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.750 
you guys are all familiar with the
hollow<00:01:10.619> table<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.310> pull<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
hollow table you can actually pull in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
hollow table you can actually pull in
the<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.750> weapon<00:01:12.930> mount<00:01:13.260> itself<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.610> go

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the the weapon mount itself and then go

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
the the weapon mount itself and then go
over<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> weapons<00:01:15.470> table<00:01:16.470> over<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.670> I'm

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
over to the weapons table over here I'm

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.359 
over to the weapons table over here I'm
going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> pull<00:01:18.119> over<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> other

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
going to pull over one of the other

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.640 
going to pull over one of the other
actually<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> laser<00:01:20.729> repeater<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.720> plug

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually the laser repeater and plug

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.370 
actually the laser repeater and plug
that<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.110 

and<00:01:26.380> then<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:27.010> see<00:01:27.610> it's<00:01:27.790> actually

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
and then you can see it's actually

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390 
and then you can see it's actually
swapped<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.660> actual<00:01:28.990> amount<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:30.100> weapon

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
swapped the actual amount and the weapon

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120 
swapped the actual amount and the weapon
itself<00:01:30.640> on<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.060> mouth<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:33.010> will

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
itself on the mouth and then that will

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.010 
itself on the mouth and then that will
completely<00:01:33.490> switch<00:01:33.850> out<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.240> actual<00:01:34.540> weapon

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
completely switch out the actual weapon

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.770 
completely switch out the actual weapon
that's<00:01:35.290> available<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:36.730> now<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.600> can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
that's available and now you can

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
that's available and now you can
actually<00:01:37.930> shoot<00:01:38.230> that<00:01:38.380> one<00:01:38.590> too

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550 

so<00:01:47.850> completely<00:01:48.270> changes<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.900> effect<00:01:48.990> changes

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so completely changes the effect changes

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100 
so completely changes the effect changes
everything<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.570> demoing<00:01:51.900> off

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
everything so it's a just demoing off

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080 
everything so it's a just demoing off
exactly<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.860> what<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.580> weapons<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.030> going

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
exactly like what the weapons are going

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
exactly like what the weapons are going
to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.270> capable<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.050> using<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.440> test

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to be capable and I was using this test

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
to be capable and I was using this test
platform<00:01:56.580> actually<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.150> test<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.840> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
platform actually to test out and like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.430 
platform actually to test out and like
the<00:01:58.050> Hornet<00:01:58.320> destructibility<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.550> course

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the Hornet destructibility and of course

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.230 
the Hornet destructibility and of course
totally<00:02:01.440> fixed<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:01.979> yet<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.880> least<00:02:03.030> from

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
totally fixed up yet but at least from

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
totally fixed up yet but at least from
here<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.690> can<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:03.990> test<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here you can actually test out all the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590 
here you can actually test out all the
different<00:02:05.280> weapons<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.509> were

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
different weapons that that were

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.609 
different weapons that that were
actually<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.080> pumping<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.470> for

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
actually going to be pumping out for

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
actually going to be pumping out for
