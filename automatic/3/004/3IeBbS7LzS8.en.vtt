00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
of Duke Nukem Forever it took about 15

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.560 
of Duke Nukem Forever it took about 15
years<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.050> produce<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.890> it's<00:00:49.430> well<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
years to produce and it's well it's a

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.710 
years to produce and it's well it's a
mediocre<00:00:50.840> game<00:00:51.370> it's<00:00:52.370> not<00:00:52.550> really<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.120> bad<00:00:53.449> I

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
mediocre game it's not really that bad I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.560 
mediocre game it's not really that bad I
think<00:00:54.020> it's<00:00:54.140> been<00:00:54.320> underrated<00:00:54.850> but<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.540> I

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
think it's been underrated but when I

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.600 
think it's been underrated but when I
say<00:00:56.840> underrated<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.500> doesn't<00:00:57.949> necessarily

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
say underrated that doesn't necessarily

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.160 
say underrated that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.059> buzz<00:00:59.300> game<00:00:59.629> still

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
mean it's the buzz game still

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.320 
mean it's the buzz game still
I<00:01:00.199> think<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.070> mechanics<00:01:01.400> themselves<00:01:01.730> in<00:01:02.210> it

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
I think the mechanics themselves in it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.630 
I think the mechanics themselves in it
are<00:01:02.480> solid<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:03.559> lot<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:03.890> variation<00:01:04.489> I

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
are solid there's a lot of variation I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.270 
are solid there's a lot of variation I
like<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.089> about<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.500> does<00:01:06.860> still

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
like that about it but it does still

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.150 
like that about it but it does still
feel<00:01:07.580> really<00:01:07.940> unfinished<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.650> looks

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
feel really unfinished and it looks

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.890 
feel really unfinished and it looks
pretty<00:01:10.580> unfinished<00:01:11.119> too<00:01:11.300> for<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> game<00:01:11.750> that's

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
pretty unfinished too for a game that's

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.889 
pretty unfinished too for a game that's
been<00:01:12.050> cooking<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:12.710> long<00:01:13.149> anyway<00:01:14.149> here<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.869> I
