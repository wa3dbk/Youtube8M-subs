00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:13.910
 this valve means zip stitching 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 come in for needle advancement and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 ordinary 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.669
 that is, for machines without a needle 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.210
 advancing this foot just means 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.419
 with a hole is for an ordinary car 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:35.120
 the extended hole is for the needle 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:35.120
 advances and so let's try 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.720
 how convenient is it 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:58.500
 unzipped it stuck to us 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.300
 man wheelbarrow is the beginning 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 so here are the thickenings 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 plastic i.e. retainer such it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 need of course 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.310
 unscrew and sometimes there is even a thickening 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.220
 which you can just 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 knocked over something and remove anyway 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.979
 Court more belt belt and retainer one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.590
 from this latch may be enough but 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.900
 it happens that one is very thickened 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.540
 another slightly smaller and he is at the very beginning 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.540
 will just bother you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.670
 and on the other hand 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.170
 principle here 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.780
 pretty convenient to give away necessarily 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.790
 do not forget to specify when you buy 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.379
 you machine with a needle advance or 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.379
 no 30 all
