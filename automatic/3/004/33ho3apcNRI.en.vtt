00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello to you marty hunter 3 thousand 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.740
 Steam is worth the long-awaited video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.679
 reviews on the technique of 100 roses a t and t tires 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 he replies the walker made the first time 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.150
 brand 2010 release 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 he is very different from his peers 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 since they were made a long time ago 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 early 1980s they were small 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 bad quality growth 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.150
 Well, as it were allowed to fix everything and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 make a perfect copy of a walker walk 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.989
 So we start to take it as you see it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.770
 he is very great to me to the knee 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.170
 just a perfect copy for the most 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 this fan of star wars he 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.840
 all hatches open 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 also the developers of this figure are very 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 slyly invented about the stores of here it is 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.739
 tops 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.559
 and it can only go down below 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.960
 open the hatch and it will be possible 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 let the hatchway skywalker in both the fifth and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 will allow and also on the other hand the same 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.170
 what does he open the cabin with him too 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.549
 it fits perfectly in it 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.220
 three little men sit there two or even 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.100
 the driver 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.650
 here they are they are vintage to me the seller 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 These models gave them for what I 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.340
 bought from him the answer walker he also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 reproduces all functions but it is not yet 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.869
 all he opens the trunk 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 which can be placed 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.220
 speeper bike he's so great that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.780
 compared to him on the small plane 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.299
 the figures seem very small 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.720
 let's take a sand for comparison 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:58.750
 troopers from san trooper and that's the answer 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.479
 the walker he's just gigantic also 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.490
 let's take a speeder bike 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.780
 it seemed to us great but it is not so 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.659
 versus answers 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.289
 Is it just that well, let us also 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.430
 take off 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.530
 from this he moves his legs well I personally 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.080
 I advise you not to move them because they can 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.870
 so break down because they are very hard 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.030
 hard with the genome he removed the rivets 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.070
 which is also not very easy to wear he 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:35.530
 reproduces the sounds that I give you now 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:41.160
 want to show the first sound lined up was 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.160
 the master jump is his 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.670
 this blaster known to us 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.040
 well he got me not in the ideal 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.560
 condition because it is not enough 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.590
 one blaster but it's a small loss 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.740
 in my personal opinion also he 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.210
 reproduces a bunch of other sounds they 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.210
 there is everywhere and on the remote control 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.850
 also when you push the button 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.209
 sounds he has a blue backlight and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.590
 red for beauty is me and this too 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:04:01.459
 very good at 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:05.000
 but no , he can also be kept 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.430
 pushed in so rocket and can be kept 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.970
 as if to say his head because his 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.599
 many for some reason compare the dog though 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:21.320
 I don't know why they do it 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:25.910
 well let's turn him over so he 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:31.940
 crushed our beloved corpse itself 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.650
 nothing terrible was damaged here is the view 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.380
 in front of you 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.490
 if you look closely you can see 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.669
 and behind the glass of two drivers data 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.669
 models 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.199
 here's the trunk from here 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.419
 accommodated the speeder bike you have it in 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.990
 bundle for some reason was not even though they 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:06.520
 very upset because i was buying 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:08.800
 only it opens here too hatch 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.820
 you can place all there stormtroopers 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.820
 or whoever you want 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:20.200
 here, too, there are special pimps on 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.870
 where it is possible to put figures 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.919
 It will turn out very beautiful if you set 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.919
 them in a whole row 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.530
 let's look at it from all sides 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.150
 Well, for today I hope you all 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.460
 liked 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.920
 someone didnâ€™t like it 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.640
 future good luck goodbye 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.640
 my friends
