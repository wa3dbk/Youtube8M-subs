here<00:00:53.699> neatly<00:00:54.329> stored<00:00:54.809> under<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.100> try

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
here neatly stored under there so we try

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.040 
here neatly stored under there so we try
and<00:00:56.460> design<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.360> storage<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and design all our storage to

everything that comes standard aboard

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.859

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
contract you know I really like a couple

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.690 
contract you know I really like a couple
of<00:01:13.210> punches<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:14.080> we've<00:01:14.350> done<00:01:14.619> for<00:01:15.159> example

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
of punches that we've done for example

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.190 
of punches that we've done for example
you'll<00:01:16.030> notice<00:01:16.360> how<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.570> shore<00:01:16.899> power

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
you'll notice how the shore power

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.139 
you'll notice how the shore power
connections<00:01:17.830> everything<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.670> actually

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
connections everything is actually

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.870 
connections everything is actually
inside<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.750> cockpit<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.770> lot<00:01:21.190> of<00:01:21.369> competitive

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
inside the cockpit a lot of competitive

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.120 
inside the cockpit a lot of competitive
bloats<00:01:22.149> have<00:01:22.420> outside<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.590> gun<00:01:23.830> wall

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
bloats have outside on the gun wall

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.730 
bloats have outside on the gun wall
which<00:01:24.820> makes<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.210> harder<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.630> reach<00:01:25.899> expose

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
which makes it harder to reach expose

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.649 
which makes it harder to reach expose
the<00:01:27.039> elements<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.000> when<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> boats<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
the elements and when the boats in the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.170 
the elements and when the boats in the
slip<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.080> can<00:01:29.200> easily<00:01:29.440> get<00:01:29.740> damaged<00:01:30.220> by<00:01:30.789> by<00:01:31.149> a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
slip it can easily get damaged by by a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.570 
slip it can easily get damaged by by a
pylon<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.380> all<00:01:32.590> those<00:01:32.830> connections<00:01:33.190> are<00:01:33.430> right

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
pylon so all those connections are right

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.309 
pylon so all those connections are right
here<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:34.149> long<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.509> your<00:01:34.659> battery<00:01:35.020> switch

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
here as long as your battery switch

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.740 
here as long as your battery switch
right<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.490> waterproof<00:01:36.940> container<00:01:37.509> up

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
right it's a waterproof container up

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.740 
right it's a waterproof container up
here<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.050> makes<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.440> easy<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.940> flip<00:01:39.940> open<00:01:40.149> and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
here it makes it easy to flip open and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.359 
here it makes it easy to flip open and
shut<00:01:41.020> off<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.170> Valerie's<00:01:41.830> as<00:01:42.039> you're<00:01:42.190> exiting
