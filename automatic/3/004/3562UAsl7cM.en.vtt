in the saloon like the Americans have

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.679 
in the saloon like the Americans have
instead<00:00:28.380> we'll<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> rather<00:00:29.310> nice

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
instead we'll get this rather nice

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.350 
instead we'll get this rather nice
hatchback<00:00:30.689> version<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.769> better<00:00:32.070> still<00:00:32.460> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
hatchback version and better still it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.069 
hatchback version and better still it's
quite<00:00:33.739> smooshy<00:00:34.739> looking<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:36.059> states<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.960> know

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
quite smooshy looking it states you know

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
quite smooshy looking it states you know
I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.829> could<00:00:37.980> probably<00:00:38.070> call<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I think you could probably call this a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
I think you could probably call this a
sports<00:00:39.660> tourer<00:00:40.160> if<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.309> was<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> market<00:00:41.850> for

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
sports tourer if I was in the market for

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
sports tourer if I was in the market for
a<00:00:42.030> new<00:00:42.180> Mondeo<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:43.079> probably<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
a new Mondeo I would probably go for

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
a new Mondeo I would probably go for
this<00:00:43.680> tour<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> model<00:00:44.550> over<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> hatch<00:00:45.270> there's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this tour a model over the hatch there's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
this tour a model over the hatch there's
two<00:00:45.989> reasons<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.610> saw

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
two reasons for that one is that you saw

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
two reasons for that one is that you saw
really<00:00:47.940> looks<00:00:48.210> great<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.600> prefer<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
really looks great I prefer the look of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.010 
really looks great I prefer the look of
it<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> second<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.300> space<00:00:51.719> well

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it the second is there's more space well

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
it the second is there's more space well
more<00:00:52.230> Headroom<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> back<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.610> what

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
more Headroom in the back and see what

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.130 
more Headroom in the back and see what
Ford<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.000> done<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> new<00:00:54.510> car<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> help

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Ford has done with a new car to help

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
Ford has done with a new car to help
make<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.680> sleek<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.250> lower<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
make it look more sleek is lower the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
make it look more sleek is lower the
roofline<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:58.050> fine<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> back<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
roofline it's fine in the back of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
roofline it's fine in the back of the
torah'<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.399> you've<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> more<00:01:00.300> square

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
torah' because you've got a more square

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
torah' because you've got a more square
shape<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.340> hatch<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
shape at the back but on the hatch it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390 
shape at the back but on the hatch it
does<00:01:03.570> limit<00:01:04.080> space<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:04.830> tall<00:01:05.159> people

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
does limit space and I think tall people

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130 
does limit space and I think tall people
when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> sit<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.210> knows<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> does

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
when you sit in it you knows it does

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.679 
when you sit in it you knows it does
just<00:01:07.439> touch<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.340> roof<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.479> little

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
just touch the roof which is a little

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
just touch the roof which is a little
bit<00:01:09.780> annoying<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> carry<00:01:10.830> adults

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bit annoying if you need to carry adults

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
bit annoying if you need to carry adults
in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.549> quite<00:01:11.939> regularly<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
front of the new Monday and you do feel
a<00:01:15.509> slight<00:01:16.049> step<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> quality<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> old

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
a slight step up in quality over the old

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.600 
a slight step up in quality over the old
car<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.659> design<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.130> Germanic

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
car the design it's kind of Germanic

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
car the design it's kind of Germanic
actually<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.930> grown-up<00:01:22.229> than

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
actually it's a bit more grown-up than

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960 
actually it's a bit more grown-up than
before<00:01:22.830> we've<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.100> lots<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> soft<00:01:23.790> touch

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

biggest change though is probably the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.640 
biggest change though is probably the
