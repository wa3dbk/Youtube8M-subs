hey guys Jimmy and today I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:10.290> four<00:00:10.769> unique<00:00:11.490> areas<00:00:12.059> key<00:00:12.330> areas<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
about four unique areas key areas to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.079 
about four unique areas key areas to
developing<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.500> higher<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.250> better<00:00:14.460> vertical

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089

quad<00:00:43.770> strength<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.670> noticed<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.149> keeping

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
quad strength but I noticed I'm keeping

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.470 
quad strength but I noticed I'm keeping
my<00:00:45.690> trunk<00:00:46.309> slightly<00:00:47.309> upright<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.239> higher

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a vertical leap you're going to have a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
a vertical leap you're going to have a
lot<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> basketball<00:00:52.710> players<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.940> trouble

jumping<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.840> there's<00:00:54.989> such<00:00:55.170> quad

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
jumping because there's such quad

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
jumping because there's such quad
dominant<00:00:55.770> jumpers<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.910> reality<00:00:57.300> our

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
dominant jumpers when in reality our

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
dominant jumpers when in reality our
glutes<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.780> our<00:00:57.840> hamstrings<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:58.920> vital

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
glutes and our hamstrings are very vital

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
glutes and our hamstrings are very vital
for<00:00:59.309> getting<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.059> jumping<00:01:00.300> higher<00:01:00.449> as

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
for getting up and jumping higher as

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.510 
for getting up and jumping higher as
well<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.620> brings<00:01:01.770> us<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> our<00:01:02.070> second

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
well that brings us to our second

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.429 
well that brings us to our second
movement<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> hamstring<00:01:03.809> extension

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
movement which is a hamstring extension

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
movement which is a hamstring extension
movement<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> difference<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
movement and the difference of this this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390 
movement and the difference of this this
is<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.659> example<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> dumbbell<00:01:07.650> Delic

has to extend backwards because we're

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
has to extend backwards because we're
very<00:01:17.220> weak<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.090> hamstring

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

I'm<00:01:35.040> demonstrating<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.640> step-up<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
I'm demonstrating a step-up because I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.399 
I'm demonstrating a step-up because I
have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> press<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.590> working<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.970> last

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
have to press up I'm working that last

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
have to press up I'm working that last
three<00:01:40.409> degrees<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.579> step-up<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.119> are

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
three degrees in the step-up that are

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
three degrees in the step-up that are
very<00:01:42.360> important<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.869> VMO<00:01:43.439> strengthen

about<00:02:37.829> that<00:02:38.129> will<00:02:38.280> work<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:39.359> more<00:02:39.540> glute

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
about that will work the more glute

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.059 
about that will work the more glute
contribution<00:02:40.319> we'll<00:02:40.409> get<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.980> more

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
contribution we'll get and the more

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.580 
contribution we'll get and the more
ankle<00:02:41.430> stability<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.120> will<00:02:42.269> work<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.409> right

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
ankle stability that will work so right

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.949 
ankle stability that will work so right
now<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.799> want<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> go<00:02:44.099> into<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.340> couple<00:02:44.459> random

about this for a workout like this to

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.440 
about this for a workout like this to
improve<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.159> vertically<00:02:50.669> you<00:02:50.939> want<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.239> vary

improve you vertically you want to vary
your<00:02:51.629> reps<00:02:52.579> four<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.639> eight<00:02:53.730> works<00:02:53.970> best<00:02:54.329> for

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
your reps four to eight works best for

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.409 
your reps four to eight works best for
increasing<00:02:55.290> your<00:02:55.319> vertical<00:02:55.500> jump<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.150> go

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
increasing your vertical jump you can go

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.879 
increasing your vertical jump you can go
higher<00:02:57.689> but<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.049> really<00:02:58.290> only<00:02:58.379> builds<00:02:58.769> your

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
higher but that really only builds your

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.860 
higher but that really only builds your
endurance<00:02:59.370> if<00:03:00.120> you're<00:03:00.299> having<00:03:00.599> if<00:03:00.780> you're

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
endurance if you're having if you're

endurance if you're having if you're
finding<00:03:01.049> you're<00:03:01.200> having<00:03:01.379> problems<00:03:01.530> later<00:03:01.919> in

games doing it

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.819 
games doing it
that's<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.659> conditioning<00:03:04.169> it's<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.409> ways<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
that's a conditioning it's a ways you

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.470 
that's a conditioning it's a ways you
but<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.069> can<00:03:05.189> also<00:03:05.219> bump<00:03:05.969> your<00:03:06.090> reps<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.299> little

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
but you can also bump your reps a little

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.030 
but you can also bump your reps a little
bit<00:03:06.569> higher<00:03:06.719> frame<00:03:07.079> Durin's<00:03:07.409> capabilities

but<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.669> most<00:03:08.849> part<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.180> see<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
but for the most part to see the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.420 
but for the most part to see the
vertical<00:03:10.169> jump<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.500> very<00:03:10.709> much<00:03:10.859> of<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.069> raw

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
vertical jump is very much of a raw
