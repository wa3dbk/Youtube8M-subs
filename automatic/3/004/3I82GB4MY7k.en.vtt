00:00:00.662 --> 00:00:02.052
Next is Jeong, the Unlucky

00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:04.182
His butt... Look at his butt.

00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:07.172
Look at his butt. So unlucky.

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:09.412
I heard that

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:12.022
"Unlucky" and "Disgusting" can never mix

00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:16.042
I can go to college when I do this?

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.252
Everyone only went to elementary school.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.092
Let's go to college. Let's do this!

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.642
Where should we go to lunch?
Should we go to the cafeteria again?

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:27.532
Oh! Right!

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:29.382
- Did you hear?
- I didn't.

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:33.072
We were having lunch on
Myeongsu's birthday.

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:34.502
"Hello, yes."

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:36.312
Myeongsu got a call in the middle of lunch

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:38.612
He just said yes a few times
and hung up...

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.052
"I have to go."

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.422
Oh... I remember that...

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:44.412
Why did you do that?

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:46.422
It was his wife.

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:48.412
She said we had to take Minseo home.

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:51.082
I never went to a party where
the birthday man just got up and left.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:54.592
- So he left?
- He left.

00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:57.282
- So the others were just...
- It was just us.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:00.672
Family Motto
All Goes Well When Your Family is Happy

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.002
How come you didn't even get me
a birthday cake?

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.682
Happy birthday to you.

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:09.302
The lights are still on.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.122
You can't just do this out of the blue.

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:13.432
- Oh, boy...
- Hey, it's okay.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:17.332
Happy birthday to you.

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:19.432
I don't eat chocolate cake.

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:22.062
Here comes the cake

00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:24.242
- That cake is huge.
- It's enormous!

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.592
A very big (?) birthday cake

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:28.532
The cake only the good people can see

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:32.632
Happy birthday to you!

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:34.032
Are there right number of candles?

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.182
The candles are over there.

00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:38.562
Because Myeongsu isn't good,
the cake looks opaque

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:40.842
Whoooo

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.362
Icing on the cake
Smashing the cake into his face

00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:46.372
You must be so happy.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:49.382
That was a fake one,
but this time, it's real.

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:53.792
Happy birthday to you.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.102
Ottoman shaped giant cake

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:00.612
What's happening?

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.812
Bigger than a wedding cake

00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:06.752
How exciting

00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:11.312
Your hair caught fire!

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:15.322
Stop it. Give me the knife.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.032
Here it is.

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:19.452
You'll cut your hand!

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:21.462
- The other way.
- Really?

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:23.162
Ouch.

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:26.602
It's upside down! The blade!

00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:28.802
You can't cut with that knife just like that.
You have to do this.

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:30.412
He finally got it right and is now
cutting the cake

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:32.692
Oh, this is hard

00:02:32.692 --> 00:02:33.952
Sideways.

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:36.662
Expert cake cutter

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.852
Top tier is removed
0:02:41.600,1193:02:47.295
He is so happy to be cutting his cake
down! The blade!
