after you send them out the door and so

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.489 
after you send them out the door and so
there's<00:00:54.819> been<00:00:54.909> sub-block<00:00:55.659> technologies<00:00:56.319> of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
there's been sub-block technologies of

there's been sub-block technologies of
old<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.829> address<00:00:57.219> this<00:00:57.399> issue<00:00:57.609> but<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
old that address this issue but the

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.729 
old that address this issue but the
problem<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.569> they've<00:00:58.749> relied<00:00:58.989> on<00:00:59.050> thickening

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
problem is they've relied on thickening

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.459 
problem is they've relied on thickening
up<00:00:59.889> the<00:01:00.100> material<00:01:00.550> or<00:01:00.940> using<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.479> stiff<00:01:01.899> crunchy

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
up the material or using a stiff crunchy

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.680 
up the material or using a stiff crunchy
metallized<00:01:03.399> layer<00:01:03.639> for<00:01:03.940> inhibiting<00:01:04.540> or

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
metallized layer for inhibiting or

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.170 
metallized layer for inhibiting or
blocking<00:01:05.140> migration<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:05.979> this<00:01:06.850> really

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
blocking migration and this really

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.270 
blocking migration and this really
compromised<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.079> performance<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:09.040> the

through the white areas of my graphic
and<00:02:00.609> it<00:02:00.670> could<00:02:00.820> also<00:02:00.939> easily<00:02:01.420> scorch<00:02:02.109> under<00:02:02.799> a

and it could also easily scorch under a

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.950 
and it could also easily scorch under a
high<00:02:03.070> heat<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.579> heat<00:02:03.729> press<00:02:03.969> but<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:04.810> all

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
high heat on the heat press but like all

the other stall stack materials the

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.690 
the other stall stack materials the
super<00:02:06.939> tech<00:02:07.149> sub<00:02:07.840> will<00:02:08.020> stop<00:02:08.320> only<00:02:09.129> takes<00:02:09.399> two

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
super tech sub will stop only takes two

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.490 
super tech sub will stop only takes two
steps<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.269> five<00:02:10.479> seconds<00:02:10.959> each

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
steps of five seconds each

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.920 
steps of five seconds each
heat<00:02:11.620> apply<00:02:11.920> as<00:02:12.250> low<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.150> two<00:02:13.420> hundred<00:02:13.600> and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
heat apply as low as two hundred and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.130 
heat apply as low as two hundred and
eighty<00:02:14.200> degrees<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:16.060> lessened<00:02:16.630> heat

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
eighty degrees and so this lessened heat

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.530 
eighty degrees and so this lessened heat
and<00:02:17.440> shortened<00:02:17.800> time<00:02:18.010> cycles<00:02:18.580> really<00:02:19.120> helped

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and shortened time cycles really helped

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.470 
and shortened time cycles really helped
to<00:02:19.630> keep<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.870> garment<00:02:20.500> unmarked<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.480> as
