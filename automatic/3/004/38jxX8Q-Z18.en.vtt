00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 we will talk about what is silent 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.400
 torment is when we land surface 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.309
 under the plant cover something 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.279
 Here is the question of what to cover today 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.859
 and talk here in this case here or 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 see the peat than he is good and see 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 virtually no weed that I show 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.059
 rarely no weed but there is a lack 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.710
 there is no peat weed but the soil after 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.450
 it becomes sour 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 you must wear dolomite flour here too 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 or beyond the moon embarrassed the soil becomes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.649
 acid but grass is not very comfortable 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.629
 nice to see how good 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 there is no disease in peat here bed 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.170
 please data tomatoes will not 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.800
 exposed they straight work lie 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.590
 we need sticks 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.110
 further down comes the manure of course manure 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 best now i'm moving another 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.020
 a place 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 a little bit far but no matter i 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.610
 show what the lack of manure protons I am 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.610
 said the flaw that after 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 sour becomes sour necessary 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.549
 extra measures moving another 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.549
 a place 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 here please pay attention to cabbage 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.259
 I mulch with manure what you see 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.580
 see right around here 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.580
 shortcoming in manure 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.240
 tear this grass wherever you look 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.880
 where not look plum wind 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.590
 Well, manure has great advantages in what plus 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.210
 taxes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.729
 harvest already you will see this year and in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.550
 next year if a peat harvest it you 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.759
 don't see much see after five 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.350
 years but 1 2 see the harvest already in this 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.800
 year 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.140
 accordingly draw conclusions that they live 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.230
 curtains owl here I personally do one year 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.390
 cake one year make 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.870
 dung and see pay attention 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 another grass all around the grass this manure 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.840
 grass comes to see water isotopes 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.360
 the earth will get all the trace elements 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.959
 all bacteria are necessary for russia 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.730
 which are necessary for plants 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:40.130
 further people taught straw i'm not 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.470
 I'm doing I drank too 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:48.590
 doing why not doing what 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 flaws there and make straws then 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.790
 a mouse can appear or can fungal 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.500
 an inset disease may appear here 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.440
 sawdust and then in general I do not recommend 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.959
 the reason is that if well you can sawdust 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.079
 if you do not dig, but if you dig 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.760
 the land will take away the sawdust will take away the nitrogen and 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.620
 there will be nothing to grow there will be 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.930
 poison is released and practically nothing 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.720
 it will be in sawdust in principle, but 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.269
 only in the autumn you need to clean keep in mind 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.090
 who wants to sawdust be careful what 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.700
 they must be removed later we are mulching 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.530
 it is very important agrotechnical 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.780
 events because 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.750
 watering decreases 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 about three times less watering ground 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.250
 lives its own life there bacteria here these 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.680
 I dig freely with my hand to the ruler 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.069
 there goes your life with your bacterium 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.050
 some humans and freedom there in the morning 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.120
 would be like no matter how polivka would pass 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.000
 whatever rain the earth will always be 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.110
 plump loose here please see hand 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.360
 free comes to see T-shirt all that 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.270
 mulching here in this case 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.280
 went growing in this side here too 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.640
 mulching too dung see 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.630
 well this autumn autumn taught autumn 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.420
 reads at all 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.489
 squeak I think not squeak at all it's cool 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.980
 is that there should be, we almost only 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.540
 autumn they spring 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.269
 but it must be separately of course to talk 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.100
 about the entrance 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.100
 Well, in general, I explained comrades 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.460
 please friends muller leave after 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.590
 planting loosen the earth and registered who 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.080
 something can say for the final strength allows 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.490
 buy manure or allow a torus or these 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.790
 same sawdust and straw 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.260
 but then it will be necessary to take 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.200
 Ripper as soon as possible for all sorts 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.530
 motegi and after abundant watering is necessary 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.190
 loosen the earth then in evaporation 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.380
 stopped so that the moisture does not evaporate 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.590
 the capillary were destroyed and normal 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.060
 hoes here so early mountains knock down all 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.060
 stay bye
