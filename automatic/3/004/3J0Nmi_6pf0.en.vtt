00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.660
 located in galley credit make yourself on 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.130
 the site was you cocks king.com there is 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.080
 will have for cheap everything is in the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.280
 description and well that's friends it's 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.440
 that more today we find ourselves for 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.050
 a new video for a striker squat 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.239
 as you saw so today he 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.110
 this is a very very hybrid team 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.250
 very very big budget guys so we 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.760
 will immediately start with the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.430
 guardian 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.450
 so he's italian we'll be quick 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.770
 it's still a presentation 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.320
 of hybrid equipped simply not 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.430
 it's a team that I liked a lot 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.630
 you will see that I did only two 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.410
 matches with some players this because 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.060
 because it's because I'm the ones 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.350
 have bought back or dusted and frozen 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.850
 received innovative common andorra and you 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.020
 had traded with him I had bought 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.729
 in short, we are not here to 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.089
 controversy so pull very good taste 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.920
 guardian 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.300
 one of the best league goalkeepers 1 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.979
 of the game finally it's the best goalkeeper 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.020
 league 1 league 1 of the game for me 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.340
 so it has its place in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.530
 this hybrid team simply 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.990
 can see what will happen next 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.630
 in right defender we have our friend 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.170
 dani alves then dani alves it's a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.970
 very very very good you know me I want 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.640
 a very very good right defender very 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.500
 good lateral offensives 4 stars of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.960
 90 speed technical gesture to the 112 of 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 shot 80.1 pass 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.580
 72 of head 79 of defense 83 of dribbles 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.380
 this guy is just a monster 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.119
 nothing to say it's a monster 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.369
 then we move on to the defender 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.890
 central it is obviously the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.900
 cargo he went so frankly his 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 price it is it is pitiful on this I 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.760
 surkiffe at 14 his epic clip and I'm 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.090
 sorry the so many of whom this guy 80's 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.799
 speed 83 heads 87.2 defend 73.2 because 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.360
 what more do you want friends than 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.159
 do you want more thiago silva he is 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.159
 exceptional is the dad of defense 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.810
 as I said on wire 13 next 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.920
 let's move on to the second central defender 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.260
 this is dande and so give it 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.959
 is very very very good its price is neither 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880
 the little ones like that of his 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.239
 cousin me even smaller are are 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.019
 taken speed 82 head 84 defense 70 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.579
 of dribbling 76 2 assists 4 1 m 88 7 of 9 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.730
 it's so good players 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:32.180
 so cheap and a side indian 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.950
 left it's about david alaba you 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 have there david alaba ex 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.700
 an excellent player watching the stats 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.819
 he can even play middle left cheyrou 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.000
 and 86 speed 70 shooting 82 2 passes 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.489
 82 of dribbles 77 of defense 69 of the lead 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.099
 15,000 credit if the price to pay 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.080
 but this player is very very very fast 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.610
 and very very good at defense 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.650
 then we go to both backgrounds 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.709
 central to this team so it's all about 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.470
 on this side of rami martinez and that 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.150
 there as you saw from luka modric 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.620
 so let's start with luka modric 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 so modric what is it 77 76 of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.970
 speed 76 shot 86 86 2 passes 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.680
 dribbles and gesture canvases 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.410
 4-star technique of mocking it's a 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.810
 very very complete player the very 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.549
 technique he puts sick passes 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.530
 he makes sublime passes in the game 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.150
 it's sick or very good stuff 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.250
 modric player I enjoy it a lot 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 player in real life actually 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.569
 so here is then climbed martinez so 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.739
 you only have a troll welcome 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.930
 anonymity 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.170
 frankly it's 57 speed on there 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.510
 not feeling at all 76 2 passes 76 612 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.350
 of dribbling 84 defense 92 of the head 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.380
 1 meter 90 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.730
 it's a very good recovery medium 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.030
 that's it for the collective I had 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.859
 need 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.109
 and it is a very good player one 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.970
 go to the offensive midfielder of this team 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:55.040
 this is iniesta iniesta a very very 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.230
 good player a very talented player 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.850
 in real life and on the game well 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.310
 obviously 4 stars technical gestures 4 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.620
 bad foot 88000 credit 75 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.410
 speed 312 two thirds 80 passes 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.310
 91 to pass 6 and I 91 of dribbles and 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.230
 then I bought with a card 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.000
 Hunters in no way that of 3 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.930
 the speed of 2 pulls them out of the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.209
 head 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.310
 after that it's a detail then we 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.720
 goes to the right attacker who is not 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:25.580
 not a matter of a middle right not 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.880
 omc but from a middle right here it is 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:33.289
 is to make the marsh then said 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.000
 maria di maria it is excellent 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.160
 certainly 32,000 credit there are some who have 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.300
 not being able to afford it but this guy 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.050
 4 stars gesture and 90 speed 70 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.569
 two shots 83 of dribbling 86 2 83 2 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.909
 passes 86 of green this guy he is 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.590
 so powerful Thursday should have 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.289
 88 years old pulls so much his shot said 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.180
 shi telly because honestly this guy it's 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.009
 a dinguerie as it's a trick of 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.259
 just sick 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.310
 then we go to the left forward 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:07.870
 you all know it's our friend 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.840
 franck hebert and so franck ribery 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.250
 I have nothing to add to the faith 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.050
 at which price is high there is no 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.300
 big world who can afford it here 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.770
 it's normal it's franck ribery we pay 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.870
 especially the name of the player also but 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.250
 look at these 4- star stats of 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.490
 bad foot five-star gesture 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.810
 91 speed technique 78 from ter 82 2 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.849
 because 93 drifting 47 games played 65 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.099
 goals 25 assists 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.900
 it's a sick thing that day guys 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.680
 it's even worse than di maria 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.770
 Gibert he is exceptional here it is 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.180
 the word is exceptional and computer the 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:49.719
 friends championship they park ddv ah no 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:54.130
 it's not about neymar but two of them 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:57.039
 waters but if their mother feasting there at 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.449
 mayor then thank you here that a 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.460
 million five hundred thousand credit in 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.130
 average 22 games 31 goals 20 assists 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.969
 decisive does not stop of itself 92 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:09.819
 speed 89-84 of passes 96 of 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.889
 dribbles he's exceptional clothes 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.969
 there who said yes to the subway except nine I 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.979
 will be easily moved by 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.810
 defenders now he's so 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.580
 fast so agile with the ball at 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.870
 foot you can do what you 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.039
 want with his four-star gesture 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.460
 technique if he had five stars has it 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.440
 make this dream 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.360
 so here it is sure the cherry on the 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.250
 cake no but seriously but if he 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.629
 is so agile as in the 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.039
 reality speaks it is sticking to his feet 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.050
 in a race it's a crazy thing 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.849
 like ribery ribery but if it's the 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.770
 even they have a small size they are 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.909
 ultra fast the ball sticks them to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.550
 feet the ball driving was going 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:40.000
 beautiful and after the technique does the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.000
 difference 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.680
 frankly so here's that for 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.380
 this hybrid team so liga bbva 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.790
 Spanish 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.590
 bundesliga then there is a little bit of the player 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.060
 of league 1 so it's a very very 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.890
 nice team friends I invite you to 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.020
 test it if you are rich enough because 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.760
 that there must be a very 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.410
 very good not this decree says it's 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.640
 really a big be builder friends 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.470
 which we do not know for how many 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.420
 but there for at least there for not far 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.210
 of 3 million maybe go that's 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.130
 maybe I'm exaggerating I'm exaggerating a 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.470
 little bit but there is a little 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.720
 less than 3 million credits so 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.070
 it's really a team of patients that 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.420
 I can advise you if you have them 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.160
 critics because with that you do 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.090
 carnage reassuring the defense was going 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.350
 so beefy 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.560
 the midfielder he is so 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.870
 accurate technical beefy also here it is 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.210
 there's nothing that can pass and the three 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.020
 attackers are so fast 92 90 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.090
 91 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.580
 that's an average of 91 speed in 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.770
 attack here I have nothing to say more 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.730
 this team is exceptional if 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.230
 you can test it 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.550
 do it and tell me about it 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.410
 new guys so hopefully 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.990
 this video will please you think to like 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.790
 to share with your friends
