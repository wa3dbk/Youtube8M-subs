00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.930
 Then I will continue, but it's just the strength of the electric field between the plates 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.059
 This becomes a uniform electric field and it is said to be 4 times s worth Keikyu for charge q 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.419
 It is why was this kind of scene 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 Hey by this you mean Eto 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:25.439
 How do you calculate next ? 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 Although it is said that this time the marriage is charged because it is connected to the DC power supply at this time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 Why not mark the voltage of the DC power supply 3 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:40.060
 If it is said that, the same voltage v will be explained first as explained earlier 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:46.810
 That Wake is charging to the voltage of the capacitor becomes the same voltage the first time the power supply 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:48.370
 Village year Satie It is a voltage v of the condenser is in a state in which the space and charging is completed 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:01:00.050
 Nekore 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:03.500
 Well, I think I want to destroy it with a formula . 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:10.460
 It is why the formula is made up of a say and gluttony all-ed was 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:16.640
 That is because the potential difference in a uniform electric field is that you should multiply the strength and distance of Tianma 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 In order to find the pressure by finding the potential difference between prefectures , the two points that lack the strength of the electric field 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.490
 Its expression was part = ed to say that I do it over a distance of between 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.670
 It now morning session of strength because is why there has been this kind of formula 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 If put to Fu that sense is it this well body between straight turn of the cat that we obtained this part 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 = ed The tape is ruined and this is good This is the strength of the radio 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.510
 Substituting the value of the store, and then the pen tomorrow part is requested to Ponyo here 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.240
 Desired 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:52.730
 But what is the purpose now is to seek the world that can be stored 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:59.810
 This is a group because it is the world 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:04.640
 I want this is to deform this equation in the form of 9 = In the You're is electricity that is stored in the main shrine's 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:10.220
 Specifically expressed in any expression if electricity to be stored in this Konç¦®'s if pour in is not 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.750
 You can understand that you are the one who can be 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.720
 Additives to be added to are required 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 Well, this is a very important expression, so this is the conversion that can be stored in Tsutomu now 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.470
 This it Is this very Is there significant funds but little is that is required 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:32.740
 Well for the purpose of explaining 1 in 4 lost parts and then dividing the day the US and it for the first time like this 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.920
 First of all, as an important point, this sister is open 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.040
 Charge q applied looks voltage v 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.800
 It means that it is proportional to the voltage 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:51.140
 This is the first important point The highness who is stored in the capacitor 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.790
 You can see from the wholesale that the command is a proportional relationship, so it is proportional, so the voltage is doubled 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.860
 If you charge 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.670
 If the voltage at the time of the house is also doubled by three, the world is also tripled 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.500
 That 's one important point first of all 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.090
 This is one and the other one is the one- fourth of the four loss series of jumps 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.760
 Bottom of the Dave 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:19.440
 This part depends on this value, and this value also changes depending on this value. 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.440
 I would like to think then that whether it is shown that say how integral say
