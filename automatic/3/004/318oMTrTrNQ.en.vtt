00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
system has an indicator light now I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
system has an indicator light now I
don't<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> operational<00:02:18.890> right<00:02:19.100> now<00:02:19.220> but

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
don't have it operational right now but

don't have it operational right now but
you<00:02:19.490> can<00:02:19.670> see<00:02:19.970> right<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:20.840> there's<00:02:21.050> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you can see right in here there's a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.560 
you can see right in here there's a
little<00:02:21.440> light<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.920> when<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> filter<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.300> new

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
little light and when the filter is new

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.380 
little light and when the filter is new
that<00:02:23.900> light<00:02:24.260> will<00:02:24.470> come<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:25.240> indicating<00:02:26.240> it's

only<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.870> filter<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.530> good<00:02:36.860> for

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
only the filter is good for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.500 
only the filter is good for
approximately<00:02:38.090> 94<00:02:38.930> gallons<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:41.000> light

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
approximately 94 gallons and the light

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.490 
approximately 94 gallons and the light
will<00:02:41.930> turn<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.890> green<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.820> red<00:02:44.500> when

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
will turn to the green and red when

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.130 
will turn to the green and red when
there<00:02:45.740> are<00:02:45.830> 20<00:02:46.220> gallons<00:02:46.610> left<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
there are 20 gallons left and that's the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.410 
there are 20 gallons left and that's the
warning<00:02:48.620> time<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.250> get<00:02:49.760> ready<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.210> need<00:02:50.360> to

replaced so you want to make sure you do

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.120 
replaced so you want to make sure you do
that<00:03:29.360> when<00:03:29.630> you're<00:03:29.810> actually<00:03:30.320> changing<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
filter now you can switch between

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.540 
filter now you can switch between
filtered<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.000> unfiltered<00:03:35.420> water<00:03:36.400> using<00:03:37.400> this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
filtered and unfiltered water using this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.220 
filtered and unfiltered water using this
lever<00:03:38.240> on<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.900> side<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:40.130> simply<00:03:40.520> turn<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
lever on the side and you simply turn it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.790 
lever on the side and you simply turn it
and<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.360> probably<00:03:44.630> see<00:03:44.840> there's<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.470> plain

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
and you can probably see there's a plain

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.620 
and you can probably see there's a plain
water<00:03:46.100> indicator<00:03:46.670> here<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:47.150> up<00:03:47.300> here<00:03:47.330> it

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
water indicator here and then up here it

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.480 
water indicator here and then up here it
says<00:03:47.660> Britta<00:03:48.200> indicating<00:03:49.070> it's<00:03:49.190> Brita

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
says Britta indicating it's Brita

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.340 
says Britta indicating it's Brita
filtered<00:03:49.940> water<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.170> bottom

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
filtered water and then on the bottom

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.160 
filtered water and then on the bottom
you'll<00:03:51.860> see<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.310> your<00:03:52.459> regular<00:03:53.270> unfiltered

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
you'll see that your regular unfiltered

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.740 
you'll see that your regular unfiltered
water<00:03:54.350> will<00:03:54.680> come<00:03:54.860> out<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.750> your

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
water will come out of this and your

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.280 
water will come out of this and your
filtered<00:03:57.170> water<00:03:57.380> will<00:03:57.680> come<00:03:57.890> out<00:03:58.040> here<00:03:59.290> simply

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
filtered water will come out here simply

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.860 
filtered water will come out here simply
switch<00:04:01.150> between<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.660> two<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.480> now<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
switch between the two like so now the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.230 
switch between the two like so now the
unit<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.260> attached<00:04:06.680> directly<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.580> neck<00:04:08.000> of

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
unit is attached directly to the neck of

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.370 
unit is attached directly to the neck of
the<00:04:08.420> faucet<00:04:08.959> with<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:10.120> twist<00:04:11.120> on<00:04:11.390> screw<00:04:12.110> on

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
the faucet with this twist on screw on

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.610 
the faucet with this twist on screw on
device<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:14.360> course<00:04:14.600> when<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.990> install<00:04:15.410> it

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
device and of course when you install it

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.370 
device and of course when you install it
you<00:04:15.650> don't<00:04:15.950> want<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> filter<00:04:16.670> attached<00:04:17.380> makes

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
you don't want the filter attached makes

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.229 
you don't want the filter attached makes
it<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.830> lot<00:04:19.040> easier<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.549> maneuver<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.150> get

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
it just a lot easier to maneuver and get

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.930 
it just a lot easier to maneuver and get
it<00:04:20.359> into<00:04:20.540> place<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.140> then<00:04:21.430> because<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.700> days
