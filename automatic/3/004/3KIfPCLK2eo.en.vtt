00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.920 

certain<00:03:18.430> ways<00:03:18.580> don't<00:03:19.120> play<00:03:19.480> anything<00:03:19.690> too

certain ways don't play anything too
long<00:03:20.110> just<00:03:20.140> cuz<00:03:20.530> since<00:03:20.680> YouTube<00:03:21.100> doesn't<00:03:21.460> like

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
long just cuz since YouTube doesn't like

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.880 
long just cuz since YouTube doesn't like
that<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:22.060> that's<00:03:22.870> not<00:03:23.050> pretty<00:03:23.380> much<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.710> for

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
that but that's not pretty much it for
