this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> clocked<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:17.840> 11.1<00:00:18.840> gigahertz<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.189> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this is clocked at 11.1 gigahertz but it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.870 
this is clocked at 11.1 gigahertz but it
comes<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:22.350> technology<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.250> allowed

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
comes with the technology that allowed

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.349 
comes with the technology that allowed
was<00:00:24.630> dis<00:00:24.960> dis<00:00:25.740> frequency<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:27.000> increased

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
was dis dis frequency for increased

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.660 
was dis dis frequency for increased
performance<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.920> play<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> game<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
performance so if you play a game on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.889 
performance so if you play a game on
runner<00:00:30.710> 18<00:00:31.710> eb<00:00:31.859> movie<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.360> processor<00:00:33.870> will

applications already pre-installed and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.729 
applications already pre-installed and
you<00:03:04.500> better<00:03:04.800> put<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> fresh<00:03:06.510> windows<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.620> it

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
you better put a fresh windows of it

you better put a fresh windows of it
that<00:03:08.250> will<00:03:08.489> work<00:03:08.520> actually<00:03:09.410> better<00:03:10.410> and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that will work actually better and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.010
