00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.040
 stupid 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.210
 by one of these courses

 twenty five thousand reais 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.850
 This course was done. 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 in the long term of one year 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.970
 questioned 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 the post-graduation limits in this area 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.660
 Estoril guy 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.600
 di pietro in this program 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 is the intent of the program is interesting because 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.150
 aimed 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.229
 reforms 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 qualified labor force to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.610
 this sector 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.020
 the repertoire of gas and oil does not become strategic today, which was only 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.400
 discovered now 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.420
 pre-salt happens 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.799
 remains have been 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.369
 and if the people of these students 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.379
 were not 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.359
 hired 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.469
 But until now 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.539
 the gift 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.969
 indeed we have information that 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.149
 petrobras itself 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:25.349
 is hiring people from other countries chile 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.489
 vaccine 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.249
 and this phrase 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.439
 companies that should be hired are not 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.430
 the fact is that the federal government has spent 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.929
 more than 300 million reais 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 with this program and yet 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.069
 this money is not being taken advantage of by either 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.689
 was invested in training 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:52.909
 without disabilities 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:53.959
 22 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.969
 helium students these students are not being now 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.490
 employee 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.119
 recorded losses 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.119
 administrative malpractice to embezzlement 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.840
 public money is a real nonsense its price is this but we have 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.679
 the outsourced companies needing 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.349
 This is difficult to stop. 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.719
 Petrobras 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.269
 but we have to take advantage of our Brazilian students 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.469
 regional leaders 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.959
 have received adequate training through 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.209
 this proimpe program 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.219
 industry mobilization program 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.919
 national oil 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:30.829
 at home 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.879
 in the hard fight and determined 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.129
 brazil to import the labor in the areas but we have highly 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.789
 qualified 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.510
 in our country then we want clarifications 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.109
 in relation to Brazilians 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.639
 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.780
 See what's happening. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.869
 Petrobras also needs to see 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:55.479
 Brasília 23 more than 900 million 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.389
 of real 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.609
 this problem now but we have to have a return 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.869
 the return of the public 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:07.499
 but we have to have to offer them in jars for the people who wanted 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.549
 Those 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.940
 His parents that we have several 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.139
 the engineers 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.779
 in the state of Sao Paulo 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.620
 who took courses that took the postgraduate course in the foundation 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.889
 getúlio vargas with public money 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.189
 could of the federal government 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.449
 a goal or left to chance are not being hired 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.240
 to work in companies 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.020
 is the outsourcing are 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960
 service for the works 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.639
 - I found much less contracted by Petrobras not only to the preservation of 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.309
 identity 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:44.309
 I lost the head of a crime against the public purse 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.770
 our contract 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.520
 we issued 300 million in training 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.400
 of skilled labor are those who now avail this labor 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.090
 In addition to the waste of public money, 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.509
 use of these 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.099
 the labor force 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.259
 we also created 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.330
 a false expectation 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.059
 122 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.590
 thousand workers 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.740
 they drove 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.749
 took a course 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.300
 adequate information 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.719
 the official information of the book on the chest 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:26.589
 they find themselves frustrated because there is no hiring ballmer not at least 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:28.450
 information about 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.850
 why or why you may be attending here 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.830
 first place 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.809
 a feather 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.449
 Petrobras 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.080
 the federal government 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.029
 and aol 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.029
 the ministry of mines and energy in the sense of dengue 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:42.220
 we needed 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.569
 I make projections for what 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.699
 all those workers who 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.499
 access to this training course with public money 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.499
 hired by 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.539
 mainly petrobras 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.800
 and the ministry 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.639
 the mines and energy 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.860
 regarding 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.779

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.919
 continues the complaint that city workers 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.570
 they are being hired 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.639
 looks 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.189
 of employment of brazil workers 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:24.430
 goalkeepers who did 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.430
 the prohibition on this, we ask that copies
