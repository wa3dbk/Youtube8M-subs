00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 and then wonder roth have here and I 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.490
 talk how I do this baby 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 be here 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.290
 good are actually the part of your asset 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.390
 paper mache down low and you will 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.230
 use this to get started is as follows 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 notice of a sheet of A4 paper is normal 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.010
 And you will do the following from Bram. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.010
 we have here on this piano here come here 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 so here he proposes and I can 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.769
 conceive what to do 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.930
 logically it is bigger the file stop 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.010
 is the short light here and offers a package 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.220
 in the world 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.869
 I got it and the good here in the middle did not 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.290
 I only counted this way there you get the 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.699
 beginning of the square program 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.790
 not small 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.630
 continuing is going to get it here because 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:17.250
 You're going to stick with your frame. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 the huge there you do the following goes 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.170
 pick up and anything that might 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 to draw I think if it was a pencil 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.190
 Here you go. You'll do it. 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.550
 it's a round thing 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.890
 here in the middle of that way is that you will 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.050
 cut it to here is under the part 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.130
 from above that will stay more or less 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.720
 similar to a click here 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.350
 Let's open to show to see with the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350
 magic 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.620
 here you go for a small part 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.620
 more or less 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.159
 then you will do the following're good 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.420
 Let's have here how the beauty does 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:17.120
 of the thigh that strikes and I will have 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 this already made one here in the middle cutting 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.020
 this part of the sporting make much smaller 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.030
 how much smaller but it will still be 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.440
 with a space the larger will stay 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.880
 much more conscious then very large then 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.319
 look that of supporting a little good by cutting 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.440
 and today I cut into four pieces 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.360
 choosing skirt here is going to have a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:52.150
 small part is exported 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.150
 there is a piece of 1 2 3 and 4 that will speak with 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:03.549
 max had a machine and this is a sticker 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:19.970
 from here you are adrift and you go when 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:30.920
 say something a little bit format 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:33.950
 so you can not be alone on the ball anymore. 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:43.880
 She'll get the most in the center. 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:48.859
 because the format is this faith 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:55.400
 parents magnet and you touch is 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:57.380
 hot little that is total in the part of 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.180
 down and getting a little smaller you will 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.670
 have to stop some accounts for later 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.220
 you get it in the right format 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.799
 this is from here it 's full memory 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.750
 on the mother street 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.229
 continuing what makes since 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.459
 then it 's just you happen to have a chance here 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.610
 pass you by 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.349
 two layers of a4 paper to harden 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.289
 and then I took that part of 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:32.979
 low so paper but much more 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.740
 thick and another 4 in the last layer 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.229
 to leave a little harder 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.129
 This is what I know I did with others. 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:45.879
 including that of 2002 is not 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:48.819
 that was crowded is ciccone is 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.599

 Beauty away your knot Boto do some 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.830
