00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
actually you see for instance that

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.000 
actually you see for instance that
during<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.870> first<00:00:57.140> week<00:00:57.380> you'll<00:00:57.650> be<00:00:57.829> losing

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
during the first week you'll be losing

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.370 
during the first week you'll be losing
much<00:00:58.460> more<00:00:58.730> weight<00:00:58.970> than<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.600> lose<00:00:59.840> during

much more weight than you lose during

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.160 
much more weight than you lose during
the<00:01:00.620> second<00:01:01.040> week<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.820> then<00:01:02.480> third<00:01:02.840> week<00:01:03.140> you

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
the second week and then third week you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.520 
the second week and then third week you
lose<00:01:03.710> even<00:01:04.009> less<00:01:04.369> weight<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:05.750> is<00:01:06.140> because

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
lose even less weight this is because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.430 
lose even less weight this is because
your<00:01:06.680> body<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.280> adjusting<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.360> making<00:01:08.750> itself

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
your body is adjusting and making itself

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.820 
your body is adjusting and making itself
more<00:01:09.770> efficient<00:01:11.020> now<00:01:12.020> here's<00:01:12.560> an<00:01:12.740> interesting

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
more efficient now here's an interesting

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.630 
more efficient now here's an interesting
point<00:01:13.630> most<00:01:14.630> people<00:01:15.170> think<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.130> high

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
point most people think that high

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.700 
point most people think that high
metabolism<00:01:17.630> is<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.080> best<00:01:18.830> thing<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.220> have

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
metabolism is the best thing to have

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.100 
metabolism is the best thing to have
then<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.830> can<00:01:22.040> eat<00:01:22.220> anything<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.910> want

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
then you can eat anything you want

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.110 
then you can eat anything you want
and<00:01:24.230> you'll<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.770> burn<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.130> up<00:01:25.370> right<00:01:28.120> there

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
and you'll just burn it up right there

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.700 
and you'll just burn it up right there
are<00:01:29.420> some<00:01:29.710> serious<00:01:30.710> downsides<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.710> what

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
are some serious downsides to that what

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.990 
are some serious downsides to that what
you<00:01:33.950> actually<00:01:34.280> want<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.450> slow<00:01:35.960> metabolism

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
you actually want is a slow metabolism

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.840 
you actually want is a slow metabolism
because<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.660> means<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.860> your<00:01:40.160> body<00:01:40.460> is

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
because this means that your body is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.770 
because this means that your body is
using<00:01:41.479> all<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:42.110> fuel<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.650> gets<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:44.210> all<00:01:44.510> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
using all the fuel it gets and all the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.750 
using all the fuel it gets and all the
nutrition<00:01:45.140> again<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.340> very<00:01:46.870> efficient<00:01:47.870> way

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
nutrition again in a very efficient way

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.740 
nutrition again in a very efficient way
you<00:01:49.760> see<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:51.470> more<00:01:51.830> work<00:01:52.220> your<00:01:52.940> body<00:01:53.270> has<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
you see the more work your body has to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:04.810 
you see the more work your body has to
do<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:56.300> faster<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.229> will<00:01:57.470> age<00:02:03.310> you're<00:02:04.310> putting

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
do the faster it will age you're putting

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.990 
do the faster it will age you're putting
a<00:02:04.910> lot<00:02:05.119> more<00:02:05.150> strain<00:02:05.869> on<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:06.700> system<00:02:07.700> in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
a lot more strain on your system in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
a lot more strain on your system in
general<00:02:08.800> if<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.489> have<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:11.680> metabolism<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:14.020> are

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
general if you have a metabolism and are

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.710 
general if you have a metabolism and are
using<00:02:15.709> whatever<00:02:16.370> you're<00:02:16.850> putting<00:02:17.270> into<00:02:17.600> your

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
using whatever you're putting into your

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.650 
using whatever you're putting into your
body<00:02:17.840> very<00:02:18.200> efficiently<00:02:19.239> then<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.450> don't

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
body very efficiently then you don't

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.050 
body very efficiently then you don't
ages<00:02:21.200> fast<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.530> by<00:02:24.530> water<00:02:24.920> fasting<00:02:25.640> you're

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
ages fast so by water fasting you're

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.860 
ages fast so by water fasting you're
able<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:28.010> down<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.730> metabolism<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
able to get down your metabolism and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.539 
able to get down your metabolism and
then<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.400> start<00:02:32.030> repeating<00:02:32.720> properly<00:02:33.549> you

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
then if you start repeating properly you

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.610 
then if you start repeating properly you
can<00:02:34.760> maintain<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:36.110> rather<00:02:36.920> low<00:02:37.730> metabolism<00:02:38.620> so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
can maintain a rather low metabolism so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.460 
can maintain a rather low metabolism so
you<00:02:39.680> won't<00:02:40.280> need<00:02:41.410> huge<00:02:42.410> quantities<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> food

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
you won't need huge quantities of food

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.640 
you won't need huge quantities of food
instead<00:02:45.470> you'll<00:02:45.709> be<00:02:45.890> using<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.459> food<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
instead you'll be using the food and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.400 
instead you'll be using the food and
assimilating<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:50.150> much<00:02:50.510> more<00:02:50.900> efficient

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
assimilating it in a much more efficient

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.259 
assimilating it in a much more efficient
way<00:02:52.299> that's<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.690> way<00:02:54.250> I'm<00:02:55.250> going<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.940> try<00:02:56.209> to

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
way that's the way I'm going to try to

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.699 
way that's the way I'm going to try to
go<00:02:56.510> okay

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
go okay

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.720 
go okay
this<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.820> day<00:02:58.910> number<00:02:59.090> 17
