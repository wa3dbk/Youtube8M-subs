00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
case your browser is incompatible with

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.609 
case your browser is incompatible with
multiple<00:02:06.940> backgrounds<00:02:07.480> then<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.470> will

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
multiple backgrounds then it will

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.520 
multiple backgrounds then it will
display<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.280> fallback<00:02:09.850> image<00:02:10.270> okay<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.380> in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
display this fallback image okay just in

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.120 
display this fallback image okay just in
case<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> I'm<00:02:13.840> creating<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.320> fallback<00:02:14.590> image

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
case so I'm creating a fallback image

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.690 
case so I'm creating a fallback image

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
background CSS property but just in case

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.890 
background CSS property but just in case
this<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.860> come<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.070> next<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:28.660> I'm<00:02:28.720> going<00:02:28.780> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
and ok once again guys what happens here

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700 
and ok once again guys what happens here
is<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.730> dev<00:02:51.090> comes<00:02:51.360> up<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.990> dimensions<00:02:52.530> of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
is that a dev comes up the dimensions of

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.370 
is that a dev comes up the dimensions of
which<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:55.260> gonna<00:02:55.650> call<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> file<00:02:56.250> test<00:02:57.230> ok

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
which I'm gonna call the file test ok

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.500 
which I'm gonna call the file test ok
so<00:02:59.040> there<00:02:59.370> were<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.850> dimensions<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.360> which

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.120 
screen but it still does not have the
multiple<00:03:08.940> images<00:03:09.180> which<00:03:09.630> will<00:03:09.900> follow<00:03:10.230> soon

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
multiple images which will follow soon

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.670 
multiple images which will follow soon
right<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.540> what<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:12.780> gonna<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:13.530> gonna

right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.640 
right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
switch<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> code<00:03:14.790> view<00:03:15.390> guys<00:03:15.660> okay<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
switch to the code view guys okay and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.690 
switch to the code view guys okay and
then<00:03:17.900> being<00:03:18.900> I'm<00:03:19.470> gonna<00:03:19.740> fetch<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.280> class

then being I'm gonna fetch the class
called

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
called

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.540 
called
s<00:03:21.690> class<00:03:22.140> where<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> background<00:03:23.130> image

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
s class where we have a background image

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.510 
s class where we have a background image
this<00:03:24.120> image<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.840> be<00:03:24.960> used<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.530> fallback

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
this image will be used as the fallback

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.030 
this image will be used as the fallback
image<00:03:27.060> guys<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.750> case<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.560> multiple

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
image guys just in case the multiple

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.270 
image guys just in case the multiple
backgrounds<00:03:29.700> are<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.420> shown<00:03:30.690> guys<00:03:30.950> css3<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
backgrounds are not shown guys css3 is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.180 
backgrounds are not shown guys css3 is
compatible<00:03:32.970> with<00:03:33.180> most<00:03:33.540> browsers<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.830> recent

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
compatible with most browsers the recent

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.940 
compatible with most browsers the recent
ones<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.580> recent<00:03:35.910> versions<00:03:36.360> okay<00:03:37.110> but<00:03:37.770> if

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
ones the recent versions okay but if

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.430 
ones the recent versions okay but if
you're<00:03:38.100> using<00:03:38.280> an<00:03:38.580> older<00:03:38.700> browser<00:03:39.120> an<00:03:40.080> older

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you're using an older browser an older

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.370 
you're using an older browser an older
version<00:03:40.650> an<00:03:41.180> earlier<00:03:42.180> version<00:03:42.420> then<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
version an earlier version then the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.950 
version an earlier version then the
chances<00:03:43.830> are<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.760> image<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.420> fallback

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
chances are that this image the fallback

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.500 
chances are that this image the fallback
image<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.650> show<00:03:46.680> true<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.270> actual

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
image will show true and not the actual

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.470 
image will show true and not the actual
multiple<00:03:49.500> images<00:03:49.800> okay<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:51.060> what<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:51.300> gonna

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
multiple images okay so what I'm gonna

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.460 
multiple images okay so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.810> I'm<00:03:51.959> gonna<00:03:52.580> hand<00:03:53.580> code<00:03:54.000> now<00:03:54.320> now<00:03:55.320> it's

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
do is I'm gonna hand code now now it's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.820 
do is I'm gonna hand code now now it's
my<00:03:55.800> turn<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.040> hand<00:03:56.459> code<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.350> see<00:03:58.350> how<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.590> can

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
my turn to hand code and see how we can

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.170 
my turn to hand code and see how we can
actually<00:03:58.950> achieve<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.610> multiple<00:04:00.090> images

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
actually achieve the multiple images

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.880 
actually achieve the multiple images
effect<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:00.870> I'm<00:04:00.930> going<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.110> say<00:04:01.260> background

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
effect so I'm going to say background

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.960 
effect so I'm going to say background
and<00:04:03.620> then<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:05.450> need<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.600> say

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.960 

URL

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.630 

and<00:04:16.970> then<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.269> need<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.540> specify<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.200> URL<00:04:18.640> and

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
and then I need to specify the URL and

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.910 
and then I need to specify the URL and
go<00:04:19.790> like<00:04:19.970> this

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.490 

PG<00:04:25.210> dot<00:04:26.210> jpg<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.310> first<00:04:28.550> mate<00:04:28.820> guys<00:04:29.500> more
