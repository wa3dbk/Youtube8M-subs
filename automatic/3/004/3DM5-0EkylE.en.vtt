probably will have seen in previous
videos<00:00:43.269> that<00:00:43.719> presumably<00:00:44.139> a<00:00:44.319> couple<00:00:44.559> days<00:00:44.710> ago

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
videos that presumably a couple days ago

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.529 
videos that presumably a couple days ago
something<00:00:45.100> like<00:00:45.219> that<00:00:45.460> didn't<00:00:46.179> go<00:00:46.299> so<00:00:46.329> well

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
something like that didn't go so well

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.529 
something like that didn't go so well
the<00:00:46.989> six<00:00:47.260> lot<00:00:47.559> did<00:00:47.769> not<00:00:48.069> work<00:00:48.460> for<00:00:48.489> me<00:00:48.789> so<00:00:49.299> I'm

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
the six lot did not work for me so I'm

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.149 
the six lot did not work for me so I'm
gonna<00:00:49.719> have<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:49.960> remind<00:00:50.289> Gabe<00:00:50.799> 6<00:00:51.760> law<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:54.039> we

go equals lucky that's so much there we

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.660 
go equals lucky that's so much there we
go<00:01:00.519> that<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.149> probably<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:02.049> most<00:01:02.670> unreadable

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
go that is probably the most unreadable

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.830 
go that is probably the most unreadable

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
you we've got you before and what the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.110 
you we've got you before and what the
fuck<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.440> empty<00:01:14.830> line<00:01:15.010> bulldozer<00:01:15.610> man<00:01:15.970> it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
fuck the empty line bulldozer man it

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.600 
fuck the empty line bulldozer man it
picked<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> right<00:01:17.020> collection<00:01:17.740> once<00:01:18.130> again

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
picked the right collection once again

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.840 
picked the right collection once again
and<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.990> didn't<00:01:20.500> give<00:01:20.710> me<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.920> fade<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
and it didn't give me the fade the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.600 
and it didn't give me the fade the
chances<00:01:22.420> are<00:01:23.010> incredible<00:01:24.010> i<00:01:24.160> don't<00:01:24.340> know<00:01:24.430> why

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
chances are incredible i don't know why

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.940 
chances are incredible i don't know why
it<00:01:24.640> keeps<00:01:25.000> picking<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.600> fucking<00:01:26.230> bulldozer

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
it keeps picking the fucking bulldozer

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.000 
it keeps picking the fucking bulldozer
but<00:01:27.730> that<00:01:27.910> is<00:01:28.120> incredibly<00:01:28.870> frustrating<00:01:29.590> as<00:01:29.830> we

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
but that is incredibly frustrating as we

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.950 
but that is incredibly frustrating as we
could<00:01:30.220> have<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.580> heard<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.970> fade<00:01:31.150> again<00:01:31.420> on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
could have just heard the fade again on

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.110 
could have just heard the fade again on
our<00:01:32.020> very<00:01:32.800> first<00:01:33.160> attempt<00:01:33.670> which<00:01:33.850> would<00:01:34.060> have

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
our very first attempt which would have

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.250 
our very first attempt which would have
been<00:01:34.180> awesome<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:35.070> second<00:01:36.070> attempt<00:01:36.370> now

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
been awesome but second attempt now

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.990 
been awesome but second attempt now
and<00:01:40.620> that's<00:01:41.620> my<00:01:41.740> even<00:01:42.100> how<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.220> spell<00:01:42.310> tempt

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and that's my even how you spell tempt

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.210 
and that's my even how you spell tempt
so<00:01:43.180> I'm<00:01:43.270> scribble<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.290> out<00:01:44.470> pretend<00:01:45.160> that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
so I'm scribble this out pretend that

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.720 
so I'm scribble this out pretend that
was<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> all<00:01:46.120> part<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.570> plan<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:48.460> they

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
was a all part of the plan and in they

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.610 
was a all part of the plan and in they
go<00:01:48.910> once<00:01:49.270> again<00:01:49.480> obviously<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.230> think<00:01:50.470> we're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
go once again obviously I think we're

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.230 
go once again obviously I think we're
probably<00:01:50.740> going<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.070> get<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.850> old<00:01:52.000> tech

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
probably going to get that the old tech

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.080 
probably going to get that the old tech
9<00:01:52.450> quarts<00:01:52.780> here<00:01:53.260> because<00:01:53.800> luck<00:01:54.160> does<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:54.820> seem

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
9 quarts here because luck does not seem

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.850 
9 quarts here because luck does not seem
to<00:01:55.180> be<00:01:55.300> on<00:01:55.480> my<00:01:55.660> side<00:01:55.840> at<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.140> moment<00:01:56.440> there<00:01:56.740> we

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
to be on my side at the moment there we

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.430 
to be on my side at the moment there we
go<00:01:57.010> take<00:01:57.310> 9<00:01:57.490> quarts<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.090> can't<00:01:58.720> believe<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.050> it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
go take 9 quarts I can't believe that it

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.050 
go take 9 quarts I can't believe that it
picked<00:01:59.620> from<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.830> creek<00:02:00.310> collection<00:02:00.940> again

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
picked from the creek collection again

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.290 
picked from the creek collection again
but<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> picked<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:01.960> bucking<00:02:02.350> bull<00:02:02.590> dozer<00:02:03.300> I'm

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
but I picked up bucking bull dozer I'm

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.090 
but I picked up bucking bull dozer I'm
still<00:02:04.630> pretty<00:02:04.810> frustrated<00:02:05.080> about<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.890> but

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
still pretty frustrated about that but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.010 
still pretty frustrated about that but
we<00:02:06.160> have<00:02:06.250> got<00:02:06.370> two<00:02:06.610> more<00:02:06.850> attempts<00:02:07.300> here<00:02:07.480> of
