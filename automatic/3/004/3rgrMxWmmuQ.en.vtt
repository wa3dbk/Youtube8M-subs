 this sequence of the contested by small objects play left at home 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.209
 the cost of these children because at that age they take them all to the mouth 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.449
 the use of cables inadequate food according to age mainly 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.869
 harder foods like peanut popcorn that are practically banned

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 but which first aid 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.420
 drowning in the sequence what can be done well the first thing that should 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.919
 to know if the child is 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.470
 breathing crying or talking 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.110
 if she is doing one of these things absolutely nothing should be done 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.430
 in which the offspring should be referred to the referral service for 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.360
 be evaluated by doctors now when the child does not breathe does not speak 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.420
 should not be applied by the maneuvers that have been demonstrated with the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.270

 liabilities applied by pakistan to take care of the environment have chosen 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.270
 appropriate toys and active prevention would be in the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.570
 of the child according to their tendency and with that age 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.370
 for example if the child at age 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.030
 that she can understand very well that I as the dog of the German commendation 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.110
 can get close she can be bitten 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.650
 certain and she's near the fire she knows the one who comes in the place of herself 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.680
 parents should also guide children to take 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.099
 to prevent accidents so that this information only 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.240

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.520
 the biggest victims 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.449

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.499
 oscar is not a distraction accidents happen 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.709
 a survey of the health department of são paulo that of children and 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.069

 38% go to the hospital because of burns, falls and intoxication. 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.229
 The survey also shows that in this age group, accidents that can be 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.240
 avoided 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.419
 with 40% of the deaths in 16% of cases 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.009
 the children die suffocated 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.389
 Twenty-five percent of them are runners-up and first in 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.499
 27% of the cases the child dies drowned for example in the party that do not know that 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:22.369

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.760
 with sharp knives and sharp objects 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.990
 The correct thing is that these facts all these equipments to that they are in the place that 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.969
 is treated that a small child 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.430
 and this is very dangerous portugal at the time of cooking 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.149
 always with the word-of-mouth inside the pan that was the most adequate 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.959
 the cleaning products should always remain in the top closed jobs 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.770
 but are the most dangerous remedies in cases of intoxication all 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.619
 medicines 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:10.249
 also locked in the debates of the children here to date very easy to 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:15.719
 to be reached is that this can be confused with bullet she does not know which 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.949
 risk they run is a moratorium at home only damages that parents is time to 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.289
 to give the remedy will be because of the fact that the average navy password is something that 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.389
 valley is another ever place farhad heated children 

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:31.919
 in the visit to the house of rose the coordinator of the NGO safe child 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.050

 little dot 

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:50.929
 that happens 

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.779
 that's when I said win 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:59.509
 then she will talk to the mother moments in the modality was changing type of problem 

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.009
 they were babies 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.710
 this problem has cat in the mouth today they will somersaults on that I will speak 

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.889
 she becomes star in the room 

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:09.919
 then I would not have 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.199
 the problem area if these end up relaxing in the home environment and 

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.779
 they do not realize all those risks
