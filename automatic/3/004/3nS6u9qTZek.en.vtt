00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
honestly are not going to do anything at

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
honestly are not going to do anything at
all<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:47.160> honestly<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> actually<00:00:48.390> predicted

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
all now honestly I actually predicted

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
all now honestly I actually predicted
him<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> switch<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.280> didn't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
him here to switch out that didn't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
him here to switch out that didn't
happen<00:00:51.090> unfortunately<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.590> thought<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
happen unfortunately I just thought that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.139 
happen unfortunately I just thought that
maybe<00:00:53.070> he<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.489> switch<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.940> because

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
maybe he would switch up because

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.369 
maybe he would switch up because
obviously<00:00:54.329> couldn't<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.079> anything<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
obviously couldn't really do anything to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
obviously couldn't really do anything to
me<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.610> end<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.820> going

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
me at all so now I'm gonna end up going

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
me at all so now I'm gonna end up going
from<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.480> he<00:00:57.539> switches<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.590> goes<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> new

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.330 
can at least just take some hits from
the<00:01:18.840> sing<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.009> he

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the sing a little bit better but he

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
the sing a little bit better but he
actually<00:01:20.549> puts<00:01:21.119> me<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.420> sleep<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.950> mean<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
actually puts me to sleep so I mean I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.740 
actually puts me to sleep so I mean I
guess<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:23.970> terrible<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> guess

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
guess it's not terrible I guess

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
guess it's not terrible I guess
something<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.979> asleep<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
something has to be put asleep by the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
something has to be put asleep by the
movies<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.540> guess<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> should<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.320> Rotom

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
movies and I guess it should be Rotom

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
movies and I guess it should be Rotom
now<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.490> bowl<00:01:29.790> corona

flare<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.479> does<00:01:39.689> nothing<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
flare and it really does nothing at all

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.780 
flare and it really does nothing at all
because<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.770> back<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.400> road<00:01:41.610> am<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because they go back into my road am I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
because they go back into my road am I
trying<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> thing<00:01:42.299> awake<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> it's

trying to get this thing awake and it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.080 
trying to get this thing awake and it's
not<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.130> working<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.000> now

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
not really working out that well so now

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
not really working out that well so now
I'm<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.299> switch<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.720> again<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.500> gonna<00:01:47.009> go

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I'm gonna switch out again I'm gonna go

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
I'm gonna switch out again I'm gonna go
to<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.369> gyarados<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.450> i<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to my gyarados just because i know is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
to my gyarados just because i know is
mega<00:01:49.500> absol<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.520> can't<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.909> anything<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mega absol really can't do anything to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
mega absol really can't do anything to
me<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:52.320> gonna<00:01:52.649> end<00:01:52.770> up

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
me at all and then he's gonna end up

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
me at all and then he's gonna end up
switching<00:01:53.159> out<00:01:53.430> obviously<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.390> his

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
switching out obviously because his

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
switching out obviously because his
absolute<00:01:55.439> can't<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.740> anything<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.159> my

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
absolute can't do anything to my

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.620 
absolute can't do anything to my
gyarados<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.030> mega<00:01:57.270> evolve

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
gyarados then I'm gonna mega evolve

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
gyarados then I'm gonna mega evolve
which<00:01:57.930> especially<00:01:58.500> means<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.399> know

actually predict him to go in his
scarberry<00:04:24.380> that's<00:04:24.710> why<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.010> go<00:04:25.190> for<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.430> stone

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
scarberry that's why I go for the stone

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.090 
scarberry that's why I go for the stone
edge<00:04:26.000> they're<00:04:26.270> very<00:04:27.080> very<00:04:27.410> important<00:04:27.950> there

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
edge they're very very important there

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.500

if<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.250> did<00:04:28.430> not<00:04:28.550> get<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.850> off<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.330> then

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
if I did not get that off and then

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.910 
if I did not get that off and then
skarmory<00:04:30.020> could<00:04:30.200> have<00:04:30.290> pretty<00:04:30.680> much<00:04:30.710> just

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
skarmory could have pretty much just

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.010 
skarmory could have pretty much just
wall<00:04:31.250> my<00:04:31.460> team<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.790> entire<00:04:31.940> time<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.570> probably

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
wall my team the entire time I probably

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.330 
wall my team the entire time I probably
had<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.260> second<00:04:33.560> chance<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.860> get<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.040> stone

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
had a second chance to get that stone

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.280 
had a second chance to get that stone
edge<00:04:34.520> off<00:04:34.730> too<00:04:35.120> because<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.780> know<00:04:35.960> he

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
edge off too because you know he

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.200 
edge off too because you know he
obviously<00:04:36.530> switched<00:04:36.980> into<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.490> but<00:04:37.730> still<00:04:38.060> I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
obviously switched into that but still I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.700 
obviously switched into that but still I
didn't<00:04:38.390> want<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.570> risk<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.530> I'm<00:04:39.620> gonna

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710
