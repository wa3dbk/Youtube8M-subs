00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
make sure that it's free I'll do it a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.729 
make sure that it's free I'll do it a
second<00:02:20.849> time<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:22.670> there<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.819> have<00:02:23.849> it

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.770 

actually<00:02:28.739> may<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.790> heated<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.599> it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
actually may not be as heated up as it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually may not be as heated up as it
should<00:02:30.989> be<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.440> one<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.860> reasons<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
should be that's one of the reasons you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.800 
should be that's one of the reasons you
need<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.580> let<00:02:33.180> your<00:02:33.390> ribbon<00:02:33.959> your<00:02:34.620> tool<00:02:35.810> heat

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
need to let your ribbon your tool heat

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.940 
need to let your ribbon your tool heat
up<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.709> use<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.250> point<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.950> metal

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
up so use that point put it on the metal

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.420 
up so use that point put it on the metal
and<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.970> drag<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.450> through<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.620> go<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and just drag it through there we go and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.240 
and just drag it through there we go and
then<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.569> move<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> aside<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.860> tool<00:02:47.069> is

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
then just move it aside and your tool is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.120 
then just move it aside and your tool is
going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> smoke<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.120> little<00:02:48.360> bit<00:02:49.069> okay<00:02:50.069> so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
going to smoke just a little bit okay so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.960 
going to smoke just a little bit okay so
then<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:50.970> want<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.299> make<00:02:52.290> sure<00:02:52.970> that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
then you just want to make sure that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.440 
then you just want to make sure that
it's<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.920> clean<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> clean

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
it's all clean because I like a clean

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
it's all clean because I like a clean
cut<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.930> my<00:02:58.049> ribbon<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:04.019> hear<00:03:04.260> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
cut on my ribbon and you can hear that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.729 
cut on my ribbon and you can hear that
that's<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.370> stiffness<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:06.510> takes<00:03:06.870> its<00:03:07.349> ears

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that's the stiffness it takes its ears

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.720 
that's the stiffness it takes its ears
at<00:03:07.950> all<00:03:08.069> at<00:03:08.190> once<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> little

different times just to make sure and
you<00:04:35.250> can<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.550> they're<00:04:35.699> separated<00:04:36.210> there<00:04:36.979> now

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
you can see they're separated there now

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:48.140 
you can see they're separated there now
you<00:04:39.539> just<00:04:39.750> put<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:39.960> down<00:04:45.319> okay<00:04:46.789> so<00:04:47.789> there<00:04:48.000> you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150
