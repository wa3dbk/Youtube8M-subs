in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.780> video<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.250> tell<00:00:02.610> you

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this video I'm going to tell you

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.329 
in this video I'm going to tell you
about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.419> chemistry<00:00:03.929> behind<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.830> formation

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
about the chemistry behind the formation

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.490 
about the chemistry behind the formation
of<00:00:05.430> yogurt<00:00:05.819> from<00:00:06.060> milk<00:00:06.330> what<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
of yogurt from milk what is the

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.910 
of yogurt from milk what is the
difference<00:00:07.950> between<00:00:08.069> these<00:00:08.580> two<00:00:08.849> food<00:00:09.059> items

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
difference between these two food items

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.600 
difference between these two food items
well<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.550> obvious<00:00:11.759> difference<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:13.340> milk<00:00:14.340> is

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
well the obvious difference is milk is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.590 
well the obvious difference is milk is
liquid<00:00:16.010> and<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:19.410> yogurt<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> thick<00:00:20.670> semi

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
liquid and the yogurt is thick semi

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.550 
liquid and the yogurt is thick semi
solid<00:00:23.779> why<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.840> happens<00:00:26.900> it's<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
solid why this happens it's because of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
solid why this happens it's because of
one<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> proteins<00:00:29.519> found<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.029> milk<00:00:30.330> known

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
one of the proteins found in milk known

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.340 
one of the proteins found in milk known
as<00:00:31.109> casein<00:00:31.880> Cassini<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.059> soluble<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.719> milk<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
as casein Cassini is soluble in milk in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.580 
as casein Cassini is soluble in milk in
the<00:00:35.040> form<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.540> micelles<00:00:36.590> at<00:00:37.879> neutral<00:00:38.879> pH<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the form of micelles at neutral pH it is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.290 
the form of micelles at neutral pH it is
insoluble<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.430> yogurt<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> becomes<00:00:43.260> thick

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
insoluble in yogurt and becomes thick

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
insoluble in yogurt and becomes thick
it's<00:00:45.300> because<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.309> acidic<00:00:47.309> pH<00:00:48.260> let's<00:00:49.260> first

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's because of acidic pH let's first

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.850 
it's because of acidic pH let's first
check<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> pH<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.480> two<00:00:51.719> food<00:00:51.930> items<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
check the pH of these two food items the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
check the pH of these two food items the
green<00:00:56.129> color<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> pH<00:00:57.120> paper<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.660> milk

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
indicates milk is neutral pH about 7 and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.590 
indicates milk is neutral pH about 7 and
the<00:01:03.539> orange<00:01:04.339> color<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.790> pH<00:01:06.090> paper<00:01:06.299> in
