Pokemon that do better however it is
very<00:00:16.139> interesting<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.279> stronger

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
very interesting because it is stronger

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
very interesting because it is stronger
than<00:00:18.600> Pidgeot<00:00:19.050> base<00:00:19.230> stat<00:00:19.500> wise<00:00:19.650> sure<00:00:20.340> it's

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
than Pidgeot base stat wise sure it's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
than Pidgeot base stat wise sure it's
hit<00:00:20.699> points<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.119> defenses<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.660> lower<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
hit points and defenses are lower but

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.779 
hit points and defenses are lower but
inferior<00:00:22.830> doesn't<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> special<00:00:23.550> attack

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
inferior doesn't use a special attack

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
inferior doesn't use a special attack
anyway<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.630> looking<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> offense<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
anyway but looking at the offense you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
anyway but looking at the offense you
get<00:00:25.590> 10<00:00:25.830> more<00:00:26.010> points<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.400> offense<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:27.269> one

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
get 10 more points in offense for one

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
get 10 more points in offense for one
less<00:00:27.810> point<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> speed<00:00:28.410> against<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> Pidgeot

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
less point and speed against the Pidgeot

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
less point and speed against the Pidgeot
that's<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:30.080> kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.140> crazy<00:00:31.380> right

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that's actually kind of crazy right

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
that's actually kind of crazy right
there<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.210> look<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.780> like

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there so when you look at that it's like

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
there so when you look at that it's like
well<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> could<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.530> stronger<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.190> let's<00:00:35.700> also

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
well it could be stronger so let's also

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
well it could be stronger so let's also
go<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.450> its<00:00:36.570> typing<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.469> Pidgeot<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
go look at its typing like Pidgeot it is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060 
go look at its typing like Pidgeot it is
a<00:00:38.670> normal<00:00:39.420> Flying<00:00:39.750> type<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.620> means<00:00:40.829> you're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
a normal Flying type which means you're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
a normal Flying type which means you're
not<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.180> getting<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.660> benefits<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
not really getting the benefits of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.959 
not really getting the benefits of
having<00:00:43.290> normal<00:00:43.770> stab<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.700> getting

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
having normal stab but you are getting

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
having normal stab but you are getting
the<00:00:45.059> benefits<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.719> you're<00:00:46.230> super

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the benefits and that you're super

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
the benefits and that you're super
effective<00:00:46.980> hit<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.520> fighting<00:00:47.910> becomes

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
effective hit from fighting becomes

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.930 
effective hit from fighting becomes
neutral<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:49.860> gain<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> resistance<00:00:50.789> or

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
neutral and you now gain a resistance or

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.540 
neutral and you now gain a resistance or
an<00:00:51.210> immunity<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.350> ground<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.250> okay

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
an immunity to ground which is okay

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.750 
an immunity to ground which is okay
you're<00:00:53.760> still<00:00:53.969> weak<00:00:54.149> against<00:00:54.480> rock<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
you're still weak against rock I and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
you're still weak against rock I and
electric<00:00:56.760> though<00:00:56.969> which<00:00:57.449> isn't<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
electric though which isn't good and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
electric though which isn't good and
your<00:00:58.320> strengths<00:00:58.800> against<00:00:59.129> grass<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> bug

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
your strengths against grass and bug

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.299 
your strengths against grass and bug
aren't<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> best<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:02.010> we're<00:01:02.190> gonna

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
aren't really the best so we're gonna

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.920 
aren't really the best so we're gonna
make<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.270> quick<00:01:03.480> hop<00:01:03.719> into

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
make this one really quick hop into

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
make this one really quick hop into
Pokemon<00:01:04.260> showdown<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.010> look<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.330> something

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
Pokemon showdown and look at something

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.390 
Pokemon showdown and look at something
that's<00:01:07.049> rather<00:01:07.380> underwhelming<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> do

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that's rather underwhelming so you do

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's rather underwhelming so you do
have<00:01:08.430> keen<00:01:08.760> eye<00:01:08.880> ability<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.510> means

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have keen eye ability which means

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
have keen eye ability which means
they're<00:01:10.350> using<00:01:10.650> evasion<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.310> still<00:01:11.520> hit

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
they're using evasion you can still hit

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.710 
they're using evasion you can still hit
them<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> only<00:01:12.540> thing

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
them but that's about the only thing

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
them but that's about the only thing
going<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.200> Bureau<00:01:13.380> though<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.880> theory<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
going in Bureau though in theory I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.410 
going in Bureau though in theory I
losted<00:01:15.659> fear<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> thorn<00:01:16.430> fearo's<00:01:17.430> favor<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
losted fear of thorn fearo's favor is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
losted fear of thorn fearo's favor is
that<00:01:18.900> drill<00:01:19.680> rar<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> drill<00:01:20.729> peck<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that drill rar is that drill peck is the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.760 
that drill rar is that drill peck is the
strongest<00:01:21.780> flying-type<00:01:22.140> move<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> gets

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
strongest flying-type move it gets

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.940 
strongest flying-type move it gets
because<00:01:23.369> no<00:01:24.360> brave<00:01:24.659> bird<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.439> also<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.740> sky

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
because no brave bird it also has sky

because no brave bird it also has sky
attack<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> fly<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.850> those<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.210> really

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
attack and fly but those are some really

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.780 
attack and fly but those are some really
tricky<00:01:27.630> moves<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.640> have

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
you feel I don't think sky attack power
herb<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.409> great<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> combo<00:01:41.390> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
herb is that great of a combo it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
herb is that great of a combo it's
really<00:01:42.960> tricky<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> make<00:01:43.649> Ferro<00:01:44.100> work<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
really tricky to make Ferro work like I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
really tricky to make Ferro work like I
could<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.509> only<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:45.990> gimmick<00:01:46.229> being

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
could see the only good gimmick being

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
could see the only good gimmick being
sniper<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.790> sky<00:01:48.149> attack<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> time

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
sniper with sky attack and then the time

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
sniper with sky attack and then the time
passing<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> focus<00:01:49.950> energy<00:01:50.360> something<00:01:51.360> like

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
passing a focus energy something like

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
passing a focus energy something like
that<00:01:51.810> other<00:01:52.409> than<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.130> stick

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that other than that you can just stick

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.600 
that other than that you can just stick
to<00:01:53.520> fly<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> drill<00:01:54.630> run<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.799> seeing<00:01:56.250> too<00:01:56.399> much

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
to fly and drill run I'm seeing too much

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
to fly and drill run I'm seeing too much
wrong<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.969> fly<00:01:57.210> fly<00:01:57.960> works<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.560> gives

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
wrong with fly fly works it just gives

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.709 
wrong with fly fly works it just gives
you<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.829> extra<00:01:58.920> damage<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.060> accuracy<00:02:00.509> could

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you that extra damage the accuracy could

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.600 
you that extra damage the accuracy could
be<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> problem<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.950> else<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.399> do

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
be a problem but what else can you do

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
frail Pokemon it's going to be really

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390 
frail Pokemon it's going to be really
hard<00:02:21.969> to<00:02:22.090> sell<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.569> ko<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:24.280> what

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
hard to sell that ko so that's what

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.530 
hard to sell that ko so that's what
we're<00:02:24.519> dealing<00:02:24.640> with<00:02:24.819> we<00:02:25.030> also<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.269> steel

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
we're dealing with we also have steel

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.089 
we're dealing with we also have steel
wing<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:25.959> coverage<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.560> drill<00:02:26.890> run

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
wing for coverage we have drill run

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.470 
wing for coverage we have drill run
which<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.430> nice<00:02:27.640> because<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:27.939> adds<00:02:28.299> that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
which is nice because it adds that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
which is nice because it adds that
ground<00:02:28.750> coverage<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.709> that's<00:02:30.189> at<00:02:30.340> least

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
ground coverage and that's at least

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.679 
ground coverage and that's at least
something<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> Pharaohs<00:02:31.420> favor

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
something going in the Pharaohs favor

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.959 
something going in the Pharaohs favor
then<00:02:32.170> we<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.409> return<00:02:32.799> we<00:02:33.370> also<00:02:33.519> have<00:02:33.730> me

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
then we have return we also have me

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.069 
then we have return we also have me
remove<00:02:34.209> because<00:02:34.450> using<00:02:34.810> your<00:02:35.019> opponent's

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
remove because using your opponent's

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.899 
remove because using your opponent's
move<00:02:35.469> against<00:02:35.829> you<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.219> just<00:02:36.280> kind<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.760> love

move against you I just kind of love
that<00:02:36.939> idea<00:02:37.269> with<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:38.200> Pokemon<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.709> can<00:02:38.769> use

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
that idea with the Pokemon that can use

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.190 
that idea with the Pokemon that can use
it<00:02:39.219> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.790> go<00:02:40.060> choice<00:02:40.299> band<00:02:40.689> you<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.049> also

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it you can go choice band you can also

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.679 
it you can go choice band you can also
go<00:02:41.379> choice<00:02:41.620> scarf<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:43.030> really<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.599> really

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
go choice scarf it's really it's really

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.559 
go choice scarf it's really it's really
hard<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.200> make<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.379> work<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:44.709> because<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
hard to make it work here because and

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.509 
hard to make it work here because and
the<00:02:46.810> stats<00:02:47.109> they<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.769> they<00:02:48.069> just<00:02:48.099> don't

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the stats they just they just don't

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.990 
the stats they just they just don't
really<00:02:48.790> line<00:02:49.659> up<00:02:49.689> too<00:02:50.109> well<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.159> fearow

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
really line up too well so fearow

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.119 
really line up too well so fearow
probably<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.079> Pokemon<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.829> can<00:02:53.980> use

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
probably not a Pokemon that you can use

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.679 
probably not a Pokemon that you can use
probably<00:02:54.519> not<00:02:54.639> Pokemon<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.180> can<00:02:55.329> get<00:02:55.480> much

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
probably not Pokemon I can get much

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.229 
probably not Pokemon I can get much
competitive<00:02:56.200> play<00:02:56.409> keep<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.730> its<00:02:58.060> own

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
competitive play keep it in its own

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.300 
competitive play keep it in its own
little<00:02:58.419> tearing<00:02:59.109> systems<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.769> don't<00:03:00.069> even

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
little tearing systems that I don't even

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.119 
little tearing systems that I don't even
know<00:03:00.430> what<00:03:00.609> tier<00:03:00.969> it<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.209> uh<00:03:01.349> if<00:03:02.349> we<00:03:02.530> head<00:03:03.099> back

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
know what tier it is uh if we head back

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.339 
know what tier it is uh if we head back
out<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.090> here<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.359> think<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.750> would<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:05.019> go<00:03:05.139> new

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
out of here I think it would just go new

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.349 
out of here I think it would just go new
team<00:03:05.590> at<00:03:05.889> Pokemon<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.939> would<00:03:07.060> give<00:03:07.150> us<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
team at Pokemon it would give us the

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.199 
team at Pokemon it would give us the
tier<00:03:07.599> it's<00:03:08.290> probably<00:03:08.680> something<00:03:09.010> super<00:03:09.939> and

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
tier it's probably something super and

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.360 
tier it's probably something super and
like<00:03:10.389> never<00:03:10.750> used<00:03:11.379> or<00:03:12.329> something

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
like never used or something

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.309 
like never used or something
if<00:03:15.370> yeah<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.209> probably<00:03:16.359> somewhere<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.019> here

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
if yeah it's probably somewhere in here

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.619 
if yeah it's probably somewhere in here
that<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.829> know<00:03:17.949> it<00:03:18.609> doesn't<00:03:18.849> see<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> lot<00:03:19.510> of

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
that you know it doesn't see a lot of

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.020 
that you know it doesn't see a lot of
play<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.829> then<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.190> have<00:03:21.280> not<00:03:21.400> fully<00:03:21.609> hope<00:03:21.849> so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
play and then we have not fully hope so

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.149 
play and then we have not fully hope so
if<00:03:22.479> this<00:03:23.049> Pokemon<00:03:23.470> might<00:03:23.650> get<00:03:23.799> some<00:03:23.979> play

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
if this Pokemon might get some play

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.280 
if this Pokemon might get some play
inside<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:24.699> that<00:03:24.849> but<00:03:25.209> even<00:03:25.419> then<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.109> just

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
inside of that but even then it just

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.469 
inside of that but even then it just
doesn't<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.949> has<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.400> stats<00:03:27.699> to<00:03:28.060> be<00:03:28.209> useful

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
doesn't it has the stats to be useful

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.750

but<00:03:29.199> just<00:03:29.439> does<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.799> have<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.220> moves<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.639> make

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760

it<00:03:30.909> strong<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.449> that's<00:03:31.750> where<00:03:31.989> Pidgeot<00:03:32.319> does

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it strong and that's where Pidgeot does
