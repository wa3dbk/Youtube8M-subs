00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
Vermont they knew that they were going

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160 
Vermont they knew that they were going
to<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.400> pro<00:01:37.730> competition<00:01:38.360> if<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:38.600> won<00:01:38.840> so

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
to a pro competition if they won so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630 
to a pro competition if they won so
people<00:01:39.590> were<00:01:39.650> definitely<00:01:39.980> trying<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.310> take<00:01:40.490> it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
people were definitely trying to take it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.620 
people were definitely trying to take it
full<00:01:40.790> advantage<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:43.330> they<00:01:44.330> were<00:01:44.390> all

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
full advantage of that they were all

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.100 
full advantage of that they were all
throwing<00:01:44.990> great<00:01:45.800> great<00:01:46.250> runs<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.750> only<00:01:47.930> thing

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
throwing great great runs the only thing

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.960 
throwing great great runs the only thing
that<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.470> think<00:01:48.650> was<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.310> matter<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
that I think was the matter and the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.000 
that I think was the matter and the
difference<00:01:50.360> would<00:01:50.600> be<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.020> cleanliness<00:01:51.860> of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
difference would be the cleanliness of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.250 
difference would be the cleanliness of
the<00:01:52.490> runs<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.910> know<00:01:53.090> like<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:54.050> had<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
the runs you know like and you had to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.750 
the runs you know like and you had to
make<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.530> smooth<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:54.980> take<00:01:55.130> home<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.430> gold<00:01:55.640> and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
make it smooth to take home the gold and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.750 
make it smooth to take home the gold and
that's<00:01:55.970> what<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.150> was<00:01:56.240> trying<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.480> do<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.380> did

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
that's what I was trying to do you did

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.210 
that's what I was trying to do you did
go<00:01:58.760> for<00:01:59.000> that
