Sports Personality thing this girl I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
Sports Personality thing this girl I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
guess she allegedly knew CM Punk for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
guess she allegedly knew CM Punk for
years<00:01:02.850> long<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.149> AJ<00:01:03.809> Lee's<00:01:03.989> relationship

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

with CM Punk and then one thing led to
another<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.780> guess<00:01:06.930> maybe<00:01:07.110> AJ<00:01:07.439> Lee<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.680> a

another and I guess maybe AJ Lee got a
little<00:01:07.920> flustered<00:01:08.100> maybe<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.729> jealous

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that she was talking to CM Punk and she
