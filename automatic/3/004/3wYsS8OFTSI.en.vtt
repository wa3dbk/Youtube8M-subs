that<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> main<00:00:26.010> main<00:00:26.580> point<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
that the main main point is that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.900 
that the main main point is that
everything<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.680> well-rounded<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.730> was

really<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.599> easy<00:00:30.900> choice<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:32.189> just

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
really a very easy choice I can just

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
really a very easy choice I can just
sort<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> branch<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> explore<00:00:33.840> something

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
sort of branch out and explore something

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020
