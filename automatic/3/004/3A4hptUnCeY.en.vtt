spread out a good good advice for team
deathmatches<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.090> mainly<00:02:22.450> see<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.660> cluster<00:02:23.020> of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
deathmatches you mainly see a cluster of

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.130 
deathmatches you mainly see a cluster of
green<00:02:23.680> arrows<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.630> team<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
green arrows and that's your team and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830 
green arrows and that's your team and
the<00:02:27.100> other<00:02:27.130> team<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.820> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> spawn<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the other team is going to spawn on the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.740 
the other team is going to spawn on the
completely<00:02:29.230> opposite<00:02:29.770> side<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.750> team

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
completely opposite side and team

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.420 
completely opposite side and team
deathmatch<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.650> kind<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.950> tricky<00:02:33.010> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
deathmatch can be kind of tricky because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
deathmatch can be kind of tricky because
the<00:02:33.610> spawns<00:02:33.970> are<00:02:34.120> constantly<00:02:34.540> changing<00:02:35.310> but

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the spawns are constantly changing but

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.120 
the spawns are constantly changing but
with<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:39.190> perseverance<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:41.260> time<00:02:41.650> you

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
with with perseverance and in time you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.160 
with with perseverance and in time you
can<00:02:42.310> master<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.060> art<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.810> spawn

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
can master the art that is spawn

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.410 
can master the art that is spawn
trapping<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.710> team<00:02:44.920> deathmatch<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:49.240> yeah

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
trapping in team deathmatch and so yeah

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.800 
trapping in team deathmatch and so yeah
I<00:02:51.870> get<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> Harrier<00:02:53.320> here<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.600> turns<00:02:55.600> out

the best idea all the time the best idea

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.490 
the best idea all the time the best idea
is<00:04:02.710> always<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.580> fire<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.510> first<00:04:04.780> one<00:04:05.050> switch

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
is always to fire the first one switch

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.740 
is always to fire the first one switch
the<00:04:05.680> second<00:04:05.980> one<00:04:06.130> fire<00:04:06.370> all<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.180> you

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the second one fire all of it and you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.270 
the second one fire all of it and you
kind<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:07.990> want<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.230> be<00:04:08.320> spastic<00:04:08.830> with<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.130> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
kind of want to be spastic with it you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.310 
kind of want to be spastic with it you
want<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.550> look<00:04:10.360> everywhere<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.080> fire

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
want to look everywhere and fire

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.860 
want to look everywhere and fire
everywhere<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.190> with<00:04:12.730> 3rd<00:04:13.000> Canada<00:04:13.450> can<00:04:13.720> be

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
everywhere and with 3rd Canada can be

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.300 
everywhere and with 3rd Canada can be
kind<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.140> tricky<00:04:14.200> because<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.830> bullets<00:04:15.220> are

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
kind of tricky because the bullets are

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.260 
kind of tricky because the bullets are
so<00:04:15.490> small<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.900> they're<00:04:17.080> running<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:19.120> main

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
so small but if they're running the main

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.030 
so small but if they're running the main
idea<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.780> how<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:19.960> hit<00:04:20.229> them<00:04:20.350> has<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:20.770> hit

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
idea of how you hit them has just hit

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.250 
idea of how you hit them has just hit
about<00:04:21.310> maybe<00:04:21.790> 15<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.360> 20<00:04:22.660> feet<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:22.990> front<00:04:23.020> of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
about maybe 15 to 20 feet in front of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.200 
about maybe 15 to 20 feet in front of
them<00:04:23.350> and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
them and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.399 
them and
you're<00:04:25.210> gonna<00:04:25.330> get<00:04:25.509> yourself<00:04:25.719> a<00:04:26.050> nice<00:04:26.169> little

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
you're gonna get yourself a nice little

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:33.269 
you're gonna get yourself a nice little
kill<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:30.090> yeah<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.629> suggest<00:04:32.289> kind<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.919> laying

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:33.279 
kill and yeah I I suggest kind of laying

kill and yeah I I suggest kind of laying
off<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.669> chopper<00:04:33.999> gunner<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.479> kind<00:04:34.659> of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
off the chopper gunner if you kind of
