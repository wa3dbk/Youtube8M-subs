00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:16.180
 and I know already I know if this is the first 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.910
 living this outfit as you can see 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.769
 I'm wearing a blouse this is slabs of 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.539
 dance is blue I think that usa 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.339
 It was very fashionable for summer because 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.050
 apart from being super cool you can 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.150
 use with a top in as the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.069
 studies in May and you can also 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.810
 use both day and night as 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.030
 You can see the blouse in the back 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.410
 it's a little bit longer and you can 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.240
 use with laws if you do not want 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.860
 use it with shorts 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.860
 the state 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 and in the bottom part if using a 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.780
 short these deaf of the mark 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 aeropostal and also summer is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.989
 perfect to use these types of short 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.489
 and you can use them in any color and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.280
 especially the white that for me is a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.200
 basic for the sandals I'm wearing 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.150
 these freights that are black and I think that 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.370
 they have already seen it in a previous leaflet and 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.800
 they are black and they have like this kind of 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.900
 You strike something like that and I think they're super 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 pretty if some flags are also basic 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.369
 for summer for accessories I'm 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.020
 using these bracelets here that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.640
 we did in a previous video so I'm going 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.619
 to leave the link below in case you want them 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.619
 do and in addition to this golden watch 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.050
 the second is this super casual dress 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 super simple is a promo color this 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.110
 time and it's very simple and it's also cool 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 for the summer that you can also 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.289
 add a correct one in the part of the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.710
 waist to accentuate what if that 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.710
 you want 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.020
 and see the sandals we use others 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 These cloud's flatts are from Steve Martin and 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.619
 I love the touch of color that has 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 because it gives life to sandals 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:56.390
 and obviously in summer some glasses 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 sun and these are from benetton and the third 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.740
 and where I'm incorporating the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.360
 floral print although it makes you a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.460
 little bit bigger if you do not use the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.070
 flower print in summer and this is 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.910
 a black blouse with little flowers 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.310
 brand 1550 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.900
 the sun is an American sun in a tone 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.410
 clearer so there's contrast with 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.410
 our blues 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.069
 and although I do not like to wear shoes in 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.909
 summer I think that for any time of 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.260
 year 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.260
 as well as that more sporty and casual 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.920
 skin 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.870
 Actions 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.400
 ah
