00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.620
 to avoid a new episode of nf where 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.809
 we discovered there in the movies 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 today I'm leaving to do it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.920
 a storyboard does not need to be a headline 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.780
 but if you give the idea in your head of the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.730
 you want to see on the screen and transfer it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 on the paper I have here sincerely to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.529
 draw the amount of paper I 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.529
 I'll need 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.470
 I 'm only going to make a senora today. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 although more or less some three roles 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 each picture represents what you are going 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 see on screen 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 you can use any type of drawing 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 to show your team or you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 even remember why you want it on your 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 movie on your video in my scene I 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:56.910
 I want to start with the camera very low 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.770
 moving through the grass on a sunny color one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.309
 tall grass 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.030
 so I 'm going to draw the landscape I 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.229
 I want to stay in the camera and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.689
 write down what's going on 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 do not be afraid to pass the lines of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.979
 painting 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.570
 this will just show what's around 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.570
 of what you are creating 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.450
 the historian also known as 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.590
 sequential sketching can prevent errors or 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.150
 help solve problems culture 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 it is widely used to share 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.390
 ideas about future 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 most effective preview movie 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.810
 storyboards are so popular in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 hollywood there are even artists 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.479
 for sequential sketches 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.260
 besides being excellent designers 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.320
 they also have a sense of perspective 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.610
 Wide-angle camera lens size at 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 any other information that the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.600
 director may want to share to 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.030
 to create a quality storyboard 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.530
 for more information about format or 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 examples access our facebook 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.440
 now back to the drawing I already have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 finished my background 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:26.550
 the midplane with the school in front of 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.120
 sun the sunset at the front with the flowers 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.190
 en up I decided to use the two format 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 number of frames per page in order to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.200
 maximum of details per frame 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 As you can see here I want 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.420
 the camera is directly in front of you 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.560
 in the sun to be able to have rays of sun 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.560
 entering the lens 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680
 already in the second frame the camera is 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.230
 back to the sun burning a young woman 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.230
 girl in the middle of a field of flowers 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.160
 so here are my twelve pictures in 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:12.770
 numerical order each with a description 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.160
 with motion details do not be afraid 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.990
 to use certain arrows 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.450
 are used to indicate the 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.020
 movement of the actors and the most 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.000
 thin to indicate the moment the camera I 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.670
 said before that storyboard can prevent 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.280
 errors now viewing image number 9 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.280
 Can I realize that I do not want to be? 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.440
 exactly this angle in this 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.200
 proximity to an actor because I do not want 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.090
 create a new character then being 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.880
 farther and leaving your face in the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.220
 might indicate to the public 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.910
 that it is not so important for the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.010
 story 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.510
