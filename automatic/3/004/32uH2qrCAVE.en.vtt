00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the side pocket it's a two-way shot

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
the side pocket it's a two-way shot
because<00:00:19.020> if<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.260> miss<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.490> come<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
because if we miss this we come up a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
because if we miss this we come up a

head back down table and hopefully end
up<00:00:25.410> close<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> its<00:00:25.949> original<00:00:26.010> position<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:27.170> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
up close to its original position and a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
up close to its original position and a
cue<00:00:28.349> ball<00:00:28.380> meanwhile<00:00:29.099> we'll<00:00:29.550> go<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.910> two

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cue ball meanwhile we'll go one two

three rails and end up far away from the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.420 
three rails and end up far away from the
eight<00:00:33.989> ball<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.980> might<00:00:35.130> leave<00:00:35.250> our

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
eight ball so we might leave our

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.750 
eight ball so we might leave our
opponent<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.969> even<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.360> difficult<00:00:36.780> shot<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
opponent and even more difficult shot a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.799 
opponent and even more difficult shot a
little<00:00:38.760> write<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.149> English<00:00:39.360> helps<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
little write in English helps get the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:50.490 
little write in English helps get the
cue<00:00:39.989> ball<00:00:40.110> around<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> table

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.610 

all<00:00:51.070> right<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:51.340> I<00:00:51.370> missed<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.730> shot<00:00:52.620> didn't

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
all right so I missed that shot didn't

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.590 
all right so I missed that shot didn't
cut<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.920> eight-ball<00:00:54.190> enough<00:00:54.400> we<00:00:55.330> create<00:00:55.570> a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
cut the eight-ball enough we create a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.240 
cut the eight-ball enough we create a
good<00:00:55.750> separation<00:00:55.930> but<00:00:56.530> we<00:00:56.680> still<00:00:56.920> have<00:00:57.100> to

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
good separation but we still have to

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.330 
good separation but we still have to
feel<00:00:57.400> an<00:00:57.520> easy<00:00:57.640> shot<00:00:57.880> for<00:00:57.940> our<00:00:58.210> opponent

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
feel an easy shot for our opponent

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.950 
feel an easy shot for our opponent
ideally<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.430> 8-ball<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.820> come<00:01:01.030> back<00:01:01.660> close<00:01:01.930> to

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
ideally the 8-ball to come back close to

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.990 
ideally the 8-ball to come back close to
original<00:01:02.170> position<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.760> have<00:01:03.880> good

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
original position and we have good

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.520 
original position and we have good
separation<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.870> tough<00:01:05.080> shot<00:01:05.260> for<00:01:05.500> our

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
separation and a tough shot for our

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
separation and a tough shot for our
phone<00:01:05.770> let's<00:01:06.610> try<00:01:06.820> again

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.250 

much<00:01:13.810> better

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.200 

again<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.380> right<00:01:17.530> English<00:01:17.850> helps<00:01:18.850> throw<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
again the right English helps throw the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.780 
again the right English helps throw the
eight<00:01:19.330> ball<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.010> desired<00:01:21.010> path<00:01:21.280> better

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
eight ball in the desired path better

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.560 
eight ball in the desired path better
it<00:01:22.270> also<00:01:22.420> helps<00:01:22.869> bring<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.380> cue<00:01:23.680> ball<00:01:23.830> around

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it also helps bring the cue ball around

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.480 
it also helps bring the cue ball around
towards<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.630> center<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.050> headrail<00:01:26.490> let's

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
towards the center of the headrail let's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.790 
towards the center of the headrail let's
try<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.760> more<00:01:28.060> write<00:01:28.270> English

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.350 

that's<00:01:35.800> more<00:01:36.009> likely<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> little<00:01:40.240> more

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
that's more likely and a little more

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.300 
that's more likely and a little more
speed<00:01:40.600> down<00:01:40.810> even<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.229> shot<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.190> eight

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
speed down even on that shot the eight

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.710 
speed down even on that shot the eight
ball<00:01:42.460> had<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> lot<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:43.000> speed<00:01:43.180> coming<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
ball had a lot of speed coming to the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.050 
ball had a lot of speed coming to the
side<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.740> cue<00:01:44.890> ball<00:01:45.070> came<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.640> little<00:01:45.940> bit

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
side and the cue ball came a little bit

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.670 
side and the cue ball came a little bit
too<00:01:46.240> far<00:01:46.450> off<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.750> headrail<00:01:47.020> but<00:01:47.290> we<00:01:47.380> left<00:01:47.560> at

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
too far off to headrail but we left at

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.880 
too far off to headrail but we left at
the<00:01:47.770> sin<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.100> table<00:01:48.400> which<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.640> good<00:01:49.890> let's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the sin of the table which is good let's

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.960 
the sin of the table which is good let's
try<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.100> one<00:01:51.190> more<00:01:51.250> time<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.780> better

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
try it one more time that's better

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.690 
try it one more time that's better
that's<00:01:57.970> beautiful<00:01:59.250> let<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.370> cue<00:02:00.520> ball<00:02:00.670> right

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
that's beautiful let the cue ball right

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.330 
that's beautiful let the cue ball right
the<00:02:01.090> headrail<00:02:01.390> if<00:02:01.540> we<00:02:01.659> had<00:02:01.780> missed<00:02:02.190> we<00:02:03.190> had

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
the headrail if we had missed we had

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.649 
the headrail if we had missed we had
missed<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> little<00:02:03.610> long<00:02:03.880> eight<00:02:04.240> ball<00:02:04.540> would

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
missed a little long eight ball would

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
our pull in a very tough shot so that's

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.239 
our pull in a very tough shot so that's
a<00:02:11.380> good<00:02:11.560> offensive<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:12.519> two-way<00:02:13.000> shot
