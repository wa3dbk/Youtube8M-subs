00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
what brought me to the class was the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.240 
what brought me to the class was the
interaction<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:48.180> Feldenkrais<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.539> dance

off<00:00:57.370> of<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.730> ground<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.680> feel<00:00:59.680> as<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.160> do

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
off of the ground and feel as you do

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.350 
off of the ground and feel as you do
that<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.989> do<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.350> do<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:03.699> trouble<00:01:04.239> with

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
that how do you do that the trouble with

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.270 
that how do you do that the trouble with
a<00:01:04.390> lot<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.629> our<00:01:04.840> movement<00:01:05.260> these<00:01:05.379> days<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:06.040> that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
a lot of our movement these days is that

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.690 
a lot of our movement these days is that
we<00:01:06.760> don't<00:01:06.880> even<00:01:07.090> know<00:01:07.330> how<00:01:07.600> we<00:01:07.660> move<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.130> until

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
we don't even know how we move so until

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700 
we don't even know how we move so until
you<00:01:09.850> actually<00:01:10.240> know<00:01:10.360> how<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.720> move<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.410> can't

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
you actually know how you move you can't

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.980 
you actually know how you move you can't
change<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.310> or<00:01:12.490> improve<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:13.030> how<00:01:13.720> can<00:01:13.780> you

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
change it or improve it how can you

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.320 
change it or improve it how can you
transfer<00:01:14.620> your<00:01:14.650> weight<00:01:14.980> so<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:16.030> leg

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
transfer your weight so that that leg

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
transfer your weight so that that leg
that<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.720> lift<00:01:17.050> is<00:01:17.320> like<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:17.980> feather<00:01:18.430> my

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that you lift is like a feather my

method

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.930 
method
how<00:01:26.110> would<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.530> transfer<00:01:27.220> your<00:01:27.250> weight<00:01:27.640> and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
how would you transfer your weight and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.020 
how would you transfer your weight and
lift<00:01:28.720> one<00:01:28.960> leg<00:01:28.990> from<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.590> position<00:01:29.830> we<00:01:30.790> use

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
lift one leg from this position we use

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.650 
lift one leg from this position we use
the<00:01:31.300> floor<00:01:31.690> as<00:01:31.960> our<00:01:32.110> lab<00:01:32.380> it's<00:01:33.340> kind<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.090> the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
the floor as our lab it's kind of the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590 
the floor as our lab it's kind of the
place<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.200> which<00:01:35.230> we<00:01:35.400> start<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.550> sense<00:01:36.880> how<00:01:37.360> our

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
place in which we start to sense how our

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.390 
place in which we start to sense how our
bodyweight<00:01:38.080> interacts<00:01:39.010> with<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
bodyweight interacts with the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.810 
bodyweight interacts with the
environment<00:01:40.170> Feldenkrais<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> very

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
environment Feldenkrais is a very

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.670 
environment Feldenkrais is a very
internal<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.090> quiet<00:01:43.480> way<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:43.990> investigate

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
internal and quiet way to investigate

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.520 
internal and quiet way to investigate
our<00:01:44.710> movements

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
our movements

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.980 
our movements
and<00:01:45.620> it's<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.130> great<00:01:46.340> way<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.550> learn<00:01:46.990> pathways

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
and it's a great way to learn pathways

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.710 
and it's a great way to learn pathways
to<00:01:48.200> more<00:01:48.410> efficient<00:01:48.800> movement<00:01:48.950> dance<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.480> is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
to more efficient movement dance then is

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.050 
to more efficient movement dance then is
a<00:01:50.750> practice<00:01:51.650> where<00:01:52.100> we<00:01:52.160> get<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.640> interact<00:01:52.670> with

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
a practice where we get to interact with

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.570 
a practice where we get to interact with
others<00:01:53.950> there's<00:01:54.950> something<00:01:55.310> about<00:01:55.520> being

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
others there's something about being

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.010 
others there's something about being
with<00:01:55.970> other<00:01:56.090> people<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.540> get<00:01:56.690> something

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
with other people that get something

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
with other people that get something
more<00:01:57.170> out<00:01:57.230> of<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.680> when<00:01:58.370> he<00:01:58.400> goes<00:01:58.730> down<00:01:58.760> I<00:02:00.970> come

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
more out of you when he goes down I come

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
more out of you when he goes down I come
up<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.450> now<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.750> walk<00:02:03.670> yeah<00:02:04.670> my<00:02:05.480> role<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.840> this

up and now I walk yeah my role in this
class<00:02:06.260> was<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.860> bring<00:02:07.100> dance<00:02:08.619> into<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.649> space

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
class was to bring dance into the space

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.650 
class was to bring dance into the space
and<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.670> five<00:02:11.570> letter<00:02:11.900> word<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.860> means

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and in that five letter word it means

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.140 
and in that five letter word it means
movement<00:02:14.660> through<00:02:15.320> space<00:02:15.350> up<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.460> down<00:02:16.610> with

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
movement through space up and down with

the second day everyone including myself
seemed<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> be<00:02:58.209> free<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.450> inhibitions<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.500> I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
seemed to be free of inhibitions and I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.440 
seemed to be free of inhibitions and I
personally<00:03:01.820> found<00:03:02.120> myself<00:03:02.420> lost<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
personally found myself lost in the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.550 
personally found myself lost in the
movements<00:03:05.450> in

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
movements in

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.910 
movements in
had<00:03:07.040> not<00:03:07.220> expected<00:03:08.110> what<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.140> took<00:03:09.650> away<00:03:09.709> from

than I think I can if I sort of just

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.470 
than I think I can if I sort of just
relax<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.319> trust<00:03:18.319> my<00:03:18.980> body<00:03:19.250> I'm<00:03:20.209> not<00:03:20.450> a
