hi I wanted to talk a little bit today
about<00:00:03.500> the<00:00:04.500> breast<00:00:04.740> pump<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.279> use<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.910> am<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
about the breast pump that I use I am a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.060 
about the breast pump that I use I am a
working<00:00:07.200> mother<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.940> twin<00:00:08.940> daughters<00:00:09.240> who<00:00:09.840> are

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
working mother to twin daughters who are

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.870 
working mother to twin daughters who are
16<00:00:11.070> months<00:00:11.429> old<00:00:11.580> at<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> moment<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.950> I<00:00:13.950> put<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
16 months old at the moment and I put a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.929 
16 months old at the moment and I put a
pump<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:16.470> work<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.900> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.740> five<00:00:20.609> ounce

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
pump at work and this is a five ounce

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.620 
pump at work and this is a five ounce
container<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.430> if<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.550> pump<00:00:23.820> twice<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.420> could

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
container and if I pump twice I could

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.349 
container and if I pump twice I could
get<00:00:24.810> probably<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.560> 10<00:00:26.250> ounces<00:00:26.789> using<00:00:27.240> this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
get probably about 10 ounces using this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
get probably about 10 ounces using this
pump<00:00:28.130> every<00:00:29.130> day<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.830> it's<00:00:31.830> been<00:00:32.099> working

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pump every day so it's been working

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
pump every day so it's been working
really<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.940> me<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.750> easy<00:00:34.500> it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
really well for me it's easy it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
really well for me it's easy it's
portable<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.960> very<00:00:37.340> lightweight<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
portable and very lightweight so I just

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.280 
portable and very lightweight so I just
wanted<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> show<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.680> exactly<00:00:41.570> how<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
wanted to show you exactly how I do it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.069 
wanted to show you exactly how I do it
and<00:00:44.210> maybe<00:00:45.210> it'll<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.780> little<00:00:45.899> bit

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and maybe it'll make it a little bit

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.170 
and maybe it'll make it a little bit
easier<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.550> terms<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.969> thinking

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
easier for you and in terms of thinking

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
easier for you and in terms of thinking
about<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.870> how<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> work

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
about you know how you can make it work

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
about you know how you can make it work
for<00:00:50.700> yourself<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.719> always

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
for yourself so what I do is I always

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.900 
for yourself so what I do is I always
have<00:00:54.960> an<00:00:55.199> EZ<00:00:56.480> shirt<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:59.870> open<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
have an EZ shirt that I can open and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.700 
have an EZ shirt that I can open and
I've<00:01:02.910> removed<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.660> rest<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.610> nipple

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I've removed the rest put the nipple

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
I've removed the rest put the nipple
like<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.080> hop<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:11.130> takes<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.700> minute<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.119> two

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
like so and hop it takes a minute or two

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
like so and hop it takes a minute or two
or<00:01:12.510> actually<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.049> even<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.290> minute<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.619> takes<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
or actually not even a minute it takes a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
or actually not even a minute it takes a
few<00:01:14.100> seconds<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> milk<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.020> actually

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
few seconds for the milk to actually

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
few seconds for the milk to actually
come<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.770> large<00:01:19.770> quantities<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:20.939> now

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
come and large quantities so right now

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
come and large quantities so right now
it's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's just a little bit at a time as I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's just a little bit at a time as I
pump<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.320> gets<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.939> within<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
pump but as it gets going within a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
pump but as it gets going within a
minute<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:31.079> should<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:31.979> filling<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
minute or so I should start filling it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200 
minute or so I should start filling it
up<00:01:32.549> pretty<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.880> stimulate<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
up pretty good so I just stimulate the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.000 
up pretty good so I just stimulate the
milk<00:01:36.450> flow<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:37.490> continuously<00:01:38.490> pumping

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
milk flow by continuously pumping

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.970 
milk flow by continuously pumping
and<00:01:40.640> sometimes<00:01:41.120> if<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.420> press<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:42.080> too<00:01:42.650> hard

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
and sometimes if you press in too hard

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.870 
and sometimes if you press in too hard
then<00:01:44.080> for<00:01:45.080> some<00:01:45.230> reason<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.770> seems<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.370> inhibit

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
then for some reason it seems to inhibit

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.000 
then for some reason it seems to inhibit
flow<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.050> want<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.320> make<00:01:48.470> sure<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:48.860> you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
flow so you want to make sure that you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.960 
flow so you want to make sure that you
don't<00:01:50.590> constrict<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.010> memories<00:01:52.490> or<00:01:52.700> whatever

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
don't constrict the memories or whatever

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.290 
don't constrict the memories or whatever
it<00:01:53.120> is<00:01:53.240> that's<00:01:53.420> happening<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.950> just

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
it is that's happening and you just

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.000 
it is that's happening and you just
continue<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.660> pump<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.260> make<00:01:57.470> sure<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
continue to pump and make sure that the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.230 
continue to pump and make sure that the
nipple<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.370> get<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.730> right<00:01:58.940> size<00:01:59.300> for<00:01:59.860> your

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
nipple you get the right size for your

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:10.180 
nipple you get the right size for your
nipple<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.660> fit<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:08.380> continue<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:09.800> so

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
nipple to fit in and continue like so so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.900 
nipple to fit in and continue like so so
as<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.670> see<00:02:10.940> there's<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.990> little<00:02:12.320> bit

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
as you can see there's a little bit

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.450 
as you can see there's a little bit
happening<00:02:13.910> right<00:02:14.090> now<00:02:14.360> coming<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.650> how

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
happening right now coming in and how

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.520 
happening right now coming in and how
long<00:02:16.730> does<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.000> usually<00:02:17.150> take<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.810> get<00:02:18.230> 5

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
long does it usually take to get 5

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.210 
long does it usually take to get 5
ounces<00:02:19.060> well<00:02:20.060> let's<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.810> right<00:02:21.200> now<00:02:21.500> I've<00:02:21.920> got

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
ounces well let's see right now I've got

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
ounces well let's see right now I've got
maybe<00:02:23.080> two<00:02:24.080> some<00:02:24.290> acts<00:02:24.590> I'm<00:02:25.460> coming<00:02:25.820> up<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.090> an

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
maybe two some acts I'm coming up on an

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.710 
maybe two some acts I'm coming up on an
ounce<00:02:26.450> or<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.640> five<00:02:28.640> ounces<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.450> about

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
ounce or so five ounces is to about

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.850 
ounce or so five ounces is to about
right<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.830> might<00:02:34.130> take<00:02:34.400> me<00:02:34.670> about<00:02:35.860> 10

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
right here so it might take me about 10

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.110 
right here so it might take me about 10
to<00:02:37.160> 15<00:02:37.640> minutes<00:02:37.820> if<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:40.040> pump<00:02:40.370> each<00:02:40.790> time

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
to 15 minutes if that to pump each time

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.590 
to 15 minutes if that to pump each time
and<00:02:42.190> sometimes<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.670> breath<00:02:43.970> seems<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.570> a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
and sometimes one breath seems to have a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.360

do and then after I finish this is just

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.960 
do and then after I finish this is just
an<00:03:24.590> example<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.340> would<00:03:25.610> finish<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:27.970> take

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
an example but I would finish and take

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.840 
an example but I would finish and take
it<00:03:29.120> off<00:03:29.330> course<00:03:30.260> I'm<00:03:30.500> not<00:03:30.710> wearing<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.400> have

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
it off course I'm not wearing I have

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.300 
it off course I'm not wearing I have
typically<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.690> nipple<00:03:33.110> shield<00:03:33.320> in<00:03:33.620> here<00:03:33.980> or<00:03:34.160> not

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
typically a nipple shield in here or not

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.940 
typically a nipple shield in here or not
as<00:03:34.430> nipple<00:03:34.730> shield<00:03:34.940> what's<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.270> called<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.630> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
as nipple shield what's it called like a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.100 
as nipple shield what's it called like a
protector<00:03:36.950> for<00:03:37.400> your<00:03:37.550> clothes<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.750> put<00:03:39.080> that

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
protector for your clothes so I put that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.190 
protector for your clothes so I put that
in<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:40.310> shirt<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.820> I'm<00:03:41.600> not<00:03:41.750> wearing<00:03:41.900> right

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
in the shirt that I'm not wearing right

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.440 
in the shirt that I'm not wearing right
now<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.700> would<00:03:44.000> remove<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:47.090> I've<00:03:47.240> done

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
now and I would remove this if I've done

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.700 
now and I would remove this if I've done
both<00:03:47.660> sides<00:03:48.220> remove<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.370> top<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:52.480> put<00:03:53.480> on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
both sides remove the top and put on

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.950 
both sides remove the top and put on
typically<00:03:54.710> you<00:03:54.860> have<00:03:55.040> another<00:03:55.780> top<00:03:56.780> that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
typically you have another top that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.860 
typically you have another top that
comes<00:03:57.140> with<00:03:57.380> your<00:03:57.620> your<00:03:58.490> containers<00:03:59.150> that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
comes with your your containers that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.040 
comes with your your containers that
make<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.260> easier<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.220> store<00:04:01.490> in<00:04:01.700> your

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
make it easier to store in your

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.450 
make it easier to store in your
refrigerator<00:04:03.050> so<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.410> would<00:04:03.560> put<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:03.800> top<00:04:04.220> on

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
refrigerator so I would put that top on

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.140 
refrigerator so I would put that top on
and<00:04:05.380> put<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.500> in<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.770> little<00:04:07.010> brown<00:04:07.160> bag<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.910> bring

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and put it in a little brown bag I bring

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.540 
and put it in a little brown bag I bring
little<00:04:08.450> baggies<00:04:09.100> if<00:04:10.100> I<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.460> have<00:04:12.490> like<00:04:13.490> a

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
little baggies if I don't have like a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.280 
little baggies if I don't have like a

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
lunch pail or something from home I

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.670 
lunch pail or something from home I
would<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.680> put<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.330> bag<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:18.350> have
