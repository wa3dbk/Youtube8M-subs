00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 it's a breed of what really 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.230
 they are atypical who are novel to a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.790
 little crazy necessarily eh it rubs 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 a lot in the bunch and you're 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.290
 interested in this caste of sprinters 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.090
 begins does it entail who are they 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 really the race of sprinters a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.370
 report of nicolas g in you serves him 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.370
 from christian bouin 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.340
 in the squad they are told different the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 gladiator sprinters throw 70 km 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.630
 hour after five hours of race 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.440
 thoroughbred explosive sometimes at the limit of 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.440
 arrogance 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 possibly there could be 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.790
 guys stronger than me it can happen 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 to everyone but I do not think that 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.239
 it gives I do not think there is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 someone stronger than me and he 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230
 there is a stronger team than 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.390
 mine 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.100
 Mark Cavendish The Greatest Sprinter 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.000
 all time 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.390
 25 stages of the tournament 101 total wins 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.159
 last january in calpe and spain 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.880
 than to cut out the last 200 meters 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880
 okay 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.760
 with his teammates alessandro petacchi 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 and tom boonen the cav enchains the mind 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.450
 five straight lines a violent effort 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.540
 even for the fastest man in the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 planet 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.280
 mark cavendish is known for having 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.700
 character 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 the proof we can ask you a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.210
 question to ask a question not my 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.610
 job is to win races and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.270
 without something decent of it you 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.740
 will not be happy if I come and that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.190
 I grab this camera if I stir it 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:17.610
 micro I do not like that and it's not me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.830
 it's the same he has or crying to fart 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.700
 schott of not that the longest the most 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.270
 easy of world 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.370
 I prefer a chalc parcel that 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.380
 always says him who always happy 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.540
 I have never seen problems with 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 champions I had always had 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.180
 problems of people who think they 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.940
 are champions the sprinter found 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.980
 so whole golden night and full dgo a 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.140
 runner obsessed with victory and this 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.380
 famous last mile at this moment 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.840
 he enters a second state does the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.230
 branched brain somehow she 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 gets into our bubble and focus 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.250
 only on the sprint and the 200 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.019
 last meters 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.530
 in fact you are online by visiting 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.299
 can we and you tell yourself I'll be there in the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.040
 final I would have the chance to launch in 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.870
 the sprint I 'm under control it's 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.090
 very rational almost scientific 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.620
 we did the calculations but I have a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.360
 advantage is that my frequency 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.500
 cardiac remains base because I am 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.820
 more relaxed and when you feel that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.190
 you have good people but it's true 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.739
 that you can give everything that nobody 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.790
 can beat you it's a moment where you 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.250
 experienced a great this species 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.950
 adrenaline tension in the pack this 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.950
 mouth it rubs and sometimes it derails 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.230
 look at something that is we tend 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.420
 to keep his place so we put a shot of 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.129
 elbow and we touch really low on 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.150
 really find the opponent on 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:57.230
 the shoulder to send it back 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.150
 where he came pocket yes times you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.819
 try to push each other and others 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.750
 Once it is at the foot of his vertigo is 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.849
 a real fight away from the tumult of 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.319
 sprints nacer bouhanni to prepare the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.780
 Giro with Jacques de Crillon 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.769
 coach outings of 5 hours and 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.769
 10 second sprints 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.400
 start and then stop from 0 to 60 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.400
 10 in 10 seconds 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.680
 as cavendish before him it says 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.280
 dangerous and unmanageable these critics 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.470
 he prefers to ignore them wang who had you 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.930
 the others nothing more egocentric 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.490
 that a sprinter yet they are 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.690
 now the last floor of a rocket 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.020
 where everyone has their role 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.010
 the train that of giant soumano is 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.460
 become a reference 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.919
 this winter the Dutch team repeated 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.860
 his scales with a goal put on 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:04.910
 orbit marcel kittel at 200 meters from the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.350
 line it makes a lot of sense in eight 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.280
 runners work together and that in 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.020
 face you are all alone 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.530
 you have no chance for me 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.919
 working with a train is coming back 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.080
 in France 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.590
 we are finally inspired by these famous train 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760
 after being a very good sprinter 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:27.410
 sébastien chavanel has reconverted 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:29.870
 pilot fish of nacer bouhanni for 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.390
 take him the sprints on the giro he has 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.390
 chained sessions harassing 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.249
 I asked myself the right question I 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.489
 will do 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.999
 I want to sell myself as a fish 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:48.829
 pilot because that's what I missed 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:51.439
 that's what I missed in the year 

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:53.629
 hinge of my career between 26 and 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.399
 now if I had support 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:56.619
 maybe I will have my career will have 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.359
 been different 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:01.309
 yesterday the work of sébastien chavanel 

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.109
 was not enough to nacke bouhanni for 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.749
 win the second stage of the Giro 

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:06.529
 French bows to what is happening 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.559
 do the best in the world 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.229
 the German marcel kittel new boss 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.390
 of a very closed circle that of the stars 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.920
 Sprint 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.920
 nothing else ap
