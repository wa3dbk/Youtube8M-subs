00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.099
 do not 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 i 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:26.180
 hello friends today I want 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.410
 teach them how to make a kangaroo on their motorbike 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 first they must have a motorcycle like this 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 the seconds that we need is a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.960
 piece of cardboard or a table 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.570
 you can get it anywhere 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.930
 something like that will be put here by those 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.930
 details 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.579
 this is going to allow them more stability 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.900
 at the time of doing your calculation 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.590
 the third thing they need is a sheet of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590
 paper 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.920
 how is the time to place over 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.680
 of your cardboard and then to see if to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.340
 something 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.340
 how 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 always downloading the pocket to the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.590
 insurance time 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.680
 a hard marker marc 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.680
 preferably in black 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.300
 now what are you going to do next 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.300
 good to do something like this 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500
 Y 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 this is more or less a kangaroo the sertÃ³n 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.009
 It is the prototype 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.220
 after about two or three weeks of 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.080
 practice this is requires work 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.950
 to be able to make a good kangaroo 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.600
 on his motorcycle 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 after about two or three weeks of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.850
 work will achieve something else or 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.850
 less like this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.100
 but it requires a lot of effort and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.240
 dedication 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.010
 good friends 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.320

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.910
 how to make a kangaroo on his motorcycle I hope 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.910
