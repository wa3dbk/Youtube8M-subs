experience of this application which is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740 
experience of this application which is
a<00:01:46.770> darn<00:01:47.100> shame<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.850> absolutely<00:01:48.180> loved

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
a darn shame because we absolutely loved

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
a darn shame because we absolutely loved
it<00:01:48.899> there's<00:01:49.409> simply<00:01:49.560> no<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.979> hook<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it there's simply no way to hook a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
it there's simply no way to hook a
camera<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> 3d<00:01:51.390> viewer<00:01:51.570> itself<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
camera up to the 3d viewer itself and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
camera up to the 3d viewer itself and
then<00:01:52.290> give<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> tour<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.210> application

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
then give you a tour of the application

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
then give you a tour of the application
as<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.470> viewed<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.119> can't

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
as it's actually viewed but we can't

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.639 
as it's actually viewed but we can't
tell<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.560> our

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
tell you about it which is kind of our

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.690 
tell you about it which is kind of our
jobs<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.340> ahead<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.670> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
jobs we're going to go ahead and do that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
jobs we're going to go ahead and do that
so<00:02:00.390> we're<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> slap<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.380> straight

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so we're to slap this thing get straight

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
so we're to slap this thing get straight

another incentive to go get it this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.619 
another incentive to go get it this
application<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.910> three<00:02:09.149> dollars<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
application is three dollars and

ninety-nine cents in the App Store which
is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:11.970> great<00:02:12.180> value<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.989> us

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
is a pretty great value to us

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
is a pretty great value to us
especially<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.459> already<00:02:14.610> have<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.879> my<00:02:15.120> 3d

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
especially if you already have the my 3d

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.960 
especially if you already have the my 3d
viewer<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.920> way<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.159> works<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.790> simply

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
viewer the way this works is you simply

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.850 
viewer the way this works is you simply
hit<00:02:18.150> begin<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> application

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
hit begin and then the application

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
hit begin and then the application
splits<00:02:20.190> into<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> kind<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.790> dual<00:02:21.000> mode<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
splits into this kind of dual mode and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.809 
splits into this kind of dual mode and
once<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.190> fitted<00:02:23.459> into<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
once it's actually fitted into the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.460 
once it's actually fitted into the
device<00:02:24.060> these<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.810> integrated

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
device these are actually integrated

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.860 
device these are actually integrated
together<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.190> then<00:02:26.819> form<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.330> cohesive<00:02:27.629> unit

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
together and then form a cohesive unit

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.190 
together and then form a cohesive unit
that's<00:02:28.319> actually<00:02:28.739> in<00:02:29.069> full<00:02:29.340> three<00:02:29.580> dimensions

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that's actually in full three dimensions

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.750 
that's actually in full three dimensions
which<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.319> pretty<00:02:31.470> cool<00:02:31.739> but<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.549> cool

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
which is pretty cool but not so cool

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.160 
which is pretty cool but not so cool
here<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> screen<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.750> said<00:02:33.870> it's

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
here on the screen but like I said it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.839 
here on the screen but like I said it's
a<00:02:34.560> shame<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.040> can't<00:02:35.069> give<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.670> full

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
a shame that we can't give you the full

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.960 
a shame that we can't give you the full
experience<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.019> we'll<00:02:37.319> do<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.590> best<00:02:37.879> so<00:02:38.879> what

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
experience but we'll do our best so what

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.699 
experience but we'll do our best so what
this<00:02:39.060> app<00:02:39.269> does<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.510> gives<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.079> essentially

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
this app does is gives you essentially

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.500 
this app does is gives you essentially
the<00:02:40.829> option<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.250> float<00:02:41.670> about<00:02:41.909> or<00:02:42.239> soar

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
the option to float about or soar

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.119 
the option to float about or soar
through<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.780> solar<00:02:43.140> system<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.920> would

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
through the solar system as you would

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.800 
through the solar system as you would
say<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.849> were<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> spaceship<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.629> just

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
say if you were in a spaceship they just
