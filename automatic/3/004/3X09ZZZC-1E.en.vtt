like<00:01:38.130> I've<00:01:38.310> sort<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> paper<00:01:39.409> which<00:01:40.409> releases<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
like I've sort of paper which releases a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
like I've sort of paper which releases a
vapor<00:01:41.490> constantly<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> keep<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> lid<00:01:42.720> on

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
vapor constantly and you keep the lid on

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.649 
vapor constantly and you keep the lid on
top<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> stops<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.189> brushes<00:01:44.670> from<00:01:45.390> going

rock solid and becoming

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.780 
rock solid and becoming
