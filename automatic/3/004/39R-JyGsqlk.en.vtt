00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.380
 yes 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.829
 well yes I have made a loss of 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.110
 a few months since that first 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.550
 the piece that you have seen of 30 seconds 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.720
 I recorded it a long time ago when I was 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.520
 doing the missions of the ships 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.190
 just when I finish uploading the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.840
 last and it is busy as you have seen 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.269
 and well, so far I have not been able 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.220
 back has also come very well this 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.290
 for inactivity in handles and more 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.720
 everything to take it now with desire 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.000
 they make 10 4 and because they have left new 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.790
 patch this time I have two points 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 I think for 2.4 that I think it's very good 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.520
 who have added this mine or do not remember 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.950
 I was before 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.049
 they have also fixed the book by which 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 I did not really want to play at 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:21.650
 campaign and it was this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.650
 to see here kill 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.500
 as it was to see the most empty 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.510
 I have to see boston or something not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.790
 here you see, I did not leave 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.920
 pivots anywhere 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.650
 remember that we had to locate 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.509
 some pivots I do not know what to find it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.490
 I had to place three aunts online 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.619
 to see if he found one and such and not 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 we knew how it was so simple 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.729
 that there was a book and there are many people like 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.500
 I did not get these three 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.090
 pivots that are the start or 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.380
 start and now you have to go changing 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 then moving it and such 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.759
 good and to investigate how it is done 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.650
 and I'll bring it but good at least 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.300
 the problem has already been solved 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.520
 and we are going to continue with the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.180
 missions of the hacienda that by where 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180
 leave the egg 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 because if 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 sensation 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.939
 Well, to sit down 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.939
 but analyzes with everything 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.080
 venegas 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.890
 after analyzing a damn time 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.890
 now you do not put anything 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.470
 with how easy was aunt 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.470
 a man 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.590
 ok I know how it is done with the l1 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 keeping pointed on the objective 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.640
 the free one and it gives you for read the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.580
 task that is doing 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.590
 now this task has already registered 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.870
 before going down the stairs 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 and I'm going down to the epic 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.670
 well calculate a little bit over here 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.710
 and there they have taken you 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.230
 OK 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.230
 of fucking mother let's see 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.980
 well it is entered again when what 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.349
 is doing an activity can be 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.799
 that he has already read it or we are not going to read 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:52.709
 stay still take three of three 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.709
 good or less we keep looking 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.129
 good at last - more I think it's grace 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 leave patch because this mission does not 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.989

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.159
 right it is so strong for me 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.879
 cone of feathers was boring I was 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.669
 tired of trying to read interactions 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.549
 the villagers of the hacienda 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.750
 and I say casualties I still have to catch 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.799
 feathers and I 've put myself to it I've 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.840
 put to get all your own 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.080
 I just lacked the ones here from the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.660
 frontier and well I've come across 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.780
 this by chance and look where 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.389

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.389
 assigned let's see how we do it 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.920
 but with a rejection 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.920
 to do everything 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.620
 what has happened there have thrown to me 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.620
 target to the ground or something why 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.389

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.280

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.420

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.420
 Captain's shit 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.820
 let's go strong in the heart 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.910
 taking 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:31.110

 well because bad 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.710
 not whole because I was not killing your 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.910

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.910

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.560
 heavy end are all 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.560
 light media that were 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.370
 and if he has not left 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.700
 that the truth is no longer forgotten 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 now 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.690
 to unleash the casualties 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.300
 and much less have 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.800
 young girl has got the sword 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.570
 in all our harvest for the crown 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:53.150
 they killed the animals they threw salt in the 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.150
 land and they took us out and you saw the rest 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.249
 still alive, no 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:03.299
 I'm afraid we do not have to thank 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.299
 we have nothing left 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.590
 and something you can do 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:12.990
 whatever is 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.860
 I live in a small community not far 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.680
 of 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.169
 the soil is good the people with whom 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.100
 I live needs fresh vegetables wheat and 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.770
 corn 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.280
 and rebuild our farm you can 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.280
 to flourish 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.479
 but let's go 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.170

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:49.320

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:51.740

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.419
 and finally the last pen that is going 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.030

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:02.090
