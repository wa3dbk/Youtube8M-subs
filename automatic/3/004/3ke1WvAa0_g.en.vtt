00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.710
 and today we are going to talk about the best quality 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.710
 linked with the good energy of the front 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.810
 where you can ideally indicate the tree 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.539
 Christmas at this time we are 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.429
 in front of these golden trees 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.800
 gods that you can use perfectly in 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.800
 the southern sector 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.680
 since there is the star not the 5 that 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 It benefits from the metal element and also 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.300
 is going to help you counteract the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.300
 negative energy of the star 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.329
 your Christmas tree I know 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.610
 color is ideal is to use a 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.430
 predominantly red like that 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.770
 we now have many people in the tree 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.550
 ask if it matters the color of the tree 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.560
 as such really the common of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.140
 Christmas trees that we see is in color 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.720
 green what we're going to do is give you that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.680
 touch of feng shui with the predominance in 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.960
 the decoration 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.990
 although you can see in this tree the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.940
 predominance is red and gold and 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.490
 that's perfect because the tree is no longer 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.430
 it looks so green but it has the touch of 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.300
 honshu and with elements plays in the color 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.180
 red and very sharp and pyramidal shapes 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.619
 as for example they have flowers now 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.619
 red inside long 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.329
 if you are going to place your Christmas tree in 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.850
 the sectors west or south west the ideal 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.409
 is to use combinations of green and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.270
 red when we have in this beautiful 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.030
 Christmas tree in those sectors 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.979
 you will have wooden stars therefore 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 you can balance it very well with 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.990
 green colors and red accents for 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.149
 mitigate the energy of the star 3 that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.220
 is an associated star rose 'conflict 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.990
 remember the union of colors green and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.990
 red in these sectors is ideal 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.259
 for a tree in the northern sector in 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.709
 our house 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.020
 the ideal is to use circular shapes in 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.480
 golden white colors inclusive 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.370
 a white tree would be ideal in this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 place in this sector let's leave the star 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.030
 not the 2 that is the social star the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 diseases and the presence of elements 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.920
 metal will be excellent for you to pass 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.700
 a healthier and more beautiful Christmas with 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 these accessories 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.290
 in the center of the star on the 6th and 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 center is also an excellent place 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.069
 to locate our Christmas tree in 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.110
 this case we have these tapes that 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.420
 Besides being very fashionable they combine 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.160
 perfectly the five elements look 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.970
 that have a color combination 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.250
 excellent would be ideal in the central area 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.590

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.080
