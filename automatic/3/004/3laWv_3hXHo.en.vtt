00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello my name is body specifically 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.320
 for the site have a more 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.389
 I will now show how to fit for each 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.670
 the easiest installation and post Nastya 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.400
 and then increase sensitivity even 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.130
 for this we take from the tip of our 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
 core cord 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.150
 I'm on it a little loop 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.320
 serving look fortification tent 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.469
 it can be said 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 five as any number eight 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.930
 knot that will lay down just uncomfortable 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.110
 first war 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.590
 kill though i want to note that length 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.270
 it must be so long 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:54.050
 matching tent cover 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:01:00.559
 which is a little wet hair 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.559
 tightened to cut off the tip all unnecessary 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.330
 This is what should happen for 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330
 here to pass a strip 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.980
 next we will need to do 2 without hands 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.440
 serving as a mount for the trough itself 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.729
 this will need to hide a little further 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.810
 another node which is also possible 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.600
 hide eights well I see all the same 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
 surgical site and preferably 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.740
 to make 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.340
 few turns 34 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.610
 you can even 5 still a manger at the moment 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.240
 casting has good strength 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.240
 genetics 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:05.320
 about here means a little the length of this 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.540
 fives should be such that the feeder 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 walked freely out and him and 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.530
 freely could not 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.900
 here is our installation ready only 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.900
 put on a trough 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:29.440
 I can say that at the moment of the sofa 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.570
 feeders do not need to insole tighten 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.510
 the end of your composition russia attacks on the ears 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.020
 swivel 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.480
 plays an important role and also in 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.350
 fishing will be convenient to change the feeders not 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.580
 need to sit with a needle and how 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:52.810
 do the tip here and there not until the end 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.300
 bring everything in principle and ready 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.300
 our loop still want to point out what 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.790
 lead retraction 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.489
 must be well at least 1 2 centimeters 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.890
 longer than the trough 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:16.320
 which leads 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.320
 tangle leads meditation 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.020
 I will bring the bodies to the market
