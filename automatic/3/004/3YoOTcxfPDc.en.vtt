00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 we enter 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.869
 here if you saw windows xp this 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.479

 set the final touch to remove meta 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.610
 and never forget because if 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.170
 delete then minekravt does not start all 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.390
 so we set minecraft on 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
