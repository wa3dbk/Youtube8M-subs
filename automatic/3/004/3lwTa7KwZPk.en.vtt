00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:16.699
 in 1842 I the only thing I've done a young salesman and contractors 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.529
 modified a machine so that in addition to using the serial to separate the grain 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.830
 from the straw and deliver them clean in the same operation 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.760
 the producers who saw the operation of the team asked 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.380
 excited in Gijón 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 quiles manufacture an equal and so the brand was born you want 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 that throughout history would surprise with its innovations once and for all 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.370
 again 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 So it was with the first tractor with steam engine 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.690
 and then with the first gasoline tractor 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 to mention some examples of the time 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 meanwhile you want to expand from your headquarters goes into 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.870
 wisconsin so the world in 1890 opened a branch in buenos aires 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.790
 the second international office after the one in england giving 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.750
 account of the global importance of the Argentine countryside since then 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.310
 for those years there will be without weapons there would be a smithy in the city of new 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.480
 covenant pennsylvania would quickly be highlighted by the repair of 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.900
 engines and it would reveal itself as a genius of mechanics 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.920
 first he drew attention with his design of a grain grinder 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.330
 laptop 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.710
 noting that many engines were broken by volume expansion 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 of his internal liquids when freezing he invented a motor to proof of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.990
 freezing that robbed customers of the cold regions of all 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 North America 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.619
 the development became an event and was the kick-off to the brand 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.210
 a manga drawing 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 then other successes would come as the forage machinery would remain 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.470
 world famous 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.870
 these pioneers 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.360
 planted the seed of queens and not a conan two large brands 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.460
 that were destined to prosper and become global icons of the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 agricultural technology however it was just the beginning the embryo of a 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.990
 much larger inheritance that would be completed with the incorporation of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.320
 other big brands that revolutionized agricultural mechanization throughout 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.579
 20th century 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.909
 let's know the 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:21.180
 peace these texts in 1902 if you create international the rest as a result of 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 the merger between several North American companies 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.969
 international Carlos Tevez was responsible among other feats 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.189
 technological 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.019
 of the creation of formal the first multipurpose tractor and ctera well the 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.139
 fire the first axial-flow harvester a rotor 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.730
 another protagonist was gentry fort who was already a famous automaker 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.249
 when he presented the prototype of a gasoline tractor 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:50.439
 commercially launched ten years later under the brand by sony the 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.259
 equipment caused a sensation by its low price to be produced in series and with 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.709
 a work organization based on its automotive plants 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.379
 In parallel to the other side of the Atlantic the Belgian mechanic bundled a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.199
 keys began to manufacture threshing machines and then to build a 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:14.449
 plant in the city of sea of ​​gent belgium in italy fiat began to 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:19.709
 industrially produce the 702 model that would debut with full honors at 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.999
 win an international plowing contest chelís france during the decade 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:31.159
 1930 Senator Yovani Algeria founder of the company intends to modernize the 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.749
 Italian agriculture and establishes a program of cooperative alliances 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.659
 a big boost to production 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.080
 both grains and detractors two decades later fiat 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 is installed industrially in Argentina where it would be the first 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.120
 tractor plant in the country and in which it develops successful models that still 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.840
 today you can find us working we have many Argentine fields up 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.019
 here the pioneers 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.529
 from then on a new era begins that of the 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.529
 knowledge integration 3 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:12.900
 in 1964 nicolás acquire the majority shareholding of 6 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.239
 I wanted to go to one of the biggest grain harvester manufacturers in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.430
 Europe and it becomes a world-wide species in grain harvest and 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.560
 forages a few years later the brand ratifies its prestige with the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.100
 introduction of double rotor axial harvesters a concept 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.889
 exclusive that lasts in their machines until the present in 1985 occurs 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.750
 the merger of two of the largest manufacturers in the industry 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.240
 American 6 the international astral letter unite its paths giving rise to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.720
 mark 6 and hp shortly after the first fruit of this union with the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.800
 launch of the legendary line of magnum tractors 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.860
 the machinery sector continued to evolve at a dizzying pace and 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.319
 in that frame by tractors joins the triumph 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.580
 then the company would be acquired by fiat that would later incorporate 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.300
 also to that there h in this way that there is not even a polar if they convert 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.889
 the dry tail arm of the business group that today includes other brands 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.779
 emblematic of different industries such as fiat ferrari maserati lancia krais 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.979
 long indecopi fiat powertrain yes 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.730
 that the simile with the 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.990
 is a world leader in research and development 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.099
 leader in production of clean energy-based equipment linkedin 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.470
 Inditex productivity in global presence 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.350
 opening a new chapter of his centennial history that he did not even 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.080
 Koran 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.280
 and the courses to announce the installation of a factory in Argentina the work and 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.560
 is underway and the new plant located in Ferreyra Córdoba and 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.620
 in a few months more there will be products that ischia and not a 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.610
 jornal in the last generation that will have the mission of supplying the 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.460
 Argentine market and many other countries in the world through the
