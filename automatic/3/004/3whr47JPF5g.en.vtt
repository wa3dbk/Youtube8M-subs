00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.940 
questions
finding<00:05:59.340> on<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.550> answers<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.770> putting<00:06:01.770> in

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
finding on the answers and putting in

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.440 
finding on the answers and putting in
their<00:06:02.370> scores<00:06:02.820> again<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:04.830> is<00:06:05.010> like<00:06:05.190> a

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
their scores again this is like a

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.470 
their scores again this is like a
12-minute<00:06:06.450> video<00:06:06.770> this<00:06:07.770> may<00:06:07.980> sound<00:06:08.010> minor<00:06:08.550> but

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
12-minute video this may sound minor but

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.680 
12-minute video this may sound minor but
to<00:06:09.720> me<00:06:10.580> this<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.639> like<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:12.150> worst<00:06:12.180> possible

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
to me this is like the worst possible

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.230 
to me this is like the worst possible
outcome<00:06:13.490> because<00:06:14.490> she<00:06:14.790> is<00:06:14.880> going<00:06:15.060> to<00:06:15.150> be

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
outcome because she is going to be

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.960 
outcome because she is going to be
engrossed<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:16.800> this<00:06:17.639> school<00:06:18.540> making<00:06:18.900> business
