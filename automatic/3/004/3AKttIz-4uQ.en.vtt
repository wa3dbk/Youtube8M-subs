00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.820
 so that was the chorus of it relative 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.390
 easy that's really just whole 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.430
 grades 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.110
 I showed in the video that one 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.100
 the thing also pretty deep 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.030
 can play 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 in the original one can hear that he is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
 I believe everything to be deep 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.230
 I also did that once 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.879
 in one go 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.500
 if you have to do it necessarily 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.910
 stands on another sheet of who it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.839
 that can be very authentic 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.570
 Of course, like to do 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.160
 yes that was his refrains actually 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.579
 relatively easy all the notes though 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.079
 Also there's a close-up and here we go 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.520
 now the course comes to play me 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.869
 no extra again before because the need 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.149
 i'm not that totally 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.950
 you just need four for the course 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.140
 Chords could actually from the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 Principle of playing the course starts with 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.250
 a c power comes and generally it 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.350
 are always quite notes so just whole 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.289
 sounds sound finished off so the im 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.000
 year is a goal partner zeigefingers 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.600
 is the third bund on the a-side because 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.640
 sc 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.200
 the kids on top and we have bock 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.610
 the park and with three doors to grab 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.399
 then grab your little finger 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 also in the fifth and then on the b page 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.220
 would it be then 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.710
 I always finger three 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.479
 So I got used to the accord 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.460
 So we go there sounds exactly one 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.320
 clock from the next chord is a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.570
 we just change the power 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 courtney side then just go with it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590
 the index finger the third bunch to the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.270
 deep side that's a cheek so 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.310
 he comes number two then move 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.200
 we simply put the accord in the fifth 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.200
 Bund stay on the same page 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 that would be an apart that we too 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.979
 move a day long in and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.049
 Let's go back to an F in the first 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 bunch and in the eyes all day 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.729
 then that sounds like that is actually the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.729
 refrain played before 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:19.319
 13 43 that's all you play 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.230
 completely by chf and that three times 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.180
 three times and on the fourth passage 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 this refrain we equip with the c 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.780
 everything stays the same, it becomes one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.569
 whole note and then there is that 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.640
 also leave a whole note too 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.959
 just like that and now at the end around there 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.040
 get out of the number goes there 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.890
 now on the same swf leaves the first 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.330
 stifles that more often than a quarter on and off 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.450
 At the moment 2 he only plays 8 1 2 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.790
 and 3 and 4 and now when time is now three 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 and four and he just does it two 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.870
 contacts there will always be two contacts f 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.790
 played by whom we stop just that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.680
 first play as a quarter open and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.019
 because the rest just as yes 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.850
 dampened stop just let go 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:12.090
 that is the last refrain passage 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:16.140
 is then each 12 34 23 14 13 41 24 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.180
 and then just the melody comes 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.040
 again back so it all clear 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 or just stop the next part in that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.739
 song i think the refrain is nice 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.540
 easy to understand 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.739
 that's what the boxer does rhythmically 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.310
 Then you can do a little more 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.630
 of course a bit too 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.500
 experiment that stands of course 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.980
 out of question 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.980
 have fun
