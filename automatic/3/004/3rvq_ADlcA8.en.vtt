crude system highlighting f7 at the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.979 
crude system highlighting f7 at the
moment<00:00:36.590> but<00:00:37.129> by<00:00:37.309> playing<00:00:37.640> e6<00:00:38.149> blanks<00:00:38.569> creating

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
moment but by playing e6 blanks creating

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.649 
moment but by playing e6 blanks creating
more<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.469> these<00:00:39.710> um<00:00:39.999> you<00:00:40.999> know<00:00:41.120> dark<00:00:41.390> square

more of these um you know dark square

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.410 
more of these um you know dark square
weaknesses<00:00:42.309> around<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.640> place<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.329> know

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
weaknesses around the place you know

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.669 
weaknesses around the place you know
like<00:00:44.629> here<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.609> as<00:00:46.609> well<00:00:46.879> as<00:00:46.909> well<00:00:47.179> as<00:00:47.469> his<00:00:48.469> fin

square<00:00:51.170> uses<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:53.739> 93-97<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:56.769> apparently<00:00:57.769> you

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
square uses so 93-97 and apparently you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.719 
square uses so 93-97 and apparently you
know<00:00:58.039> according<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.429> rybka<00:00:59.559> in<00:01:00.559> this<00:01:01.249> position

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
know according to rybka in this position

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.430 
know according to rybka in this position
this<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.210> promising<00:01:02.629> for<00:01:02.809> white<00:01:02.929> just<00:01:03.109> Bishop

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
this is promising for white just Bishop

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760 
this is promising for white just Bishop
g5<00:01:03.859> just<00:01:04.820> let<00:01:05.059> positionally<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.560> gives

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
g5 just let positionally and it gives

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.770 
g5 just let positionally and it gives
for<00:01:06.950> example<00:01:07.280> castles<00:01:07.729> console<00:01:08.330> queenside

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
for example castles console queenside

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.050 
for example castles console queenside
rook<00:01:09.740> e8<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:10.909> waiting<00:01:11.180> for<00:01:11.329> okay<00:01:11.570> because<00:01:12.170> um<00:01:12.469> I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
rook e8 so waiting for okay because um I

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.209 
rook e8 so waiting for okay because um I
guess<00:01:14.079> f6<00:01:15.079> is<00:01:15.200> out<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.409> question<00:01:15.560> maybe<00:01:15.829> Bishop

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
guess f6 is out of question maybe Bishop

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.910 
guess f6 is out of question maybe Bishop
these<00:01:16.399> Saints<00:01:16.789> there<00:01:17.170> if<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.590> have<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> look<00:01:18.799> at

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
these Saints there if we have a look at

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.319 
these Saints there if we have a look at
that<00:01:18.979> Bishop<00:01:19.310> e6<00:01:19.729> because<00:01:20.000> there's<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> nasty

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
that Bishop e6 because there's a nasty

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.109 
that Bishop e6 because there's a nasty
pin<00:01:21.369> so<00:01:22.369> if<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.420> back<00:01:23.630> plays<00:01:24.109> rookie<00:01:24.469> aid<00:01:25.119> to

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
pin so if so back plays rookie aid to

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.700 
pin so if so back plays rookie aid to
try<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:26.509> numb<00:01:27.460> do<00:01:28.460> something<00:01:28.850> then

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
try and numb do something then

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.160 
try and numb do something then
apparently<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:30.979> is<00:01:31.159> ok<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:31.729> like<00:01:32.240> h4<00:01:32.780> is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
apparently this is ok because like h4 is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
apparently this is ok because like h4 is
starting<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.649> be<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.799> good<00:01:34.250> advantage<00:01:34.549> for

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
starting to be a good advantage for

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.719 
starting to be a good advantage for
white<00:01:35.530> like<00:01:36.530> Bishop<00:01:36.829> f6<00:01:37.189> here<00:01:38.259> taking<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.729> if

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
white like Bishop f6 here taking and if

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.270 
white like Bishop f6 here taking and if
this<00:01:41.149> g4<00:01:41.719> it's<00:01:42.109> it's<00:01:42.439> interesting<00:01:42.740> now<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
this g4 it's it's interesting now a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.980 
this g4 it's it's interesting now a
rybka<00:01:43.789> shows<00:01:44.030> basically<00:01:44.329> a<00:01:44.509> positional

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
rybka shows basically a positional

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.800 
rybka shows basically a positional
strategy<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.729> highlighting<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:47.030> not<00:01:47.359> just

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
strategy of highlighting not not just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.919 
strategy of highlighting not not just
dark<00:01:48.409> squares<00:01:48.710> here<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:49.850> also<00:01:49.969> here<00:01:50.359> later<00:01:50.600> if

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
dark squares here but also here later if

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.319 
dark squares here but also here later if
we<00:01:51.109> look<00:01:51.259> at<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.469> continuation<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:52.939> see<00:01:53.149> that

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
we look at this continuation we see that

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.389 
we look at this continuation we see that
it's<00:01:53.420> not<00:01:53.539> about<00:01:53.780> opening<00:01:54.259> up<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.979> Kings<00:01:55.189> side

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
it's not about opening up the Kings side

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.429 
it's not about opening up the Kings side
it's<00:01:56.329> about<00:01:56.420> highlighting<00:01:56.840> all<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> dark

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
it's about highlighting all the dark

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.380 
it's about highlighting all the dark
squares<00:01:57.710> look<00:01:57.920> at<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:58.070> Queenie<00:01:58.399> free<00:01:58.729> not<00:01:59.359> a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
squares look at this Queenie free not a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.080 
squares look at this Queenie free not a
42<00:01:59.810> c<00:01:59.960> 5<00:02:00.229> which<00:02:00.890> I've<00:02:01.310> used<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.700> sometimes

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
42 c 5 which I've used it sometimes

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.929 
42 c 5 which I've used it sometimes
myself<00:02:02.569> as<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.899> strategy<00:02:03.380> but<00:02:04.069> it's<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:04.399> darts

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
myself as a strategy but it's like darts

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.669 
myself as a strategy but it's like darts
care<00:02:05.119> domination<00:02:05.780> all<00:02:05.899> over<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.289> board<00:02:06.439> now

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
care domination all over the board now

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.830 
care domination all over the board now
we've<00:02:06.950> set<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.609> Queen<00:02:07.850> centralizing<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.600> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
we've set the Queen centralizing in and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.300 
we've set the Queen centralizing in and
this<00:02:09.200> will<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.440> much<00:02:09.590> better<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:09.890> white<00:02:10.130> with

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
this will be much better for white with

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.660 
this will be much better for white with
f5<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> there's<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.680> beautiful<00:02:13.100> positional<00:02:13.580> way

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
f5 so there's a beautiful positional way

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.000 
f5 so there's a beautiful positional way
of<00:02:13.790> playing<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.180> whole<00:02:14.390> system<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.020> black<00:02:15.980> is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
of playing this whole system if black is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.220 
of playing this whole system if black is
going<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.520> pawn<00:02:16.790> triangle<00:02:17.390> pawns

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
going to have this pawn triangle pawns

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.390 
going to have this pawn triangle pawns
are<00:02:18.410> online<00:02:18.620> squares

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
are online squares

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.190 
are online squares
these<00:02:19.640> dark<00:02:19.879> square<00:02:20.150> weaknesses<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
these dark square weaknesses so it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
these dark square weaknesses so it
doesn't<00:02:21.439> have<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.739> be<00:02:21.799> always<00:02:22.010> always<00:02:22.340> about

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
doesn't have to be always always about

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.179 
doesn't have to be always always about
peeling<00:02:23.000> open<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.420> H<00:02:23.569> file<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:24.980> we<00:02:25.040> go

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
peeling open the H file but if we go

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.339 
peeling open the H file but if we go
back<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.610> game<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.150> thought<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.930> had<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> very

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
back to the game I thought I had a very

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.350 
back to the game I thought I had a very
promising<00:02:27.790> continuation<00:02:28.790> anyway<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.269> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
promising continuation anyway in the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.020 
promising continuation anyway in the
game<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:31.099> after<00:02:31.129> Queen<00:02:31.489> before<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.849> thought

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
game so after Queen before I thought

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.410 
game so after Queen before I thought
that<00:02:32.180> was<00:02:32.269> an<00:02:32.329> odd<00:02:32.480> move<00:02:33.909> in<00:02:34.909> fact<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.329> whole

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that was an odd move in fact the whole

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.720 
that was an odd move in fact the whole
Queen<00:02:35.720> a5<00:02:36.109> idea<00:02:36.500> might<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.829> bit<00:02:37.010> dubious<00:02:37.280> in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
Queen a5 idea might be a bit dubious in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.119 
Queen a5 idea might be a bit dubious in
this<00:02:38.329> position<00:02:38.780> maybe<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.439> castles<00:02:40.010> in

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
this position maybe just castles in

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.059 
this position maybe just castles in
Queen<00:02:40.340> c7<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> black<00:02:42.230> was<00:02:42.409> like<00:02:42.650> faffing

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
Queen c7 so black was like faffing

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.860 
Queen c7 so black was like faffing
around<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.519> queen<00:02:43.819> before<00:02:43.970> for<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:44.689> you

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
around and queen before for what you

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050 
around and queen before for what you
know<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:45.470> think<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.189> provocation<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
know I just think that provocation I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.819 
know I just think that provocation I
thought<00:02:47.239> I'd<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.510> smash<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:48.470> opponent

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
thought I'd just smash my opponent

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.910 
thought I'd just smash my opponent
through<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.099> center<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:50.560> course<00:02:51.560> I'm<00:02:51.739> not

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
through the center of course I'm not

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.089 
through the center of course I'm not
that<00:02:52.250> awake<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.450> was<00:02:53.870> very<00:02:54.109> overly

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
that awake and I was very overly

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.030 
that awake and I was very overly
optimistic<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.810> was<00:02:56.930> also<00:02:57.349> over<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
optimistic but I was also over the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.599 
optimistic but I was also over the
scared<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.659> apparent<00:02:59.889> solidity<00:03:00.889> here<00:03:01.310> which<00:03:01.459> i

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
scared of apparent solidity here which i

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.479 
scared of apparent solidity here which i
think<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.879> a<00:03:01.940> key<00:03:02.209> point<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.489> rejected

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
think is a key point because I rejected

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.129 
think is a key point because I rejected
in<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:05.150> position<00:03:07.299> what<00:03:08.299> ribka<00:03:08.659> thinks<00:03:08.900> is

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
in this position what ribka thinks is

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.490 
in this position what ribka thinks is
the<00:03:09.170> strongest<00:03:09.680> he<00:03:09.920> takes<00:03:10.250> d5<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.500> good

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
the strongest he takes d5 and good

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.110 
the strongest he takes d5 and good
because<00:03:12.709> basically<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.459> nutshell<00:03:13.489> after

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
because basically in a nutshell after

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.490 
because basically in a nutshell after
night<00:03:14.269> takes<00:03:14.569> d5<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.959> thought<00:03:15.260> black<00:03:15.470> was

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
night takes d5 I thought black was

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.170 
night takes d5 I thought black was
pretty<00:03:15.859> solid<00:03:16.250> with<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.609> night<00:03:16.819> you<00:03:17.060> know

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
pretty solid with that night you know

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.929 
pretty solid with that night you know

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
protected my two horns so that image of

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.939 
protected my two horns so that image of
solidity<00:03:20.359> was<00:03:20.629> there<00:03:22.269> however<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.989> wanted

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
solidity was there however so I wanted

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:25.960 
solidity was there however so I wanted
to<00:03:25.069> get<00:03:25.190> rid<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.609> night<00:03:25.790> because<00:03:25.879> I

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
thought be getting rid of the defensive

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.839 
thought be getting rid of the defensive
piece<00:03:27.470> but<00:03:27.739> I'm<00:03:27.829> getting<00:03:28.099> rid<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.250> my<00:03:28.459> very

dangerous start square piece by doing
that<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.370> played<00:03:31.669> Bishop<00:03:32.060> e7<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.769> after<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:33.919> I

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
that I played Bishop e7 and after this I

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.890 
that I played Bishop e7 and after this I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
with Knight takes d5 the problem is you

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.300 
with Knight takes d5 the problem is you
know<00:03:41.510> blacks<00:03:41.780> got<00:03:42.109> quite<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.470> few<00:03:42.739> attacking

concrete here not very young very
clear-cut<00:04:16.370> anyway<00:04:17.019> apparently<00:04:18.019> this<00:04:18.409> this

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
clear-cut anyway apparently this this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.649 
clear-cut anyway apparently this this
will<00:04:18.829> be<00:04:18.949> okay<00:04:19.190> for<00:04:19.250> white<00:04:19.549> according<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.030> okay

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
will be okay for white according to okay

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.830 
will be okay for white according to okay
here<00:04:21.109> but<00:04:21.289> this<00:04:21.380> isn't<00:04:21.739> exactly<00:04:22.479> convincing

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.420 

so<00:04:26.840> apparently<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.289> ideas<00:04:27.560> rook<00:04:27.770> takes<00:04:28.099> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
so apparently the ideas rook takes and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.159 
so apparently the ideas rook takes and
then<00:04:28.460> wrote<00:04:28.669> these<00:04:28.820> seven<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.690> why<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:29.930> should

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
then wrote these seven and why it should

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.110 
then wrote these seven and why it should
be<00:04:30.260> okay<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.279> it<00:04:31.400> should<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.610> deadly<00:04:31.969> cool

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
be okay so it should be deadly cool

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.010 
be okay so it should be deadly cool
maybe<00:04:32.300> there's<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> drawer

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
maybe there's a drawer

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.640 
maybe there's a drawer
you<00:04:33.110> see<00:04:33.349> check<00:04:34.270> Bush<00:04:35.270> v<00:04:35.479> 6<00:04:36.430> rook<00:04:37.430> takes<00:04:37.639> g7

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
you see check Bush v 6 rook takes g7

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.719 
you see check Bush v 6 rook takes g7
apparently<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.830> all<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.009> draw<00:04:40.340> for<00:04:40.400> some

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
apparently this is all a draw for some

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.379 
apparently this is all a draw for some
reason<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.240> means<00:04:41.449> is<00:04:41.720> getting<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.169> perpetual

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
reason that means is getting a perpetual

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.499 
reason that means is getting a perpetual
so<00:04:44.389> yeah<00:04:44.509> this<00:04:44.629> perpetual<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.550> even<00:04:46.970> even<00:04:47.120> them

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
so yeah this perpetual so even even them

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.990 
so yeah this perpetual so even even them
as<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.680> beautiful<00:04:49.069> continuations<00:04:49.669> get<00:04:49.909> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
as the beautiful continuations get the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.990 
as the beautiful continuations get the
petrol<00:04:50.449> but<00:04:51.139> certainly<00:04:51.560> not<00:04:51.740> wide<00:04:52.009> imagined

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
petrol but certainly not wide imagined

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.760 
petrol but certainly not wide imagined
from<00:04:53.240> earlier<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.520> all<00:04:55.729> went<00:04:55.940> um<00:04:56.590> tits<00:04:57.590> up

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
from earlier so it all went um tits up

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.040 
from earlier so it all went um tits up
basically<00:04:58.190> because<00:04:58.580> now<00:04:58.759> my<00:04:59.389> king<00:04:59.659> was<00:04:59.810> even

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
basically because now my king was even

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.869 
basically because now my king was even
exposed<00:05:00.409> when<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:00.889> played<00:05:01.280> bisciotti<00:05:01.580> for

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
exposed when I played bisciotti for

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.390 
exposed when I played bisciotti for
exposing<00:05:02.330> me<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.620> push<00:05:03.620> v6<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.099> that<00:05:04.250> was<00:05:04.340> the

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
exposing me to push v6 and that was the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.100 
exposing me to push v6 and that was the
end<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.669> game<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.090> quickly<00:05:05.330> had<00:05:06.080> a

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
end of the game so I quickly had a

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.439 
end of the game so I quickly had a
completely<00:05:06.560> lost<00:05:06.830> position<00:05:07.360> resigned<00:05:08.360> them

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
completely lost position resigned them

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.649 
completely lost position resigned them
move<00:05:08.599> 21<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:09.590> if<00:05:09.680> we<00:05:09.710> go<00:05:09.949> back<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:11.539> this

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
move 21 but if we go back to this

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.990

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000

looking at the concrete variations and

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.089 
looking at the concrete variations and
in<00:05:25.159> concrete<00:05:25.550> variations<00:05:26.349> on<00:05:27.349> me<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:28.039> a

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
in concrete variations on me this is a

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.620 
in concrete variations on me this is a
very<00:05:28.190> useful<00:05:28.520> attacking<00:05:29.060> resource<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.569> the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
very useful attacking resource and the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.540 
very useful attacking resource and the
dark<00:05:29.840> squares<00:05:30.169> why<00:05:30.710> give<00:05:30.949> it<00:05:31.039> up<00:05:31.219> for<00:05:31.430> that

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
dark squares why give it up for that

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.700 
dark squares why give it up for that
poxy<00:05:31.759> night<00:05:32.120> when<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:32.659> can<00:05:32.810> we<00:05:33.229> can<00:05:33.349> just<00:05:33.500> use

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
poxy night when you can we can just use

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.439 
poxy night when you can we can just use
the<00:05:33.830> rook<00:05:34.009> which<00:05:34.190> is<00:05:34.310> rechargeable<00:05:34.940> with<00:05:35.360> the

d5<00:05:39.409> would<00:05:39.620> have<00:05:39.710> been<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.889> way<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.039> do<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.310> to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
d5 would have been the way to do it to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.640 
d5 would have been the way to do it to
peel<00:05:41.210> open<00:05:41.360> blacks<00:05:41.870> position<00:05:41.960> now<00:05:42.380> queen

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
peel open blacks position now queen

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.570 
peel open blacks position now queen
takes<00:05:42.860> d5<00:05:43.310> it's<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.330> 8<00:05:44.539> +<00:05:44.719> f7<00:05:45.020> simultaneously<00:05:45.830> so

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
takes d5 it's a 8 + f7 simultaneously so

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.219 
takes d5 it's a 8 + f7 simultaneously so
blacks<00:05:46.819> force<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.210> console<00:05:47.599> lose<00:05:47.750> material

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
blacks force the console lose material

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.249 
blacks force the console lose material
here<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:49.210> there's<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.270> very<00:05:50.810> tactical

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
here and there's a very tactical

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.890 
here and there's a very tactical
continuation<00:05:51.979> of<00:05:52.039> course<00:05:52.310> which<00:05:52.940> any

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
continuation of course which any

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.379 
continuation of course which any
computers<00:05:54.469> could<00:05:54.620> bring<00:05:55.370> up<00:05:55.520> with<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.210> idea

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
computers could bring up with this idea

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.240 
computers could bring up with this idea
Bishop<00:05:56.930> a<00:05:57.020> 62<00:05:57.409> f<00:05:57.529> 1<00:05:57.740> it's<00:05:57.860> ridiculous<00:06:00.250> potato

Bishop a 62 f 1 it's ridiculous potato

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.870 
Bishop a 62 f 1 it's ridiculous potato
with<00:06:01.550> we're<00:06:02.419> here<00:06:02.569> with<00:06:02.690> Bishop<00:06:03.050> d5<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:04.729> this

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
with we're here with Bishop d5 so this

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.999 
with we're here with Bishop d5 so this
strange<00:06:05.210> variation<00:06:05.779> and<00:06:06.259> sort<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.740> certain

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
strange variation and sort of certain

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.390 
strange variation and sort of certain
depth<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.460> my<00:06:08.270> it's<00:06:08.389> much<00:06:08.569> better<00:06:09.310> but<00:06:10.310> the

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
depth and my it's much better but the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.610 
depth and my it's much better but the
key<00:06:10.580> learning<00:06:10.940> point<00:06:11.180> for<00:06:11.360> me<00:06:11.449> was<00:06:11.590> yeah<00:06:12.590> this

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
key learning point for me was yeah this

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.040 
key learning point for me was yeah this
