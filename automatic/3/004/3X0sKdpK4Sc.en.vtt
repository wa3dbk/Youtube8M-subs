liquidy today because I don't think I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.820 
liquidy today because I don't think I
fed<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.370> properly<00:02:33.880> yesterday<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:35.590> I'm<00:02:35.709> going

fed it properly yesterday now I'm going
to<00:02:35.890> take<00:02:36.100> my<00:02:36.310> oldish<00:02:36.760> sour<00:02:37.060> dough<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:39.489> just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
to take my oldish sour dough and just

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.020 
to take my oldish sour dough and just
pop<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.390> there<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.220> that's<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.459> lot<00:02:42.760> I'm

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
pop it in there and that's a lot I'm

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.770
