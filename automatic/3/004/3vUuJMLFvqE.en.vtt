00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
pretty terrific as you can see by

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.080 
pretty terrific as you can see by
looking<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.840> leads<00:01:01.609> they<00:01:02.609> do

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
looking at some of these leads they do

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
looking at some of these leads they do
have<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.809> virus<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.470> sort<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.189> kind<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the disease I'm not sure which one it is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.060 
the disease I'm not sure which one it is
yet<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.900> many<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.740> affect

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
yet but there are many that can affect

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
yet but there are many that can affect
beans<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> area<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.500> quite

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
beans and in this area it's quite

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.719 
beans and in this area it's quite
prevalent<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:16.009> usually<00:01:17.009> spray<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.610> an

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
prevalent I usually spray with an

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
prevalent I usually spray with an
organic<00:01:18.090> fungicides

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
organic fungicides

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
organic fungicides
but<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> wasn't<00:01:20.100> feeling<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.610> during<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
but I wasn't feeling well during this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
but I wasn't feeling well during this
time<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.500> neglected<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
time and so I really neglected them I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.469 
time and so I really neglected them I
think<00:01:23.369> otherwise<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.299> been

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
think otherwise they would have been

first harvest with them and they I think
if<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.120> compare<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.780> two<00:02:15.000> from<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> initial

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
if I compare the two from this initial

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.390 
if I compare the two from this initial
harvest<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.680> only<00:02:18.370> got<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.970> third<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
harvest I only got about a third of a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.460 
harvest I only got about a third of a
colander<00:02:21.819> full<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.780> big<00:02:26.110> difference

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
colander full which is a big difference

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.890
