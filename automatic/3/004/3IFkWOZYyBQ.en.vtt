 how does a car from the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 most important American industry 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 The man who drew the designer drew 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.890
 coca cola bottle has been designed for 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 the shell logo and the lucky strike 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.380
 packaging is responsible to everyone 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 case unlike ordinary automobiles 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 magath on four wheels 1963 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 porsche presents the 911 lamborghini 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 the 350 gt and chevrolet corvette 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 stingray as a competitor develops this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160
 American companies baker that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.440
 sport coupe avanti the usa is swinging 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.360
 in autobau at unprecedented heights 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 competitor chevrolet produces in the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.550
 cut 10,000 cars a day 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.650
 but so the baker is in the crisis 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 the cars are American 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.240
 clientele too compact and so on 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.380
 Progressively the paragraph stops 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.600
 raymond loewy the american 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.820
 industrial designer par excellence stands 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.250
 the new avanti the image-worthy 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.119
 Sports car should be the company from the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.670
 bring crisis 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.950
 the wallauer president from the swiss 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.729
 studebaker club is still big today 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.860
 admiration for the design pioneer levy 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.460
 that was always his motto 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.820
 slightly windy little consumption 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.380
 and beautiful cars sold ugliness 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.380
 Bad that was his claim 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.299
 whether the avanti really is beautiful lies 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 Unusual in the eye of the observer 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.500
 the lines especially considering 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.810
 that the avanti already 63 on the market 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.789
 you have to get involved with the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.950
 avant-garde shape and details 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.520
 then opens up to the viewer the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.409
 work let itself be the rear view becomes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.090
 with the huge rear window and the mix 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.709
 from straight and curved lines 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.950
 unusual single-seated round instruments 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.170
 manual control and simple ambience 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 at that time unusual for a usk man 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.380
 he imagines himself in a luxurious 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.380
 French or Italian 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 the light-flooded interior offers 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 club atmosphere and enough space for 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.440
 Four adults also that one exception 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.440
 for a 60s coupe 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.459
 the avanti has security 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.689
 features like an integrated one 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.310
 roll bar 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.769
 because the body consists of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.980
 polyester the then state-of-the-art 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.629
 material is being processed in 1963 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.540
 but still difficulties like polyester 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.180
 Quality was not very good at the time 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.629
 You have problems with tearing the lacquers 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.920
 tear and that means a heightened 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.920
 the mouth type 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.900
 when driving behavior you can not 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.000
 to set today's standards 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.220
 Although the avanti has power like 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.860
 a buffalo disc brakes and a good one 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.690
 aerodynamics in fast driven curves 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.100
 but the pilots but then but old 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.230
 and origin conscious 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.020
 Nevertheless, the plastic coupé is called 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.700
 not wrongly avanti on the straight 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.920
 The ami is good for a bit of over 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.500
 200 if you dare 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.120
 but who would like with such a stylish 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.140
 Coupe already with top speed 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.750
 to bring over the track 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.030
 at the beginning of the 60s, the wall is considered the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.130
 serious sports car and poses 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.459
 on salt see speed records 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.459
 on 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.300
 what has saved over is 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.570
 relatively light weight and a lot of power 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.360
 a lot of scary services like this 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.610
 has charged a lot here 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.370
 stronger and is actually considered the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.950
 first mask of the name ever 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.690
 to earn 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.410
 Of course, a avanti has a v8 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.450
 4 7 liters and 240 horses strong 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.600
 you choose the compressor certain 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.030
 variant makes the engine 335 hp 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.220
 then the avanti must step on one 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.940
 power steering at least in the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.910
 first model year 1964 runs the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.160
 production after 4600 pieces of two 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.990
 Years later, the debeka is final 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.850
 broke that is already the whole 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.630
 story of this extraordinary 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.450
 be coupés 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.490
 not quite two former dealers buy 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.500
 the production equipment and build the 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.610
 avanti with chevrolet technology up to the middle 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.890
 the 90s 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.680
 but a proof of the timeless design 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.510
 raymond loewy who is looking for you today 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.980
