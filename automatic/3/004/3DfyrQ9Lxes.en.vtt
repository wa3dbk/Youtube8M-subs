00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.410
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.309
 found for a new tutorial on the 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.710
 makeup cake 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.320
 so we will start by doing a 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.669
 small palette of eye shadow so 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.800
 you need for a cookie cutter 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.110
 square if you do not have one you do 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 to contours it works as well 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.080
 then we will make four small 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.910
 find me I took a double behind 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.110
 a socket 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 if you do not have to import piece 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.450
 it's perfect - it was good 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 size that I wanted to have 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.780
 then once you have you have 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 take these little circles you go 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 take two-colored sugar dough 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.990
 different colors you want and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.310
 with the same double you discover the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.330
 little circles as you move to 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.330
 inside the holes 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.040
 me what I advise you is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 to use at least for the parties 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.150
 black gum goes out she will be 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 easier to work she will sit 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 faster and it's really more 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 practice of using it to make 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 little props like earth is going to have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.850
 need to move and know it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850
 fast enough 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.290
 then we'll do the little thing 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.380
 brush to go with the blushes to 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.680
 eyelids makes you a little bit of 1 2 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.880
 as a black pastor 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 you're going to put a little bit a little bit 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.190
 more pointed and then you make a 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.690
 little white ball that will come to make 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.360
 the end of your brush and you 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.360
 come and stick it against the mother boat 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.629
 then we will make the brush the big one 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.180
 brush to blue as you want so there 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.980
 we make a black sausage roll with 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.590
 a little more important at the level of the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.299
 size and so at the end we will come 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.629
 to do the bristles 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.819
 you take like sugar paste from 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.250
 slightly Belgian colors 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.269
 you will do a little bit of a bit 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.730
 a little flared and then with a 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.969
 earlier you will draw the features 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.480
 brush to make it more 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.480
 realistic 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.950
 then so here I decided to make a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 little buzz so simple to anyone 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.670
 the pieces will you take a second 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.290
 the carried part of the size below 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:30.690
 is a hole in the middle take your dough 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.930
 to sugar because of the sahara and you 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 so take the import piece a little bit more 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.030
 small you go in the center 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.470
 then we'll do the red 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.440
 lipstick lips this is what is 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.450
 a little bit more technical so 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.459
 really to make it realistic 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.190
 you have to make a little pudding and you have to 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.110
 flatten one end you see that on 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.739
 a lipstick there is one of the sides that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.440
 is who and punch is actually received must 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.860
 to be a shot ben there that you go 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.069
 wrapped around your party 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.069
 red 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.500
 and you have what exceeds 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.660
 then to make the base of red 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.340
 lipstick so there with the help of a wall 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.889
 sugar impact I give it a shape 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.199
 square if ever you have not said will be 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.870
 you did not do that with anything 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.550
 a carton as long as these places there 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.880
 will work well to find 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.729
 carey side is then so you adjust 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.190
 and you put the first part under 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.530
 the second part with a little bit 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.910
 of water and you have a red is so there 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.590
 we're going to do a lipstick so here 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.449
 you take the same excuse so with the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.810
 Sugar smoother or a neighborhood if 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.539
 you do not have to give yourself a shape 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.930
 rectangle this time with a 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.630
 width a little less important and you 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.080
 m trying to do the rather large 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.320
 the same 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.310
 a small sausage with a size month 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.610
 for above that you place your ass 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.560
 brush then so you see for 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.150
 to make the cake race one has to take 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.610
 a cake or cut to 3/4 a share 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.110
 and you put us on slice 2 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.630
 to make this rounded shape of 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.490
 makeup bag or afterwards you 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.990
 gamache is so often I used 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.460
 a classic nutella butter cream 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.849
 not that it is vain persecution good 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.979
 cake 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.020
 then we cover with sugar paste or 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.840
 as usual kneading in the dough to 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.699
 sugar and icing sugar on full 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.370
 work so that it does not bother and my 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:52.620
 so our paw ensures then we 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.080
 will cover our cake with dough to 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.940
 sugar there so delicately because 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.760
 it's true with 700 lasses a little more 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.520
 delicate of their confreres so then 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.500
 there is the embossing of your little 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.240
 makeup bag or less I 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.490
 do with a square with a ruler 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.780
 have arrived at a simon with on the back 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.510
 of a man rather it works very 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.610
 well we make small lozenges sarr 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.159
 had been a bit my class and so 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.780
 then walk with the help of an extract of 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.080
 flap ensures that I made small 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.940
 the little pink pudding I'm not 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.870
 regular sim is not to exclude after 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.250
 you assume it's not serious 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.610
 a party to the same it works very 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.610
 cautious 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.950
 concert the seams made of the bag 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.440
 then I have a little logo 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.980
 everyone knows well to do the 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.290
 side a little luxury cake so there 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.180
 we will realize the closure of the bag 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:56.020
 so you are a ribbon of sugar dough 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.390
 - in the middle a first dia transit so 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.950
 with a small tool you've seen otherwise 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.510
 make headbands it will be a little less 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.650
 realistic there it is true that it is 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.300
 really the perfect tool to do that 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:15.730
 and so we follow with a small knife 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:20.980
 you will do everything from there you have 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:26.230
 really a very realistic closure the 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.940
 zip a convenient kit 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.830
 make-up 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.650
 then you're going to put it on the 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:37.990
 above your cake and a place where 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.910
 the right side here I hope this tutorial 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.790
 you liked it so here is the result of the 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.530
 finished cake offers you to find
