31<00:01:09.220> by<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.430> second<00:01:09.759> half<00:01:09.910> so<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.360> think<00:01:10.570> that's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
31 by the second half so I think that's

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.450 
31 by the second half so I think that's
pretty<00:01:10.930> legit<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.560> don't<00:01:11.950> know<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.190> second

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
pretty legit I don't know that second

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.279 
pretty legit I don't know that second
half<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.119> what<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.390> thing<00:01:13.570> said<00:01:13.810> so

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
half but this is what that thing said so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.779 
half but this is what that thing said so
check<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.649> out<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.130> don't<00:01:15.520> know<00:01:15.610> what

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
check this out I don't know what

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.070 
check this out I don't know what
happened<00:01:16.119> right<00:01:16.270> here<00:01:16.300> but<00:01:16.630> we<00:01:16.720> breaking

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
happened right here but we breaking

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.440 
happened right here but we breaking
ankles<00:01:17.289> that<00:01:17.680> we<00:01:17.770> take<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.190> crazy<00:01:18.610> fade<00:01:19.090> away

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
ankles that we take in a crazy fade away

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.830
