00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.399
 let me ask you a quick question 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 when you heard on facebook the first 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.500
 time to how many people did you tell them 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.330
 were 10 20 30 people and you want to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.919
 twitter or instagram or even angry 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.870
 birds if you're like the average of 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.820
 people maybe something similar happened to this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 you had a very good experience with 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.730
 a new product or service 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 so you decided to tell a lot of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.780
 your friends fans or followers for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 facilitate this example assume that 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.410
 you only chose seven people and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 each one these people got excited and what 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 they shared with seven of their friends 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 those friends began to share it with 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 their friends and so continued to grow like 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
 that when you red a stone in a lake 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.060
 quiet that little movement that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.860
 you created at the beginning it starts to 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.079
 take over the lake full and shape 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 very fast is what we call it a 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 first wave effect 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 seven people to whom you said it 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 they turned in 49 for the second wave 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.899
 expansive 743 people for their third 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 wave 2.401 on your fourth wave and for the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.720
 fifth your news had already reached 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.180
 More than 16,000 people 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.710
 continues to expand further this is only 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.540
 assuming you chose seven people 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.120
 imagine the size of the shock wave 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.620
 that you created the last time you 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.170
 loved a product or service that 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.000
 you proved incredible the amount of 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.160
 income that this generates without knowing it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.260
 these companies still yes you knew 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.870
 in that moment you created a wave 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.030
 expansive huge this type of marketing 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.620
 viral is what has made the owners of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.720
 facebook instagram 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.120
 and angry birds and many other companies 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.370
 it is known is very very rich but that 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.350
 I want to say it was you who helped 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.610
 to spread the message you do not have 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.320
 curiosity to know how many people 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.700
 they came to that company because you 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.100
 you started an expansive 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.260
 recommendations that it would not be fair that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.820
 you will receive fair compensation for 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.950
 the huge number of people who 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 you took just imagine what it would have 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.660
 past if a game like the river would have 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.250
 paid 50 cents to a dollar each time 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.200
 that someone in all the expansive will lodge 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.720
 how much money would you have earned only 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.360
 sharing that game now think 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.710
 how many games apps and how many websites 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.840
 your friends and you have shared in the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.430
 last months it does not sound very fair 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.810
 you are the one doing all the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 marketing and sales for these 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.080
 companies 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.819
 they are the ones who are doing hundreds 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.490
 of millions or thousands of even millions 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.490
 of dollars thanks to your efforts what 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.900
 is what you get, nothing good is something of 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.270
 time we consider this same 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.130
 question first when I started a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.780
 expansive wave that reaches so far and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.400
 second because I 'm not getting 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.110
 no type of payment for the effect of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 expansive that I am generating for these 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.680
 companies these two questions we 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 they left without sleep for many nights and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 after that they used a great eye 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 then curiosity and finally emotion 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 and that's why we created rethink a 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.459
 simple way not only to know what is 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.820
 happening with respect where expansive 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.739
 but also to receive money from it 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.870
 let me show you how they work first 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.160
 download the plan app then invite 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
 let your friends and followers do what 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.880
 same while they do the same 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.350
 we will show you how deep 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.870
 and so far is the shockwave that 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.760
 you are creating in this way where you are 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.830
 literally expanding around the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 world and this is where I said the real 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.340
 fun especially if all the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.959
 money that is being generated to angry 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.910
 birds thanks to all the people that you 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.739
 You send yourself upset because you see that 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.079
 you register in retail you can 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.250
 Become a player players know 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.079
 what is to save from the expansive waves 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.329
 that they are creating since they are receiving 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.400
 compensation for everything that happens 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.079
 in them just imagine and every time 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.810
 you will find something that you will like 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.459
 a website a book or a movie or the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.380
 next time a very popular app 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.540
 was thrown instead of telling your 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.100
 friends and generals of companies millions 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 of dollars while you do not gain anything 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.090
 just check or if they are eligible 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.549
 for front commissions and if you could 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 send them across the length and width of all your 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.120
 expansive wave generating commissions each 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.370
 once they did it does not sound great 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.290
 because the plan we believe should be 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.540
 compensated for the connections you have 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.060
 and the expansive effect that you can create 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.590
 that's how it must be so you're 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.730
 waiting for food your first wave 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.730
 expansive now
