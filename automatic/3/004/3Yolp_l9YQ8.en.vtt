00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
held in by a Velcro you can't see it but

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.820 
held in by a Velcro you can't see it but
maybe<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.780> make<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.560> hear
