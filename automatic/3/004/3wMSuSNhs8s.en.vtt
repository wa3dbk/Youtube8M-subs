possible which brings you to my next
topic<00:02:40.900> which<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.290> prioritizing<00:02:42.280> your<00:02:42.310> enemies

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
topic which is prioritizing your enemies

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.390 
topic which is prioritizing your enemies
obviously<00:02:43.930> anyone<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.380> gun<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:45.040> number

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
obviously anyone with a gun is number

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.759 
obviously anyone with a gun is number
one<00:02:45.549> priority<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.420> second<00:02:47.170> would<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:47.470> anyone

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
one priority and second would be anyone

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.759 
one priority and second would be anyone
with<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.130> baton<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.930> had<00:02:50.110> electric

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
with like a baton that had electric

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.199 
with like a baton that had electric
charge<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.220> or<00:02:51.489> anyone<00:02:51.790> with<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> knife

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
charge on it or anyone with a knife

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.390 
charge on it or anyone with a knife
they're<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:52.989> lot<00:02:53.230> harder<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.650> take<00:02:53.830> down<00:02:53.890> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
they're a lot harder to take down and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.280 
they're a lot harder to take down and
you<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.880> use<00:02:55.090> special<00:02:55.540> moves<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.930> do<00:02:56.080> that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you have to use special moves to do that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
you have to use special moves to do that
so<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.830> will<00:02:56.920> try<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.220> take<00:02:57.430> them<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:57.880> fast

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so I will try to take them out as fast

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.229 
so I will try to take them out as fast
as<00:02:58.299> possible<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.549> big<00:03:00.549> thing<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.030> game

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
as possible so big thing about this game

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.350 
as possible so big thing about this game
is<00:03:01.450> your<00:03:01.840> timing<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.560> use<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.549> easy<00:03:03.790> mode<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
is your timing I use the easy mode of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360 
is your timing I use the easy mode of
this<00:03:04.510> game<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:05.019> show<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.260> how<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.620> time<00:03:06.100> my

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
this game to show you how I time my

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.090 
this game to show you how I time my
counters<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.180> prioritize<00:03:08.049> my<00:03:08.290> moves<00:03:08.590> off<00:03:08.859> of

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
counters and prioritize my moves off of

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.789 
counters and prioritize my moves off of
that<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.720> hard<00:03:11.049> mode<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.410> won't<00:03:11.620> have

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
that and on the hard mode you won't have

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.099 
that and on the hard mode you won't have
that<00:03:11.859> but<00:03:12.670> hopefully<00:03:13.030> by<00:03:13.180> then<00:03:13.359> you're<00:03:13.750> pretty

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
that but hopefully by then you're pretty

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.410 
that but hopefully by then you're pretty
familiar<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.820> they're<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.269> hit

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
familiar with when they're going to hit

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.270 
familiar with when they're going to hit
you<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.660> stuff<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.470> you'll<00:03:18.070> see

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
about incorporating every move into a

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.840 
about incorporating every move into a
combo<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:32.019> particular<00:03:32.799> scene<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.549> I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850
