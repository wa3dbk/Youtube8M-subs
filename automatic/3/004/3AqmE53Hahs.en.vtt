00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
kind of day by day kind of thing you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.730 
kind of day by day kind of thing you
know<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.520> get<00:01:40.450> used<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.719> your<00:01:40.810> body<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.259> you

know the insulin doses that you do so
you<00:01:44.320> kind<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.799> want<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.579> have<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:45.969> think<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
you kind of want to have it I think the

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.779 
you kind of want to have it I think the
more<00:01:46.479> control<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.140> over<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.500> and

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
more control you can have over it and

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.950 
more control you can have over it and
you<00:01:48.789> know<00:01:48.820> if<00:01:49.030> you're<00:01:49.270> having<00:01:49.390> activity<00:01:49.750> and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you know if you're having activity and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.240 
you know if you're having activity and
stuff<00:01:50.109> like<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.289> usually<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.950> reduce

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
stuff like that usually you reduce

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.980 
stuff like that usually you reduce
insulin<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.820> sometimes<00:01:52.539> give<00:01:52.719> yourself<00:01:52.930> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
insulin it sometimes give yourself a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.029 
insulin it sometimes give yourself a
little<00:01:53.020> more<00:01:53.229> sugar<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.619> make<00:01:53.710> sure<00:01:53.859> you<00:01:53.950> don't

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
little more sugar to make sure you don't

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.980 
little more sugar to make sure you don't
crash<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.609> go<00:01:54.670> low<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.210> yeah<00:01:55.630> I've<00:01:55.840> been

crash and go low so yeah I've been

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.510 
crash and go low so yeah I've been
living<00:01:56.109> with<00:01:56.320> with<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.070> for<00:01:57.219> quite<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.399> while

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
living with with it for quite a while

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.920 
living with with it for quite a while
now<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:57.939> kind<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.180> get<00:01:58.299> used<00:01:58.329> to<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.659> it's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
now and just kind of get used to it it's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.070 
now and just kind of get used to it it's
kind<00:01:59.109> of<00:01:59.229> there<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.680> don't

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
kind of there and you don't

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.690 
kind of there and you don't
worry<00:02:00.290> about<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.590> too<00:02:00.710> much<00:02:00.740> because<00:02:01.100> you've

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
worry about it too much because you've

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.390 
worry about it too much because you've
had<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.480> for<00:02:02.510> so<00:02:02.720> long<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.320> think<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:04.340> know

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
had it for so long so I think you know

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.710 
had it for so long so I think you know
it<00:02:04.430> hasn't<00:02:04.640> really<00:02:04.820> hindered<00:02:05.150> me<00:02:05.300> anyway<00:02:05.690> and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it hasn't really hindered me anyway and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.360 
it hasn't really hindered me anyway and
playing<00:02:06.380> hockey<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.830> stuff<00:02:07.040> like<00:02:07.160> that<00:02:07.250> so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
playing hockey and stuff like that so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.580 
playing hockey and stuff like that so
it's<00:02:07.730> one<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.720> those<00:02:08.780> things<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.440> have

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
it's one of those things that you have

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.680
