there's<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.330> drag<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.140> know<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.470> not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
there's a little drag you know it's not

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.340 
there's a little drag you know it's not
it's<00:02:17.980> kind<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.280> um<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:20.020> want<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> say

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
it's kind of um I don't want to say

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's kind of um I don't want to say
sticky<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> compare<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
sticky but when I compare it to the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.770 
sticky but when I compare it to the
benefit<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.370> bright<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.120> eyebright<00:02:25.420> feels<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
benefit I bright the eyebright feels a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020 
benefit I bright the eyebright feels a
little<00:02:25.900> smoother<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> feel<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
little smoother so I feel like this the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.750 
little smoother so I feel like this the
benefit<00:02:28.510> blend<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.620> easier<00:02:30.460> than

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
benefit blend out a little easier than

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.170 
benefit blend out a little easier than
the<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.110> elf<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:32.620> does<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.880> know<00:02:34.000> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the the elf one does but you know it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.760 
the the elf one does but you know it's
very<00:02:35.430> slight<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.820> that's<00:02:37.570> one<00:02:37.810> thing<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
very slight so that's one thing the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.460 
very slight so that's one thing the
coloring<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.990> actually<00:02:41.740> use<00:02:42.220> these<00:02:42.700> both<00:02:43.000> today

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
coloring I actually use these both today

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860 
coloring I actually use these both today
as<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:45.190> highlight<00:02:45.820> color<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:46.390> my<00:02:46.480> eye<00:02:46.510> shadow

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
as a highlight color for my eye shadow

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.310 
as a highlight color for my eye shadow
this<00:02:47.650> side<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.540> side<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.260> elf<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:52.320> this

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
this side the side has the elf and this

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.060 
this side the side has the elf and this
side<00:02:54.000> has<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.030> eyebright<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.900> there's<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
side has the eyebright and there's you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.620 
side has the eyebright and there's you
know<00:02:57.100> what<00:02:57.459> I'm<00:02:57.550> looking<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> mirror<00:02:58.030> again

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
know what I'm looking in a mirror again

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.360 
know what I'm looking in a mirror again
there's<00:02:59.110> very<00:02:59.410> subtle<00:02:59.770> difference<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.160> can't

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
there's very subtle difference I can't

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.060 
there's very subtle difference I can't
really<00:03:00.520> tell<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.600> difference<00:03:01.630> between<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
really tell the difference between the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.470 
really tell the difference between the
two<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.620> elf<00:03:05.830> one<00:03:06.040> also<00:03:06.459> has<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:07.000> brow

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
two the elf one also has this brow

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.150 
two the elf one also has this brow
pencil<00:03:07.959> on<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.200> other<00:03:08.320> end<00:03:08.530> which<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:08.950> really

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
pencil on the other end which is really

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.030 
pencil on the other end which is really
nice<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.700> use<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.330> every<00:03:11.140> single<00:03:11.260> day<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.620> fill

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
nice I use this every single day to fill

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.160 
nice I use this every single day to fill
in<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> little<00:03:13.180> spot<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.570> my<00:03:13.780> eyebrows

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
in have a little spot in my eyebrows

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.949 
in have a little spot in my eyebrows
that<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.470> fill<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:16.090> use<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.660> every<00:03:16.930> day

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that I fill in and I use this every day

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.130 
that I fill in and I use this every day
so<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.260> think<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.330> good<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.900> and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
so I think it's really good for that and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.620 
so I think it's really good for that and
because<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.950> has<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.370> chevron<00:03:21.910> arthéon<00:03:22.299> it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
because it has a chevron arthéon it

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.479 
because it has a chevron arthéon it
makes<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.900> really<00:03:23.019> convenient<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.890> if<00:03:24.250> you

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
makes it really convenient so if you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.310 
makes it really convenient so if you
were<00:03:24.580> ever<00:03:24.760> thinking<00:03:25.090> about<00:03:25.209> trying<00:03:25.540> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
were ever thinking about trying the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.289 
were ever thinking about trying the
eyebright<00:03:26.739> by<00:03:26.890> benefit<00:03:27.400> why<00:03:27.910> don't<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.150> give

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
eyebright by benefit why don't you give

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.420 
eyebright by benefit why don't you give
the<00:03:28.480> elf<00:03:28.630> wanna<00:03:28.840> try<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.320> some<00:03:29.920> totally<00:03:30.280> worth

one up just because i needed an eyebrow
pencil<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:12.400> benefit<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.150> was

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
pencil and the benefit of that was

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.449 
pencil and the benefit of that was
having<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.049> little<00:04:14.290> lifter<00:04:14.739> on<00:04:15.010> there<00:04:15.250> too

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
having that little lifter on there too

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.659 
having that little lifter on there too

it's really great for doing an under

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.510 
it's really great for doing an under
brow<00:04:18.669> highlight<00:04:18.989> instead<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.019> using<00:04:20.520> an

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
brow highlight instead of using an

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.580 
brow highlight instead of using an
eyeshadow<00:04:21.729> if<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.270> don't<00:04:22.419> want<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.720> sometimes

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590
