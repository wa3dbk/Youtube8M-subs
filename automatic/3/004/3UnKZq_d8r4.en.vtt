avenge<00:02:04.340> actually<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.580> that's<00:02:05.850> compatible

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
avenge actually think that's compatible

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
avenge actually think that's compatible
with<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.200> scope<00:02:07.979> isn't<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.429> I'm<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:08.850> sure

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
with the scope isn't it I'm pretty sure

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.530 
with the scope isn't it I'm pretty sure
it<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:10.310> third<00:02:11.310> game<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.790> Tasmania<00:02:14.540> slightly

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it is a third game is Tasmania slightly

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.729 
it is a third game is Tasmania slightly
different<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:17.870> rocket<00:02:18.870> down<00:02:19.049> there<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
different to the rocket down there the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.770 
different to the rocket down there the
Tasmanian<00:02:20.579> devil<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> Mega<00:02:21.360> Drive<00:02:21.600> I

Tasmanian devil on the Mega Drive I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.060 
Tasmanian devil on the Mega Drive I
thought<00:02:21.989> it'd<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.260> quite<00:02:22.440> similar<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:22.829> it's

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
thought it'd be quite similar but it's

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.220 
thought it'd be quite similar but it's
