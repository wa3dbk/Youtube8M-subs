00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 watts everyone is christ 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.260
 However, today we feel the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.610
 breaking news excuse me if I have a little 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 the cup at paul phoenix 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.299
 if you know a little tekken and well 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.400
 it's a bit the case nowadays game 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.690
 that's all we see happening with the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 information just before the football is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 here to put down the screen and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 well my personal snap if you want 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.300
 tell me everything send me small 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
 stages of titles like that and if you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.630
 have questions do not hesitate 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.560
 really not I'm here and I 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 thanks all the people who 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.260
 also send me a snap 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 Yeah that makes me extremely happy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 today we will also talk so 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 still this famous dlc arm paprec age 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.579
 excuse me but casino in fact I 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.870
 also thought at the same time robbery 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.170
 because it's going to be really a sequel 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.809
 two big dlc and we could have a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 little extra information then 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.960
 official unfortunately but that's 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.660
 perfect mw2 as I say them 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.829
 previously actually that person 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.469
 had given a lot of information by 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.899
 example on the dlc robbery and we will 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.520
 say that 95% or almost 100% of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.719
 this information was true it is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.219
 true that it really leaves us in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.840
 doubt that there he begins to speak a little 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.129
 of this casino dlc like this is it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.689
 getting in shape and that he 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.630
 could see it we'll say a little bit in the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.970
 gta game databases and he was able to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 to see some things from which 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 example the possible end in the future 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.250
 when this dlc will appear there will be four 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 big categories that will be present 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.150
 and me too would be something 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 quite strange because both were 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
 can notice a lot of casino in 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 the game f1 which one which is huge and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 it's true that it's actually closed 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 It's entirely possible 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 in any case I think it's all 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 it's possible that we will see 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 in fact finally and well a dlc on the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.329
 casino simply that's it then there is 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.159
 four big categories some when 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 you go to the end casino in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.320
 the future when the dlc will be open on 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.850
 the way there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.350
 open a little to all audiences and when 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.700
 people will be able to enter a casino 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.050
 they can do four things 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.640
 apparently for now it's all 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.990
 who was told that you will have the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.040
 opportunity to do poker I you 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.240
 gave the rules maybe that 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.320
 some people know the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.580
 rules and where I just wanted to give 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.409
 like that you will know 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.670
 basically poker is a game family 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.200
 many cards 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.190
 formulas and variants it is practiced 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.250
 several players with a game 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.780
 usually 52 cards and tokens 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.130
 representing the sum bet is a little 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.110
 poker as a way to convoys all 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 simply and well down the td and where 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.930
 when there are some chips and where he 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 have to bet sums is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.780
 we can lose everything so if we have to 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.480
 know what it can be very risky 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.670
 to do some poker games on 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.530
 is also the black jack in fact so the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.890
 part rests all the players against the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.239
 bank 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.160
 the goal is to beat the group there is 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.050
 without exceeding 21 as soon as a player makes 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.489
 more than 21 years old says he jumps or 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.209
 they die and he loses his stake 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.430
 initial 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.870
 so we end up a little bit here it is 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.910
 different rules but a little bit in 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.220
 even if rouen beats you can lose everything 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.810
 we have roulette so here it's a game 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 this is my opinion it will really be the game 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.540
 who will interest me at most who is a 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.550
 a game of chance in which 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.470
 each player to sochaux so so 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.660
 around a gaming table but on one or 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.220
 several numbers one color the height 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.910
 where the parity of the number he hopes to be 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.769
 withdrawn 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.080
 you know it's shooting makes it the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.910
 little ball that will launch and that's it 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.829
 simply roulette like we 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.880
 say it and then hope to fall 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.100
 on the right number 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.600
 we are the only lot then the slot 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.600
 run out of steam show so in my 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.370
 previous dlc video at the casino level 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.690
 which is just the fact that's it if you 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.100
 know it's so they call you 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.170
 exactly the machines or the players 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.410
 put a coin and raised one by one 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.480
 the old ones simply that it's the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.310
 where there are with the machines and where we 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 can hope to win but that costs 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910
 much cheaper necessarily will bet 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.739
 a lot less money but we have 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.709
 much more likely to lose 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.730
 at the level of games so it's pretty much 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.810
 near all for now at the level of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.130
 information with four big 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.209
 categorically frankly what you 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.040
 think all saints in the share of 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.170
 comments me there are two games that 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.610
 interest me spot and roulette in 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.860
 hoping it will be available and 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.080
 well in this future dlc we do not have 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.070
 other information unfortunately 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.270
 after that it's really a maybe 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.740
 take it lightly but at once 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.960
 that it's not anyone who's us 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.920
 say ah and then thank you to all 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.330
 young people to put a little sick jet 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.620
 two it's great fun so if that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 personal calm me that I tell you to the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.880
 next tchatcho pissos
