actually<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.270> very

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
actually because it's a it's a very

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.249 
actually because it's a it's a very
short<00:02:00.990> maturing<00:02:02.570> quick<00:02:03.570> maturing<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> should

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
short maturing quick maturing I should

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.000 
short maturing quick maturing I should
say<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.560> very

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
say and very

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.340 
say and very
short<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.190> height<00:02:06.400> plan<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:08.050> still<00:02:08.229> has

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
short and height plan and it still has

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.020 
short and height plan and it still has
delicious<00:02:08.649> fruit<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.280> all<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.490> great<00:02:09.970> stuff

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
delicious fruit and all this great stuff

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.970 
delicious fruit and all this great stuff
so<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.720> was<00:02:10.840> developed<00:02:11.260> at<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.380> University<00:02:11.890> of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
so it was developed at the University of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940 
so it was developed at the University of
Florida<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.460> Bradenton<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:14.440> guys<00:02:14.620> at<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
Florida and Bradenton my guys at the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.920 
Florida and Bradenton my guys at the
Utah<00:02:15.550> State<00:02:15.610> University<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:16.510> tested<00:02:16.870> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
Utah State University have tested it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.220 
Utah State University have tested it
extensively<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:19.300> excited<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.750> try<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:19.990> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
extensively and I'm excited to try it I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.840 
extensively and I'm excited to try it I
didn't<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.740> didn't<00:02:21.160> really<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.460> time<00:02:21.550> to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
didn't I didn't really have the time to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.450 
didn't I didn't really have the time to
try<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.990> summer<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.160> really<00:02:24.370> don't

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
try it this summer and I really don't

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.060 
try it this summer and I really don't
think<00:02:24.580> I'm<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.120> super<00:02:25.510> optimistic<00:02:25.870> about<00:02:26.170> how

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
think I'm not super optimistic about how

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.680 
think I'm not super optimistic about how
it's<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.430> do<00:02:27.550> here<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.150> middle<00:02:28.570> of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
it's going to do here in the middle of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.460 
it's going to do here in the middle of
the<00:02:28.780> winter<00:02:30.210> inside<00:02:31.210> under<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> light<00:02:32.050> but

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the winter inside under a light but

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.990 
the winter inside under a light but
we'll<00:02:32.860> give<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.040> shot<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.610> we'll<00:02:33.790> see<00:02:33.880> what

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
we'll give a shot and we'll see what

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.720 
we'll give a shot and we'll see what
happens

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.089 

okay<00:02:39.659> so<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.319> it<00:02:40.560> drilled<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
okay so you can see that it drilled a

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.430 
okay so you can see that it drilled a
series<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> holes<00:02:41.879> along<00:02:42.269> here<00:02:42.569> they're<00:02:43.290> not

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
series of holes along here they're not

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070 
series of holes along here they're not
all<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> same<00:02:43.980> size<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:44.940> not<00:02:45.120> even<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
all the same size they're not even the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.770 
all the same size they're not even the
space<00:02:46.409> necessarily<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.730> got<00:02:48.569> them<00:02:48.659> in

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
space necessarily but I got them in

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.470 
space necessarily but I got them in
there<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.110> wood<00:02:49.409> is<00:02:49.680> pine<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.790> nothing

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
there this wood is pine it's nothing

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.170 
there this wood is pine it's nothing
fancy<00:02:51.980> not<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.099> fancy<00:02:53.310> hope<00:02:53.940> you're<00:02:54.090> watching

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
fancy not in fancy hope you're watching

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.520 
fancy not in fancy hope you're watching
her<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.330> porous<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.959> will<00:02:58.110> soak

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
her now I so what is porous it will soak

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
her now I so what is porous it will soak
in<00:02:58.680> some<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> water<00:02:59.220> i'm<00:02:59.430> sure<00:02:59.610> but<00:02:59.940> i

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
in some of the water i'm sure but i

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.390 
in some of the water i'm sure but i
wanted<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.080> do<00:03:01.530> these<00:03:01.650> drainage<00:03:01.950> holes<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
wanted to do these drainage holes and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.270 
wanted to do these drainage holes and
then<00:03:02.519> as<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:03.620> well<00:03:04.620> maybe<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.129> can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
then as you can see well maybe you can

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.119 
then as you can see well maybe you can
see<00:03:05.489> anyway<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.360> slight<00:03:06.750> bow<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.890> way

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
see anyway there's a slight bow this way

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.979 
see anyway there's a slight bow this way
so<00:03:08.730> i'm<00:03:08.819> going<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:08.970> definitely<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.690> soil

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
so i'm going to definitely have the soil

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.440 
so i'm going to definitely have the soil
be<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.769> side<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.970> hopefully<00:03:12.090> any

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
be on this side so that hopefully any

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
be on this side so that hopefully any
water<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.319> know<00:03:13.910> drain<00:03:14.910> sort<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.420> down

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
water you know drain sort of down

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:37.350 
water you know drain sort of down
towards<00:03:16.079> easy

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.270 

okay<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:38.420> with<00:03:38.629> my<00:03:38.750> mind<00:03:39.049> box<00:03:39.290> constructed<00:03:39.890> I'm

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
okay so with my mind box constructed I'm

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.220 
okay so with my mind box constructed I'm
ready<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.700> go<00:03:40.909> ahead<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.420> make<00:03:41.780> my<00:03:41.930> soil

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
ready to go ahead and make my soil

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.960 
ready to go ahead and make my soil
mixture<00:03:42.590> which<00:03:42.830> is<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:42.980> three-part<00:03:43.549> mixture

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
mixture which is a three-part mixture

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.600 
mixture which is a three-part mixture
again<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.930> got<00:03:45.170> peat<00:03:45.409> moss<00:03:45.590> vermiculite<00:03:46.459> and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
again it's got peat moss vermiculite and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.330 
again it's got peat moss vermiculite and
steer<00:03:47.090> manure<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.769> Square<00:03:49.310> Foot

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
steer manure and the Square Foot

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.250 
steer manure and the Square Foot
Gardening<00:03:49.519> method<00:03:49.849> calls<00:03:50.329> for<00:03:50.569> equal<00:03:50.900> parts

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
Gardening method calls for equal parts

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.960 
Gardening method calls for equal parts
of<00:03:51.409> each<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.430> I'm<00:03:52.519> going<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:52.849> pretty

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
of each so I'm going to do it pretty

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.729 
of each so I'm going to do it pretty

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.830 

okay<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.250> once<00:04:19.579> my<00:04:19.729> mixture<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.269> all<00:04:20.419> shaken

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
okay so once my mixture is all shaken

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.260 
okay so once my mixture is all shaken
together<00:04:21.070> wanna<00:04:22.070> pour<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.460> nicely<00:04:22.699> in<00:04:22.940> my<00:04:23.000> pine

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
together wanna pour it nicely in my pine

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.670 
together wanna pour it nicely in my pine
box<00:04:23.570> here<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.960> I'll<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.199> kind<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
box here and I'll just kind of have to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.830 
box here and I'll just kind of have to
repeat<00:04:28.040> this<00:04:28.250> until<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.240> can<00:04:29.389> fill<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.750> up

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
repeat this until I can fill it up

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.310 
repeat this until I can fill it up
sufficiently<00:04:30.800> which<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:32.389> don't<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.229> I

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
sufficiently which I don't think I

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.960 
sufficiently which I don't think I
already<00:04:33.470> said<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:34.040> it's<00:04:34.250> I'm<00:04:34.520> going<00:04:34.790> for

already said on here it's I'm going for

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.890 
already said on here it's I'm going for
six<00:04:35.210> inches<00:04:35.620> they<00:04:37.360> figured<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.540> in<00:04:38.630> Square

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
six inches they figured that in Square

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.650 
six inches they figured that in Square
Foot<00:04:39.050> Gardening<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.560> could<00:04:39.710> grow<00:04:40.600> all<00:04:41.600> kinds

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
Foot Gardening you could grow all kinds

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.719 
Foot Gardening you could grow all kinds
of<00:04:42.020> vegetables<00:04:42.169> except<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.010> root<00:04:43.160> vegetables

of vegetables except for root vegetables

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.790 
of vegetables except for root vegetables
with<00:04:44.419> six<00:04:44.660> inches<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:45.260> that's<00:04:45.440> kind<00:04:45.590> of<00:04:45.620> what<00:04:45.770> I

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
with six inches so that's kind of what I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.920 
with six inches so that's kind of what I
want<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.070> test<00:04:46.250> here<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:47.150> as<00:04:47.479> you<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:47.720> see<00:04:47.750> I'm

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
want to test here and as you can see I'm

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.779 
want to test here and as you can see I'm
gonna<00:04:48.080> have<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.350> do<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.889> few<00:04:49.250> different

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
gonna have to do it a few different

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.659 
gonna have to do it a few different
times<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:51.620> get<00:04:51.740> six<00:04:52.010> inches<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.520> this

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
times to get to get six inches of this

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.260 
times to get to get six inches of this
mixture<00:04:52.970> here<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.539> bottom<00:04:54.639> already<00:04:55.639> so<00:04:56.060> we

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
mixture here on the bottom already so we

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.830 
mixture here on the bottom already so we
got<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.570> box<00:04:56.750> inside<00:04:57.520> we<00:04:58.520> got<00:04:58.699> my<00:04:59.000> on<00:04:59.510> my

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
got the box inside we got my on my

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.600 
got the box inside we got my on my
mixture<00:05:00.139> in<00:05:00.320> there<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.770> three-part<00:05:01.280> mixture

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
mixture in there the three-part mixture

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.800 
mixture in there the three-part mixture
of<00:05:01.729> our<00:05:01.880> media<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:03.100> manure<00:05:04.100> compost<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
of our media like manure compost and the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.950 
of our media like manure compost and the
peat<00:05:06.199> moss<00:05:06.789> and<00:05:07.789> then<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.389> actually<00:05:08.539> have<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
peat moss and then I actually have it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.840 
peat moss and then I actually have it
sitting<00:05:09.260> right<00:05:09.560> now<00:05:09.710> just<00:05:09.979> kind<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.250> on<00:05:10.400> top<00:05:10.639> of

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
sitting right now just kind of on top of

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.420 
sitting right now just kind of on top of
it<00:05:11.110> there's<00:05:12.110> like<00:05:12.260> four<00:05:12.560> bricks<00:05:12.889> underneath

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
it there's like four bricks underneath

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.129 
it there's like four bricks underneath
each<00:05:13.700> corner<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.450> then<00:05:14.840> there's<00:05:14.960> like<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
each corner and then there's like a

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.170 
each corner and then there's like a
plastic<00:05:15.650> sheet<00:05:15.680> I'll<00:05:16.580> probably<00:05:16.880> need<00:05:17.060> to

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
plastic sheet I'll probably need to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.520 
plastic sheet I'll probably need to
replace<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.720> because<00:05:17.960> this<00:05:18.080> really<00:05:18.410> isn't

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
replace is because this really isn't

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.290 
replace is because this really isn't
going<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.800> do<00:05:18.979> a<00:05:19.220> very<00:05:19.520> good<00:05:19.580> job<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.910> catching

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
going to do a very good job of catching

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.779 
going to do a very good job of catching
any<00:05:20.840> water<00:05:21.200> that<00:05:21.289> drips<00:05:21.560> through<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.190> it

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
any water that drips through but it

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.070 
any water that drips through but it
always<00:05:22.910> kind<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.360> keep<00:05:23.539> it<00:05:23.660> off<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.780> ground

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
always kind of keep it off the ground

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.469 
always kind of keep it off the ground
hopefully<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:25.220> I'll<00:05:25.820> have<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.120> get<00:05:26.240> something

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
hopefully and I'll have to get something

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.839 
hopefully and I'll have to get something
I<00:05:26.930> don't<00:05:27.740> know<00:05:27.800> like<00:05:27.830> an<00:05:28.070> oil<00:05:28.280> pan<00:05:28.490> or

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
I don't know like an oil pan or

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.190 
I don't know like an oil pan or
something<00:05:29.150> some<00:05:29.330> something<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.900> will<00:05:30.020> catch

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
something some something that will catch

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.510 
something some something that will catch
the<00:05:30.380> water<00:05:30.530> a<00:05:30.650> little<00:05:30.830> bit<00:05:31.039> better<00:05:31.160> here<00:05:31.400> in

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
the water a little bit better here in

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.640 
the water a little bit better here in
the<00:05:31.580> future<00:05:31.910> because<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:32.840> will<00:05:33.110> be<00:05:33.289> probably

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
the future because that will be probably

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.940 
the future because that will be probably
a<00:05:33.710> factor<00:05:34.460> with<00:05:35.270> this<00:05:35.479> but<00:05:35.780> I'm<00:05:36.530> ready<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.830> do

that far from the tops of the leaves or
from<00:07:17.990> the<00:07:18.080> soil<00:07:18.260> itself<00:07:18.740> in<00:07:19.340> this<00:07:19.490> case<00:07:19.700> we're

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
from the soil itself in this case we're

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.220 
from the soil itself in this case we're
about<00:07:20.030> six<00:07:20.300> inches<00:07:20.480> away<00:07:20.720> because<00:07:21.020> there's

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
about six inches away because there's

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.040 
about six inches away because there's

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
only six inches of soil in here but as

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.990 
only six inches of soil in here but as
the<00:07:24.260> plants<00:07:24.590> grow<00:07:24.650> we<00:07:24.950> can<00:07:25.100> raise<00:07:25.280> this<00:07:25.580> up<00:07:25.760> on
