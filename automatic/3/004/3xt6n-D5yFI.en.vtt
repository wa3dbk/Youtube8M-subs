00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I think the most important thing so 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.080
 except what I think is the Mayan day 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.550
 when you retire, do not regret 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.599
 say could have come here could 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.580
 to have arrived there and I did not give the maximum 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.580
 because then there is no turning back 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.060
 the sensations are very good and good 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.360
 at the moment then taking minutes and 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.390
 taking advantage to reach a good to a 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.660
 good point of physically and that the mind 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 Well, now it's good again, I think 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.840
 that pretty well 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.510
 so we started in Pamplona that arrived 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 with just two days he told us 34 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.040
 very clear things and the team responded 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.450
 very good and good always a change 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.280
 of coach in half season is 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.410
 complicated to change the dynamics of the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.239
 councils and how to play and 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.340
 good every time because we're 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.820
 getting closer to what he wants and the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.769
 style also a bit of the team and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.019
 well here are going to do the thing 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.510
 adri removing the 05 I think that 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.699
 we compete pretty well so it 's 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.070
 true that we missed a bit because then 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.900
 in the bernabéu materialize the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.730
 occasions that we had and take us a 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.530
 good result for the cup then good 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.350
 it could not be and well what against the barça 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.780
 because we were also there could win 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.640
 any of the shared computers 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.540
 that was very even and against the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.119
 paris then also the same with 05 the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.060
 worst moment of these matches that no 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.290
 we find our form the same and they 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.690
 they were very comfortable in the field 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.869
 and they did not put it very complicated goal of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.509
 Rami gives us a lot of life and good not 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.520
 one more door opens for us there and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.009
 tracing is clear that it is complicated 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.880
 But in football, I never know there's 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.960
 to lower the arms 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.610
 and good we hope that we have done 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.429
 a good match although there is still 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 a lot and it's good for us to win in league 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.240
 to go with more confidence 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.509
 I believe that trying to create more occasions 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.640
 of goal to paris saint germain that 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.399
 We want little and good from there 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 so try in the first part I 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.209
 I think it will be very good I won 0-1 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 to put a little bit in the body and 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.300
 still with 45 minutes 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.129
 I think you could do something, but not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 yes, it's true that I think that 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:22.120
 the low ibrahimovic will also be 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.739
 important you usually see what makes you 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.930
 also grow an injury that makes you 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.700
 mature but good at the end a player 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.709
 prefers to mature and grow otherwise 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.840
 that is not entering an injury but 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.360
 good at the end since the first 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.550
 moment you have to try to be 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.470
 optimistic to try to work for 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.200
 be as good as possible return as soon 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.599
 possible and in the best conditions and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.190
 that's how it has been in the worst days and what is 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.200
 day or night the injury that is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.930
 when you see that there are still a lot 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.880
 I think also time other than that no 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.540
 to leave an injury yes it is true that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.060
 it's mostly how long everything is 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.310
 but but good at the end the knee that 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.829
 it's something that is recovered I think in 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.349
 much worse things like for example the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.239
 abidal cancer theme that is so 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.190
 It is someone who does overcome himself 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.610
 himself and he has made a great effort 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.019
 romeo at the end equal you operas you 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.960
 you recover and again to play and if 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.580
 you go back to each sport as there has been 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.340
 players who have all had even 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.970
 three and they keep playing until neither 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.610
 I think you have to give so much value to the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.640
 always said injury that puts your skin 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 of chicken is something very nice 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.510
 for the player who after so much 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.090
 time you're going to play and that people 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.520
 that is waiting for you and picks you up 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.990
 so much love and nothing what I always say 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.980
 What is it 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.570
 thank you in all the ways that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.610
 I can but I think the best 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.280
 trying to do the best possible to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 the valence and that the more from above 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 is the team because everyone is so 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.500
 happy always good i played so much in 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.240
 the center of the field as open in 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.970
 right or left and they are three 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.550
 positions that I really like not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.320
 I have no priority right now 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.700
 besides what I always say no 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.500
 right now I have so much to play and 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.010
 even as a goalkeeper, take that where 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.500
 put on I will try to give the image I like 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.990
 I like it a lot I usually record the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.910
 matches so more attractive for 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.920
 say some way and well so 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.049
 when he is injured and the next day 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.220
 there had to be something coming from 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.740
 once in a while I did get up for 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.530
 see especially the ricky man hairs 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.430
 blond i like a lot 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.229
 gasol 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.120
 Calderón I do not know is that those who are 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.639
 true final are very good players 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.400
 very very important for your teams and 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.110
 the truth that with anybody would give me 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.740
 all of all the truth is that I like 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.900
 goes by times a little bit almost yes it is 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.889
 truth that what I like the most is the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.750
 american time and good a little is I started 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.970
 very tiny mind and in the end then 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.699
 it's 89 years there that they've given me 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.560
 served to grow to be surrounded 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.500
 I think of very good teams that I 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.380
 have helped a lot to train me as 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.120
 player and that I will always be 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.130
 grateful if the club not so well then I've 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.410
 treated a little with him not much the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.880
 true but but hey was a very uncle 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.860
 loved by everyone there was nobody 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.560
 that spoke badly to you and the truth is that 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.139
 I think it was a stick us for the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.080
 football but for everyone good in 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.240
 principle then when you sign there the 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.210
 first option that was the one that I had 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.039
 in mind that it was clear was 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.720
 to be another year at least given in 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.039
 the racing or so to continue 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.860
 training and keep having minutes 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.030
 but it turned out that I made a 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.919
 preseason very good the mister him 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.110
 like it and I was not yes it is true that 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.380
 It's very complicated to be there so young 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.520
 with so many great players and yes 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.860
 It is true that he has served me 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.930
 a lot to grow mentally but but 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.479
 they are also years 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.419
 I have not thought about moving from 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.130
 here not just anything else, that's when I've 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.620
 come I think I was reaching the 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.870
 better level here because they have gone from the 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.000
 lessons just twice and good 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.100
 I still believe that I have a lot to grow 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.070
 here is a city that is a luxury to be 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.949
 here to live here but the weather is a 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.340
 madness in February half being like this 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:17.550
 it is also a luxury for you 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.789
 accompanies not apart to club then nothing 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.740
 right now because in the short term it recovers 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.139
 one hundred percent to play all the 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.139
 matches that I can and that the mister believes 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.240
 timely and then for long-term 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.560
 try to win titles here 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.780
 probably when I debuted they are not 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.600
 all your life wanting to do that and of 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.300
 suddenly that you get to play in 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.560
 First division is not something very big 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.560
 for anyone who likes football
