a rhino the resin isn't it's not to

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.649 
a rhino the resin isn't it's not to
better<00:01:48.039> quality<00:01:48.700> we'll<00:01:48.939> see<00:01:49.209> when<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> actually

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
better quality we'll see when I actually

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.840 
better quality we'll see when I actually
come<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:51.899> install<00:01:52.899> one

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
come to install one

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.469 
come to install one
also<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.840> brought<00:01:57.200> some<00:01:57.789> rhino<00:01:58.789> doors<00:01:59.149> once

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479

also and I brought some rhino doors once
again<00:01:59.840> which<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.170> thought<00:02:00.319> these<00:02:00.499> would<00:02:00.679> be

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
again which I thought these would be

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.660 
again which I thought these would be
absolutely<00:02:01.130> ideal<00:02:01.609> for<00:02:02.149> deaf<00:02:02.299> company<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.670> like

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
absolutely ideal for deaf company I like

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.589 
absolutely ideal for deaf company I like
the<00:02:04.880> practical<00:02:05.649> arrow<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:07.069> them<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:07.399> well<00:02:07.609> is<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
the practical arrow on them as well is a

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.210 
the practical arrow on them as well is a
little<00:02:09.110> bit<00:02:09.259> rougher<00:02:09.739> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> need<00:02:10.190> some

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
little bit rougher going to need some

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.080 
little bit rougher going to need some
cleaning<00:02:10.879> up<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.269> they<00:02:12.230> should<00:02:12.530> fit<00:02:12.950> quite<00:02:13.730> so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
cleaning up but they should fit quite so

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.619 
cleaning up but they should fit quite so
quite<00:02:14.450> ok<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.980> schools<00:02:16.370> are<00:02:16.610> greater<00:02:17.150> than<00:02:17.390> if

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
quite ok the schools are greater than if

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.130 
quite ok the schools are greater than if
you<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.980> let<00:02:18.980> me<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.190> too<00:02:19.430> close<00:02:21.340> look<00:02:22.340> ok<00:02:23.140> not

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you can let me get too close look ok not

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.229 
you can let me get too close look ok not
bad<00:02:26.709> also<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.950> brought<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.459> alternative<00:02:29.060> to
