00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hi all the boys are all from 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.730
 ulisse are not here with a new one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.350
 video about gta 5 gt online where 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 I will talk about an idea taken from the web 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.370
 created by a user or better a graphic 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.799
 really very very good he has 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 proposed to the rock star an idea 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.960
 concerning gta 5 which speaks of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.960
 possible supercar vehicles in version 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.850
 convertible that absence roof 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 so obviously with the possibility of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.710
 remove the roof from the vehicle like 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.300
 the English say the versions 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 in short, you can remove them 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.309
 the roof of the vehicle when you want 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 and it's a very absurd thing now 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 I'll show you before you begin memories 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.110
 leave you like because there are ed 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 they also go out to sign up for the channel 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 other contents and I would say that we can 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 start right away 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.780
 then why will I show you something 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 some images of the vehicles with the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 convertible versions or at least like 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 say the English convertible and how 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 see this is a company as the says 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.109
 graphic version spyder without canopy 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.090
 and it really is very very row there are 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.120
 two hypotheses could be a vehicle 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 cleansed or a modified vehicle with 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.979
 photoshop this guy is a designer a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.260
 apparently very good as well 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 previously repeated so much 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.979
 probably we talk about the second one 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 hypothesis therefore could have created it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.549
 with photoshop 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 here is another picture of Lazio 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.930
 around you without a lot more tuccio 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 truly spectacular detailed I hope 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 that the rock star promotes this idea has 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 noticed this project obviously one 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
 rockstar giving an answer to the idea of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 this guy and I hope this can 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.369
 go out for any console because 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 I think it is possible to do this too 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.509
 on the old gen consoles 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 not only on next gen and on dated pc there 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.670
 they are also already convertible vehicles 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.649
 let be his dg also on next gen 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.530
 and it does not exist only for the hear 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.810
 as you see in the video the super vehicles 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 convertible version also exists 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 for the hearing and tourism and there are many 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.079
 other vehicle versions 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.079
 there will be many more convertibles 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.909
 because why practically this 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.409
 designer is very active so while 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.939
 you are listening to my voice in the videos 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.030
 probably this guy is creating 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.160
 already other convertible vehicles like 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 repeated even before I hope obviously 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.450
 that all this can be achieved 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 really a crazy absurd because also 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.440
 the rock star as well as the different vehicles 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.379
 convertibles stopped her at 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.019
 habash to create convertible vehicles 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.629
 then he didn't create more than new ones for 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.849
 gta 5 especially ergo we hope hopefully 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.190
 well in short, no kids this 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.500
 was the news I will leave the twitter of the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 really very good design that he created 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.690
 the convertible version for vehicles 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.360
 super and I hope you can also create 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.790
 convertible version for many others 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.250
 vehicles as well as maybe creating new ones 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.590
 ideas like these for 7 5 thanks too 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.360
 to its magnificent graphics then vi 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.060

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.239
 work he is also creating 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.519
 probably right now 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.290
