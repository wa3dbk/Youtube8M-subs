this isn't really even necessary because

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.960 
this isn't really even necessary because
as<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:53.079> showed<00:00:53.380> you<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:54.190> nut<00:00:54.400> wasn't<00:00:54.790> touching

the transmission case my concern with
this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.620> for<00:00:59.920> some<00:01:00.129> tech<00:01:00.400> later<00:01:00.700> on

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750

kind of unaware and they just reef on
this<00:01:18.160> they're<00:01:19.160> likely<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.580> strip<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
this they're likely to strip the

this they're likely to strip the
transmission<00:01:21.200> case<00:01:22.630> or<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:24.620> they're<00:01:24.800> lucky

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
transmission case or if they're lucky

transmission case or if they're lucky
just<00:01:25.340> strip<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.880> pen<00:01:26.150> now<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:26.780> need<00:01:27.050> more<00:01:27.170> heat

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
just strip the pen now we need more heat

just strip the pen now we need more heat
as<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.790> see<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.210> takes<00:01:29.450> some<00:01:29.630> heat<00:01:29.810> map<00:01:30.230> map

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710
