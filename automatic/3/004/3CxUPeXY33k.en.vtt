00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:05.540
 no niche in the not yet a new one 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.110
 car fits the audi a7 hatches completely 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.370
 exactly in the gap between a6 and a8 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.610
 particularly charming the triad 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.139
 driving dynamics form and functionality 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.449
 This coupe is not only for audi 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.909
 Lover stuttgart watch out for the 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.759
 quiet times for the cls are over 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.339
 with 497 longer and almost two meters 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.399
 width defines the one meter 42 flat 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.460
 flounder luxury also over the size and 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.090
 the type designation betrays the a8's 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.920
 not far 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.899
 if you get in, you can get close 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.379
 feel in the diesel version means 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.600
 the three liter tdi with 245 ps 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.730
 but just consumed six liters 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.280
 the most economical six-cylinder diesel 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.839
 world of the new audi a7 does not exist 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160
 then with economical diesel still with 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.170
 powerful petrol engines 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.820
 it's not exactly in the three-liter v6 though 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.469
 you really gas then gives then takes 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.210
 It's a short instant but short 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.789
 on it the compressor not only fire 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.589
 440 newtonmeter direction crankshaft 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.749
 but also 300 ps direction 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.880
 four-wheel drive but that shows it off 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.960
 relatively unimpressed he finally has 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.030
 He still has a very sensitive steering 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.470
 and really stable brakes in the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 behind and who should for the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.130
 not only always safe seven 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 but also very fast what can be 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 really fun 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 But audi is not just about that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.190
 driving dynamics but also to one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.480
 essential part around enjoyment fittings 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.800
 landscape flatters eye and 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.400
 fingertips with stylish 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.840
 Material selection and clean and fish 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.520
 instead of the chunky monitor on the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 you would have become a fitter 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 however, a more elegant solution 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 Especially since the perfect look 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.650
 everywhere else was so important 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.790
 frameless side windows accentuate the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.830
 modern character 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.330
 but with all the splendor comes also the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.840
 not practical sense among the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.900
 bikes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 his competitors mercedes cls jaguar 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 xf &amp; co has the a7 standard 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 four-wheel drive a large electric 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.030
 wide opening tailgate and maximum 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 1390 liters of luggage compartment volume ahead in 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.810
 So this limousine is not only 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.610
 a lot of copy but also a bit of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.470
 view 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.869
 you would have been with so much beauty 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.920
 not the price but then expected 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.920
 around 52,000 euros will be spent on asylum
