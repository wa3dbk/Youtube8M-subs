00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 we have very good roads to go on them 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.230
 nor with the incomparable pleasure and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 autumn and spring is the best time to travel 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.300
 by car out of town I don't know how it all 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 the rest are the heroes of our report 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:25.640
 sure about this teach for their cars 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:31.609
 the road does need lucky and usually 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.609
 ends just begins 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.070
 keeping up with this all-terrain vehicles is easy where 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.690
 they are faster than the maximum rider 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.690
 speed of 20 kilometers per hour 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.730
 you need to accelerate was Dasha turn 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.730
 on the water four times slower 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.540
 not speed matter in terrain 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.000
 development of Cherepovets craftsmen 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.430
 tracked boat and snowmobile in one 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 let not quickly but pass in the forest between 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.470
 trees in mud and snow 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 cabbage here with a car 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.900
 huge jeep tone engine can 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 carry up to 6 people 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.210
 the rest of the sealed case is not 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 carrier wherever it provides 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.180
 body rigidity and does not allow water 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 get solo 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.940
 the main rival to the student will do without 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.940
 track wheel you 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.690
 photographs the signal will show different 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.510
 gestures are naturally positive 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.970
 and going to such a driver will be difficult 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.430
 but it does it with ease 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 curb no obstacles here only on 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 city â€‹â€‹roads in which car cramped 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 the soul is so torn off-road 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.110
 to my us 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.010
 presence of misery 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.829
 on this ethics are big descents and ascents 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.950
 does not go around he is able to climb the mountain 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:24.670
 at an angle of 25 degrees and move down 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:31.900
 if the angle is not more than 30 degrees years time 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.939
 so we she was a cat ask such 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.420
 the place goes almost impossible 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.459
 secret to ultra low pressure tires 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.099
 such a tire does not deform the surface 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.090
 she adapts to it even if 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.889
 under the wheels man pressure in the wheels 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.590
 all-terrain vehicle change depending on 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.079
 terrain the more difficult the roads you 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.030
 I want to be a wheel if you lower 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.639
 pressure of 8 hundredths of the atmosphere 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:04.510
 This 2 touched call will be able to pass on 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:05.670
 man will check and we can angry bird 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 transfer to 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.459
 Mom made javascript I have everything 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.459
 OK 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.650
 it's very scary heart just 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.090
 jumps out of the chest but basically 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.580
 generally involuntarily 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.110
 almost flew out of the list of subjects it 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.110
 Russian flying all-terrain vehicle 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.340
 this is something between the form of the course and the plane 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.120
 because there is an engine here 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.980
 aviation engine in such an all-terrain vehicle 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.230
 the air and the skirts are super durable fabric not 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.110
 give him leave due to this car 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.620
 rises above the surface by 30 50 cm 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.300
 but in order to fly up I really want to fly 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.300
 first had to show 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.110
 hard this work drag people move 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.310
 swamp 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.380
 first trouble during 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.570
 transportation flew the very 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.239
 elements and special courts of solid duck 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.140
 we can 27 this even snatch 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:24.610
 and calmly fly to the service change 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.890
 their one time while young rover 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.650
 amphibians at the site appeared not last 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.990
 battle SUV driver skeptical 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.070
 looked at our side and confidently 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.070
 cut through the mud 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.240
 in good weather such a ride for him 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.279
 yeah well the next car did not want to go 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.889
 it would seem a minute of glory 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:51.289
 flying boat to this point he 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.289
 wound up and confidently went to the volume 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.790
 there is a territory people can't pass 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.160
 tracked off-road vehicles and you and the wheel 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.030
 for example a river with rapids where stones 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.340
 perform 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.930
 go there at least will go very slowly 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.150
 and the airbag will fly with 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.060
 speed of one hundred kilometers an hour but flight 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.930
 was short during the dispersal of water 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.930
 he stalled 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.310
 together with large and powerful floating 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.920
 and flying cars off-road and our 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.780
 the country is already conquering but such a mini 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.780
 all-terrain vehicle check what is its strength 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.020
 bang 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.810
 while you now I just love this for 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.120
 Canadian development is made with 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.999
 China has recently hit Russia 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.639
 all-terrain vehicle tried to maximize 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:50.039
 adapt to our climate here 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.919
 a special drive drum is installed 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:58.689
 snow removal systems and how sticky 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.550
 dirt this baby weighs 120 pounds of it 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.139
 can be folded going looks like 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.840
 thread in the trunk of a car 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.439
 only to control tactics you need 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.930
 get used to 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.840
 lovato principle freedom skateboards then 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.629
 there is a turn to the left you have to bow 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.379
 center of gravity to the left tight pawla center 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:16.379
 gravity right 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.839
 clock error 2 well, it will be easier 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.420
 I 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.630
 I need a tow truck 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.850
 our roads to dirt and on every kind of code 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.270
 there is a 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.270
 impassable tube
