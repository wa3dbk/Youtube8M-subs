00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
close to starving I think I'm going to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
close to starving I think I'm going to
start<00:00:37.170> off<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:38.280> episodes<00:00:38.850> at

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
start off with about three episodes at

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
start off with about three episodes at
first<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> test<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> new<00:00:40.320> editing

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first just to test out the new editing

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729 
first just to test out the new editing
method<00:00:41.070> I've<00:00:41.190> chosen<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.469> these<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.620> gonna

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
method I've chosen and these are gonna

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
method I've chosen and these are gonna
be<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.340> short<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.879> opposed<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
be really short as opposed to what you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
be really short as opposed to what you
guys<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.719> used<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> they're<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.860> be

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
guys are used to it they're not gonna be

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
guys are used to it they're not gonna be
twenty<00:00:47.340> minutes<00:00:47.579> long<00:00:47.760> they're<00:00:48.000> gonna<00:00:48.149> be

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
twenty minutes long they're gonna be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.150 
twenty minutes long they're gonna be
under<00:00:48.660> ten<00:00:48.930> minutes<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.590> make<00:00:49.739> sure<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
under ten minutes I will make sure of it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
under ten minutes I will make sure of it
because<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.660> editing<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.410> three

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because I do not like editing for three

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
because I do not like editing for three
hours<00:00:52.770> straight<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> twenty

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
hours straight just to get a twenty

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.500 
hours straight just to get a twenty
minute<00:00:54.329> video<00:00:54.420> rather<00:00:55.410> I'd<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.850> rather<00:00:56.879> edit

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
minute video rather I'd much rather edit

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
minute video rather I'd much rather edit
for<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:58.050> hour<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> ten<00:00:59.010> minute

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
for about an hour and get a ten minute

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
for about an hour and get a ten minute
video<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.239> saves<00:01:00.449> me<00:01:00.629> more

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
video because that just saves me more

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
video because that just saves me more
time<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> means<00:01:01.500> more<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
time and that means more time I can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
time and that means more time I can
actually<00:01:02.550> spend<00:01:02.760> drawing<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> doing

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
actually spend drawing or doing

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.189 
actually spend drawing or doing
something<00:01:03.719> else

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
something else

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.230 
something else
so<00:01:04.589> unrelated<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.670> projects<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so unrelated to all those projects I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.289 
so unrelated to all those projects I
just<00:01:06.450> mentioned<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> code<00:01:07.500> orange<00:01:07.740> -<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> don't

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
just mentioned is code orange - I don't

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.550 
just mentioned is code orange - I don't
know<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.570> many<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> guys<00:01:10.049> watched<00:01:10.350> the

know how many of you guys watched the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
know how many of you guys watched the
first<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.159> called<00:01:11.490> Code<00:01:11.790> Orange<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.450> made

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
first one called Code Orange that I made

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
first one called Code Orange that I made
with<00:01:12.960> my<00:01:13.110> cousins<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> friends<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
with my cousins and friends but that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
with my cousins and friends but that
movie<00:01:15.990> wasn't<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.650> great<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.340> we're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
movie wasn't all that great but we're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
movie wasn't all that great but we're
making<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.880> second<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.540> sort<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> goes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
making the second one which sort of goes

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.789 
making the second one which sort of goes
off<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
off of that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
off of that
but<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.580> gonna<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.820> rather<00:01:21.450> different<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
but it's gonna be rather different it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.330 
but it's gonna be rather different it's
gonna<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.409> much<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.590> we're<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.100> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gonna be much better we're gonna have

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
gonna be much better we're gonna have
better<00:01:23.909> quality<00:01:24.390> we've<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.930> planning

this<00:01:25.500> time<00:01:25.970> hopefully<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.090> turns<00:01:27.420> out

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
this time hopefully it just turns out

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.020 
this time hopefully it just turns out
better<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.290> it'll<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.770> cool

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
better and I think it'll be really cool

better and I think it'll be really cool
