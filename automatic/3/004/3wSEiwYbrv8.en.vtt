00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
from that of the 70s which is very

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
is an example of these changes I

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.810 
is an example of these changes I
wouldn't<00:01:09.320> say<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:09.800> far<00:01:10.040> back<00:01:10.369> as<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
wouldn't say it's as far back as the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.750 
wouldn't say it's as far back as the
video<00:01:11.119> game<00:01:11.420> Triassic<00:01:12.170> period<00:01:12.200> with<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.830> 2600
