of color change so I'm going to show you
the<00:01:22.380> wrong<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:22.979> first<00:01:23.399> so<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.299> why

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the wrong way first so you can see why

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.779 
the wrong way first so you can see why
we<00:01:24.840> shouldn't<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.469> it<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> way<00:01:26.069> and<00:01:26.640> it's

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
we shouldn't do it this way and it's

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.029 
we shouldn't do it this way and it's
actually<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.990> correct<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.499> to<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.799> every

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
actually the correct way to do every

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.489 
actually the correct way to do every
other<00:01:29.069> color<00:01:29.640> change<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.749> would<00:01:31.170> work<00:01:31.350> up

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
other color change so you would work up

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.289 
other color change so you would work up
to<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.740> last<00:01:31.950> stitch<00:01:32.189> which<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.969> in<00:01:33.179> our

main<00:01:33.539> color<00:01:33.810> RMC<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.939> want<00:01:36.149> our

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
main color RMC and then we want our

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.789 
main color RMC and then we want our
first<00:01:36.600> stitch<00:01:36.899> which<00:01:37.139> is<00:01:37.319> this<00:01:37.469> is<00:01:37.619> where

first stitch which is this is where
we're<00:01:37.950> joining<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.429> first<00:01:38.729> stitch<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.969> our

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
we're joining the first stitch of our

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.989 
we're joining the first stitch of our
next<00:01:39.420> round<00:01:39.569> in<00:01:39.899> our<00:01:40.020> contrasting<00:01:40.770> color<00:01:40.999> so

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
next round in our contrasting color so

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.789 
next round in our contrasting color so
if<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.420> were<00:01:42.539> doing<00:01:42.749> a<00:01:42.810> regular<00:01:42.990> color<00:01:43.409> change

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
if we were doing a regular color change

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.919 
if we were doing a regular color change
we<00:01:44.369> would<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.609> course<00:01:44.639> go<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> very

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
we would of course go up to the very

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.109 
we would of course go up to the very
last<00:01:46.109> step<00:01:46.499> for<00:01:46.770> step<00:01:47.249> for<00:01:47.520> our<00:01:47.609> last<00:01:47.850> stitch

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
last step for step for our last stitch

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.629 
last step for step for our last stitch
and<00:01:48.950> join<00:01:49.950> our<00:01:50.399> new<00:01:50.880> color<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:52.280> then<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.490> would

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
and join our new color and then we would

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.760 
and join our new color and then we would
join<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.119> round<00:01:54.359> by<00:01:54.600> inserting<00:01:55.109> our<00:01:55.530> hook

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
join our round by inserting our hook

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.270 
join our round by inserting our hook
into<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.100> first<00:01:56.490> stitch<00:01:57.770> slip<00:01:58.770> stitching

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
into that first stitch slip stitching

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.629 
into that first stitch slip stitching
and<00:01:59.819> then<00:01:59.999> chaining<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.039> doing<00:02:02.369> our

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
and then chaining one and then doing our

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.370 
and then chaining one and then doing our
first<00:02:02.939> single<00:02:03.270> crochet<00:02:03.389> in<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.139> new<00:02:04.259> color

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
first single crochet in the new color

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
first single crochet in the new color
now<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> reason<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.459> want<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.450> our

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
now the reason we don't want to do our

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.440 
now the reason we don't want to do our
color<00:02:10.110> change<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:11.880> we're

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
color change this way is because we're

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.990 
color change this way is because we're
going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.990> little<00:02:13.050> spike<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:14.100> color

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
going to get this little spike of color

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.760 
going to get this little spike of color
in<00:02:15.560> our<00:02:16.560> previous<00:02:17.099> round<00:02:18.170> now<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:19.709> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
in our previous round now it's not a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.830 
in our previous round now it's not a
horrible<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
horrible thing to have but it just

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.350 
horrible thing to have but it just
doesn't<00:02:22.080> keep<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.620> picture<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.250> crisp<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
doesn't keep your picture as crisp and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.650 
doesn't keep your picture as crisp and
clean<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.490> your<00:02:26.490> seam<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.210> invisible<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
clean and your seam as invisible as it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.960 
clean and your seam as invisible as it
would<00:02:28.750> be<00:02:28.960> if<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.920> perform<00:02:30.490> your<00:02:30.670> color

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
would be if you perform your color

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.440 
would be if you perform your color
change<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.530> correct<00:02:33.010> way<00:02:33.280> or<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.060> way<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
change the correct way or the way that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.700 
change the correct way or the way that
is<00:02:34.720> less<00:02:35.620> visible<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.900> way<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.590> are

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
is less visible and the way that you are

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.830 
is less visible and the way that you are
going<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:41.460> finishing<00:02:42.460> off<00:02:42.910> your

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
going to do that is finishing off your

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.460 
going to do that is finishing off your
last<00:02:44.050> stitch<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.670> same<00:02:45.880> color<00:02:46.240> so<00:02:47.020> we're

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470

single crochet in our main color now
we're<00:02:53.110> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> join<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.680> round<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:55.000> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
we're going to join the round this is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.670 
we're going to join the round this is
where<00:02:55.450> we're<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> change<00:02:56.050> our<00:02:56.410> color

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
where we're going to change our color

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.380 
where we're going to change our color
we're<00:02:57.130> going<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.310> insert<00:02:57.610> our<00:02:57.760> hook<00:02:57.970> into<00:02:58.270> that

we're going to insert our hook into that
first<00:02:58.840> stitch<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.590> can<00:02:59.890> join<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.280> round

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460

and then we're going to yarn over with
our<00:03:04.800> contrasting<00:03:05.800> color<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.240> we'll<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.510> drop

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750

tutorial on creating invisible seams
you'll<00:03:19.210> know<00:03:19.390> why<00:03:19.600> I'm<00:03:19.780> tugging<00:03:20.080> down<00:03:20.290> on

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
you'll know why I'm tugging down on

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.000 
you'll know why I'm tugging down on
these<00:03:21.250> as<00:03:21.700> much<00:03:22.330> as<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:22.710> I'm<00:03:23.710> going<00:03:23.770> to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
these as much as I can I'm going to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.280 
these as much as I can I'm going to
chain<00:03:24.340> one<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.180> I'm<00:03:25.300> going<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.450> tug<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:26.050> down

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.890 
chain one and I'm going to tug that down
to<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.880> it'll<00:03:28.060> make<00:03:28.150> sense<00:03:28.420> once<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.840> see

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.290 
to and it'll make sense once you see
that<00:03:29.320> tutorial<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:30.700> I'm<00:03:30.850> going<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> do

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
that tutorial and then I'm going to do

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.699 
that tutorial and then I'm going to do
my<00:03:31.450> first<00:03:31.480> single<00:03:32.050> crochet<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.530> can

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
my first single crochet and as you can

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.449 
my first single crochet and as you can
see<00:03:35.770> now<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:36.910> have<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.420> spike<00:03:37.900> of

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
see now we don't have that spike of

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.250 
see now we don't have that spike of
yellow<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.670> we<00:03:39.790> had<00:03:39.970> earlier<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.750> it's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
yellow that we had earlier and it's

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.250 
yellow that we had earlier and it's
going<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> give<00:03:41.709> us<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.950> much<00:03:42.220> better<00:03:42.550> picture

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
going to give us a much better picture

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.510 
going to give us a much better picture
overall<00:03:44.260> when<00:03:44.620> our<00:03:44.740> picture<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.100> complete

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
overall when our picture is complete

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.550 
overall when our picture is complete
because<00:03:45.700> if<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.060> had<00:03:46.240> that<00:03:46.480> every<00:03:47.080> single<00:03:47.350> row

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
because if we had that every single row

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.860 
because if we had that every single row
you<00:03:48.400> would<00:03:48.520> start<00:03:48.790> seeing<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.209> little<00:03:49.390> kind<00:03:49.750> of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
you would start seeing a little kind of

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.620 
you would start seeing a little kind of
-<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:51.070> your<00:03:51.220> picture<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:51.970> kind<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.270> helps

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
- in your picture so this kind of helps

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.840 
- in your picture so this kind of helps
keep<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:52.959> cleaner<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.950> that's<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.520> clean

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
keep it cleaner and that's the clean

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.570 
keep it cleaner and that's the clean
color<00:03:55.209> change
