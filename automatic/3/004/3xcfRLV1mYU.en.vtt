00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
put the rivet there just in case you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.189 
put the rivet there just in case you
know<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> trail<00:00:53.180> driving

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
know you're out in the trail driving

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.049 
know you're out in the trail driving
off-road<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.770> there's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> lot<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> vibrations

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
off-road and there's a lot of vibrations

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
off-road and there's a lot of vibrations
and<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> could<00:00:57.510> come<00:00:57.690> loose<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> also<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and it could come loose and also like I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
and it could come loose and also like I
said<00:00:59.640> it'll<00:01:00.300> give<00:01:00.600> somebody<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
said it'll give somebody a little bit of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.880 
said it'll give somebody a little bit of
a<00:01:01.969> deterrent<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.140> grab<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> thing

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a deterrent to to just grab the thing

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
a deterrent to to just grab the thing
and<00:01:05.070> pull<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> steal<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> now

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and pull it off and steal it so and now

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
and pull it off and steal it so and now
let's<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> engine<00:01:11.460> bay<00:01:11.670> I'll<00:01:12.330> show

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
let's go into the engine bay I'll show

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.760 
let's go into the engine bay I'll show
you<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> did<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> hooked<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:17.390> okay

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
you what I did how I hooked it up okay

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.590 
you what I did how I hooked it up okay
naturally<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.930> running<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
naturally it's running through that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.120 
naturally it's running through that
Inlet<00:01:24.600> piece<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.250> aam<00:01:26.970> brute<00:01:27.330> force

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
Inlet piece and on my aam brute force

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
Inlet piece and on my aam brute force
cold<00:01:29.130> air<00:01:29.400> intake<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:31.189> piped<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:32.720> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
cold air intake I just piped it into the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.710 
cold air intake I just piped it into the
side<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> box<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.970> there's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
side of the box right there and there's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.310 
side of the box right there and there's
that<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.509> plenty<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> suction

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that and then I got plenty of suction

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.950 
that and then I got plenty of suction
through<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.939> river<00:01:42.899> Raider<00:01:43.259> snorkel<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
through the river Raider snorkel so we

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
through the river Raider snorkel so we
have<00:01:46.079> two<00:01:46.320> points<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> suction<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:49.340> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
have two points of suction and it's that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.569 
have two points of suction and it's that
point<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.060> also<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.930> original<00:01:52.710> point<00:01:53.009> down

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
point and also the original point down

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.530 
point and also the original point down
here<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> got<00:01:56.520> plenty<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.909> airflow<00:01:57.420> going

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
here so so I got plenty of airflow going

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.940 
here so so I got plenty of airflow going
into<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.490> air<00:01:59.610> intake<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.950> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
into the air intake and that's that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.370 
into the air intake and that's that
helps<00:02:02.280> increase<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.759> gas<00:02:03.390> mileage<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.079> little

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
helps increase the gas mileage a little

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
helps increase the gas mileage a little
bit<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.799> much<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:06.299> adds<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bit not much but also adds a lot of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
bit not much but also adds a lot of
extra<00:02:07.469> cold<00:02:08.129> air<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> engine

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
extra cold air to the engine

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
extra cold air to the engine
and<00:02:10.350> gives<00:02:10.650> a<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:10.980> bit<00:02:11.190> more<00:02:11.370> horsepower

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and gives a little bit more horsepower

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.190 
and gives a little bit more horsepower
as<00:02:12.240> well<00:02:12.450> I'm<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.560> too<00:02:13.770> concerned<00:02:14.310> about

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
as well I'm not too concerned about

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
as well I'm not too concerned about
going<00:02:16.200> deep<00:02:16.740> in<00:02:17.090> water<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:19.260> ever<00:02:20.450> plan<00:02:21.450> on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
going deep in water if I ever plan on

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
going deep in water if I ever plan on
doing<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> future<00:02:22.800> all<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.150> to

the snorkel to the air intake right
there<00:02:47.550> that's<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.330> ever<00:02:48.510> planning<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.140> going

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
there that's if I ever planning on going

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.330 
there that's if I ever planning on going
across<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.520> river<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:50.870> anywhere<00:02:51.870> deep<00:02:52.340> but

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
across the river or anywhere deep but

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.160 
across the river or anywhere deep but
I'm<00:02:53.460> not<00:02:53.610> planning<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.120> doing<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.510> too<00:02:54.960> much

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I'm not planning on doing that too much

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.530 
I'm not planning on doing that too much
but<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.130> doubt<00:02:56.640> very<00:02:56.670> much<00:02:57.150> I'll<00:02:57.360> go

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
but if I do I doubt very much I'll go

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
but if I do I doubt very much I'll go
anywhere<00:02:57.990> higher<00:02:58.260> than<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.860> here<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:01.380> that's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
anywhere higher than this here so that's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
anywhere higher than this here so that's
that<00:03:01.950> everything<00:03:02.850> looks<00:03:03.150> good<00:03:04.790> okay<00:03:05.820> in

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that everything looks good okay in

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.400 
that everything looks good okay in

of<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.180> job<00:04:35.820> had<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:37.330> do<00:04:37.510> with<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.080> fact<00:04:38.380> that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
of this job had to do with the fact that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.170 
of this job had to do with the fact that
this<00:04:38.949> hose<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:40.380> way<00:04:41.380> over<00:04:41.800> sized<00:04:42.100> for<00:04:43.060> the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
this hose is way over sized for the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.950 
this hose is way over sized for the
project<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.400> three<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.750> half

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
project this is like a three and a half

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.700 
project this is like a three and a half
to<00:04:47.290> four<00:04:47.530> inch<00:04:47.800> hose<00:04:48.210> three<00:04:49.210> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
to four inch hose three and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.990 
to four inch hose three and
three-quarter<00:04:50.710> inch<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.550> doesn't<00:04:51.910> need

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
three-quarter inch and it doesn't need

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.189 
three-quarter inch and it doesn't need
to<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.540> thick<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:54.010> wish<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.789> was<00:04:54.970> was<00:04:55.960> about

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
to be that thick I wish it was was about

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.290 
to be that thick I wish it was was about
two<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.860> half<00:04:56.889> inches<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:58.030> could<00:04:58.180> have

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
two and a half inches you could have

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.029 
two and a half inches you could have
easily<00:04:58.570> got<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.229> through<00:04:59.500> here<00:04:59.830> without

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
easily got it through here without

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.430 
easily got it through here without
fighting<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:01.030> for<00:05:01.360> an<00:05:01.590> hour<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:04.150> you'll<00:05:05.139> still

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
fighting it for an hour and you'll still

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.029 
fighting it for an hour and you'll still
have<00:05:05.680> plenty<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.220> low<00:05:06.550> flow<00:05:07.510> volume<00:05:08.229> going<00:05:08.770> to

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
have plenty of low flow volume going to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.700 
have plenty of low flow volume going to
the<00:05:09.190> engine<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.120> this<00:05:10.630> hose<00:05:10.840> was<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.530> bit

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
the engine so this hose was a little bit

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.460 
the engine so this hose was a little bit
too<00:05:11.919> thick<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.580> little<00:05:13.240> bit<00:05:13.389> too<00:05:13.570> or<00:05:13.960> why<00:05:14.169> they

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
too thick a little bit too or why they

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.260 
too thick a little bit too or why they
wish<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.740> was<00:05:14.860> about<00:05:15.160> two<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.550> a<00:05:15.639> half<00:05:15.669> inches

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
wish it was about two and a half inches

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.870 
wish it was about two and a half inches
and<00:05:17.110> he<00:05:17.410> said<00:05:17.680> it's<00:05:17.860> three<00:05:18.160> inches<00:05:18.370> but<00:05:18.729> it's

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
and he said it's three inches but it's

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.020 
and he said it's three inches but it's
three<00:05:19.150> inches<00:05:19.479> at<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.810> flange<00:05:20.110> but<00:05:20.919> here<00:05:21.370> it's

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
three inches at the flange but here it's

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.090 
three inches at the flange but here it's
about<00:05:22.330> four<00:05:22.750> inches<00:05:22.780> from<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:23.620> point<00:05:23.919> to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
about four inches from this point to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.800 
about four inches from this point to
this<00:05:24.250> point<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.919> that's<00:05:26.919> what<00:05:27.430> really<00:05:27.810> made

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
this point so that's what really made

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.350 
this point so that's what really made
that<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.229> pain<00:05:29.650> in<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.919> butt<00:05:30.160> trying<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.180> get

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
that a pain in the butt trying to get

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.330 
that a pain in the butt trying to get
these<00:05:31.539> bolts<00:05:31.930> in<00:05:32.200> because<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:32.650> was<00:05:32.800> lifting

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
these bolts in because it was lifting

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.320 
these bolts in because it was lifting
everything<00:05:33.520> up<00:05:35.010> if<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.220> hose<00:05:36.460> was<00:05:36.880> small

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
everything up if the hose was small

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.830 
everything up if the hose was small
enough<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.950> two<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.430> half<00:05:39.700> inch<00:05:40.060> you

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
enough like two and a half inch you

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.960 
enough like two and a half inch you
could<00:05:40.990> have<00:05:41.110> used<00:05:41.320> these<00:05:41.590> plastic<00:05:42.250> Clips<00:05:42.610> and

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
could have used these plastic Clips and

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.930 
could have used these plastic Clips and
they've<00:05:43.120> been<00:05:43.270> done<00:05:43.620> just<00:05:44.620> like<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:45.160> but

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
they've been done just like that but

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.480 
they've been done just like that but
since<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.419> hose<00:05:46.630> was<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.139> thick<00:05:47.500> pushing

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
since the hose was so thick pushing

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.360 
since the hose was so thick pushing
everything<00:05:48.760> up<00:05:49.150> they<00:05:49.660> have<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.349> foot<00:05:50.620> we<00:05:51.340> have

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
everything up they have the foot we have

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.640 
everything up they have the foot we have
to<00:05:51.610> put<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:51.940> stainless<00:05:52.419> steel<00:05:52.479> bolts<00:05:53.110> which<00:05:53.349> I
