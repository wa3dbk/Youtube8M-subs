and<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:43.640> lot<00:00:43.789> of<00:00:44.600> songs<00:00:44.840> he<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:45.379> at<00:00:45.500> co-op

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
and a lot of songs he was at co-op

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.130 
and a lot of songs he was at co-op
regression

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:02.840 

so<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> practice<00:00:52.440> him

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:17.310 

this<00:01:03.850> shit's<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.509> bittersweet

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.980 

to<00:01:18.320> my

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.859 

despite<00:01:25.990> your<00:01:26.079> own<00:01:26.200> pattern<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.829> flour<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
despite your own pattern of flour the

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.310 
despite your own pattern of flour the
only<00:01:29.110> can<00:01:29.259> do<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.759> see

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.289 

you<00:01:35.320> can't<00:01:35.530> play<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:36.009> regular<00:01:36.189> left<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:37.060> play<00:01:37.210> an

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you can't play a regular left to play an

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.620 
you can't play a regular left to play an
easier

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.120 

and<00:01:42.630> gee

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.480 

I<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:50.170> go<00:01:50.350> around<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:57.070> know<00:01:57.190> some

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
I just go around and I don't know some

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:23.010 
I just go around and I don't know some
without<00:01:57.640> cooperation<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:59.070> changing

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.089 

so<00:02:24.020> that's<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.410> little<00:02:24.530> bit<00:02:24.620> fit<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.980> work

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
so that's just a little bit fit to work

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.440 
so that's just a little bit fit to work
on<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.090> get<00:02:26.209> your<00:02:26.330> chord<00:02:26.569> changes<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.050> bit

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on just to get your chord changes a bit

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.900 
on just to get your chord changes a bit
bit<00:02:29.450> faster
