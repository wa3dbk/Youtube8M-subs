00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
have to pay anything extra for it see so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
have to pay anything extra for it see so
they're<00:01:52.619> automatically<00:01:53.130> assuming<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they're automatically assuming that

people are using this this application

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
people are using this this application
my<00:01:56.430> why<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> doesn't

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
my why to do that but that doesn't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
my why to do that but that doesn't
necessarily<00:01:58.649> mean<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.670> they're<00:02:00.420> using<00:02:00.689> this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
necessarily mean that they're using this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.109 
necessarily mean that they're using this
now<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.409> 18<00:02:01.740> C<00:02:01.920> fails<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> realize<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
now what 18 C fails to realize is that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
now what 18 C fails to realize is that
just<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.600> people<00:02:03.630> use<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> lot<00:02:04.439> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
just because people use and a lot of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
just because people use and a lot of
data<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.909> necessarily<00:02:06.420> mean<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
data does not necessarily mean that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.500 
data does not necessarily mean that
there

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
there

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.820 
there
you're<00:02:07.600> using<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.930> jailbreak<00:02:08.290> yeah<00:02:08.440> doesn't

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
you're using a jailbreak yeah doesn't

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.680 
you're using a jailbreak yeah doesn't
mean<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.190> they're<00:02:09.370> jailbroken<00:02:09.850> at<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.150> to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
mean that they're jailbroken at all to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.130 
mean that they're jailbroken at all to
be<00:02:10.810> honest<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.710> use<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> very<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:14.020> know

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
be honest you can use a very you know

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.250 
be honest you can use a very you know
data<00:02:14.640> consuming<00:02:15.640> at<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.030> what<00:02:16.960> about<00:02:17.050> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
data consuming at like what about the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.890 
data consuming at like what about the
sling<00:02:17.530> Slingbox<00:02:18.280> player<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.300> use<00:02:19.480> that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
sling Slingbox player you can use that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.200 
sling Slingbox player you can use that

but really you can't blame this on

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.490 
but really you can't blame this on
unauthorized<00:02:34.240> tethering<00:02:34.750> method<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.230> put<00:02:35.410> it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
unauthorized tethering method now put it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500 
unauthorized tethering method now put it
like<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.130> 18t<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.240> cares

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
like this do you think 18t really cares

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.550 
like this do you think 18t really cares
whether<00:02:38.500> or<00:02:38.710> not<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.160> person<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
whether or not a person with the you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.680 
whether or not a person with the you
know<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.070> two<00:02:42.100> gigabyte<00:02:42.640> data<00:02:42.820> plan<00:02:43.150> is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
know with the two gigabyte data plan is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.470 
know with the two gigabyte data plan is
using<00:02:44.620> tethering<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:45.460> do<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.030> 18d

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
using tethering or not do you think 18d

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.910 
using tethering or not do you think 18d
cares<00:02:46.720> about<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.050> well<00:02:47.200> no<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.680> they're
