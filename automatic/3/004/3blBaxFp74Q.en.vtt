00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.930
 new video 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 In this video I show you some 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.099
 major security holes in the new 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.259
 ios 8 which he also published on the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 both new iphones are up and running 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 this can easily fix 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.949
 all these gaps allow you or 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 other things like contacts facebook 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 or to access messages 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 possible makes the way, when he siri 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'll show you that I already 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 I've updated eight on iOS 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 we get the settings and then find 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 under general info the version number 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 8.0 also I have already here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.190
 my iphone 5 a code lock 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 activated 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.010
 We can see that here because we have one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 code will be asked 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.680
 let's start with that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.750
 first gap that allows us 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 on the call list on some contacts 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 and on the call functions 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 access 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:12.630
 to say how siri just show one 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:14.729
 call list and here we see one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 call list from the contacts on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.049
 last called this iphone 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.909
 and if we click on it then 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.750
 is also possible to call us 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.549
 to start this person 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.320
 the teased back lets on unread 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.360
 to access news and even on 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.479
 to answer these 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.229
 I'll give it a try 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.229
 New Messages 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:02:05.399
 yes message arrived 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:07.409
 exclamation point and it's that simple 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.619
 So over series unauthorized messages too 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.619
 send out 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.549
 but there is another 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:21.470
 Bank with which you take notes and 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:21.470
 even change can show my notes 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.500
 and here we will see a list 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.650
 all the notes on this iphone 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.560
 ipod or ipad exist 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:47.849
 we can even edit these add 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:50.599
 add something to a note that 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.599
 right point 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.220
 and here we see the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.770
 updated note and the whole 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.720
 content the biggest mistake is mine 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.520
 opinion, however, that about 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.650
 deposited on the device 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.650
 Post a facebook account without permission 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:32.030
 poster on facebook hello com 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:34.580
 this is a test yes and has been 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.620
 our status is updated without us 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.640
 had to enter some code or us 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.870
 otherwise identified 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.790
 but how can you be sure that 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.489
 nobody is missing out on your device 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.580
 simply uses disabled siri 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.590
 in the lockscreen this simply switches to 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.560
 the settings scroll here 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.959
 down a little bit and then finds 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.600
 her here under coach where he once again 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.850
 your code must enter the 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.190
 possibility in the spear state some 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.750
 to deactivate things 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.500
 to fix this problem was enough 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.500
 to disable siri 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.890
 I recommend you, however, the 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.100
 other things to disable 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.289
 such as the message view resp 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.720
 facebook and reply with message 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.940
 so you have more privacy 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.660
 and if we go up again now 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.919
 go to our lockscreen and try 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.440
 to activate them 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.039
 nothing happens the same 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.660
 Notification Center has been disabled so 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.919
 So it's just his iphone before 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.830
 to protect foreign access 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.200
 so now you know everything so without 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.700
 a password is possible if 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.169
 you would find the video helpful I would 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.760
 I look forward to a thumbs up 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.400
 and if you have any questions write 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.810
 Just in the comments 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.669
 if you are cool for some now 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.620
