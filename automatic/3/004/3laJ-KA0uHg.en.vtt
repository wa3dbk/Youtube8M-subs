00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the game also implements impulse boost

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
the game also implements impulse boost
and<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.220> makes<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> game<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.570> blast

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and this makes the game just a blast

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
and this makes the game just a blast
it's<00:01:52.290> significantly<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:52.979> challenging<00:01:53.700> than

the<00:02:28.260> MiG<00:02:28.470> deciding<00:02:29.010> thing<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> game

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the MiG deciding thing is that the game

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.910 
the MiG deciding thing is that the game
maintains<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.300> constant<00:02:30.540> 60<00:02:31.020> frames<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.530> second

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
maintains a constant 60 frames a second

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
maintains a constant 60 frames a second
which<00:02:32.280> gives<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> game<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.910> serious<00:02:33.510> sense<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
which gives the game a serious sense of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
which gives the game a serious sense of
speed<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.260> other<00:02:34.380> iphone<00:02:34.739> racers<00:02:35.100> have<00:02:35.310> not

a button mode and a slider touch mode
which<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:42.989> very<00:02:43.170> similar<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.800> they<00:02:44.250> offer

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
which are very similar and they offer

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.040 
which are very similar and they offer
excellent<00:02:45.180> response<00:02:45.540> times<00:02:45.810> they're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
excellent response times they're

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.570 
excellent response times they're
actually<00:02:46.440> my<00:02:46.620> preferred<00:02:46.769> method<00:02:47.459> of

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
actually my preferred method of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.890 
actually my preferred method of
navigating<00:02:48.180> throughout<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> game<00:02:48.660> but

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
navigating throughout the game but

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.960 
navigating throughout the game but
there's<00:02:49.440> also<00:02:49.680> an<00:02:50.040> accelerometer<00:02:50.489> based

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
there's also an accelerometer based

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.820 
there's also an accelerometer based
control<00:02:51.360> system<00:02:51.720> which<00:02:52.110> actually<00:02:52.350> does<00:02:52.800> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
control system which actually does a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.830 
control system which actually does a
really<00:02:53.280> good<00:02:53.580> job<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.750> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
really good job if that's what you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.259 
really good job if that's what you
prefer<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:56.100> AI<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.430> play<00:02:56.760> against<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
prefer the AI you play against is

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.540 
prefer the AI you play against is

pretty much everyone out of the water on

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
games like these but after four to five

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
games like these but after four to five
hours<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.420> playing<00:03:03.780> I've<00:03:04.019> only<00:03:04.290> got<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.769> first

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
hours of playing I've only got in first

to<00:03:12.810> eighth<00:03:13.140> place<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.950> be<00:03:14.040> frustrating

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
to eighth place which can be frustrating

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.309 
to eighth place which can be frustrating
