00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.320 

in<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.949> we<00:00:02.129> are<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.669> find<00:00:02.970> some

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
in this video we are going to find some

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.760 
in this video we are going to find some
of<00:00:03.510> n<00:00:03.750> natural<00:00:04.200> numbers<00:00:05.009> we<00:00:05.850> know<00:00:06.029> that

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
of n natural numbers we know that

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:16.279 
of n natural numbers we know that
natural<00:00:07.770> numbers<00:00:14.150> are<00:00:15.150> numbers<00:00:15.570> starting

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
natural numbers are numbers starting

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
natural numbers are numbers starting
from<00:00:16.320> 1<00:00:17.449> 2<00:00:18.560> 3<00:00:20.119> 4<00:00:21.119> 5<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.359> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.570> up

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
from 1 2 3 4 5 and like that this is up

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.870 
from 1 2 3 4 5 and like that this is up
to<00:00:25.019> n<00:00:25.289> since<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> last

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to n since we do not know the last

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.470 
to n since we do not know the last
number<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.960> write<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.439> n<00:00:28.789> which<00:00:29.789> means<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
number we write it as n which means that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.340 
number we write it as n which means that
any<00:00:30.810> number<00:00:31.140> prior<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.099> n<00:00:32.399> would<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.540> n

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
any number prior to this n would be n

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.370 
any number prior to this n would be n
minus<00:00:34.610> 1

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
minus 1

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.090 
minus 1
prior<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.800> would<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.280> n<00:00:38.550> minus<00:00:38.629> 2<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
prior to this would be n minus 2 and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
prior to this would be n minus 2 and
like<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.300> 3<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.980> n<00:00:44.280> 1<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
like that it will be 3 to n 1 so you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
like that it will be 3 to n 1 so you
know<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> series<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.250> n<00:00:47.520> natural

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
know the series of this n natural

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.080 
know the series of this n natural
numbers<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.320> also<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.710> written<00:00:49.920> backwards<00:00:50.430> as

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
numbers can also be written backwards as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
numbers can also be written backwards as
n<00:00:51.660> M<00:00:52.230> s<00:00:52.469> 1<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> s<00:00:53.160> 2<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.680> now<00:00:55.680> since<00:00:55.949> we

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
n M s 1 and s 2 like that now since we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090 
n M s 1 and s 2 like that now since we
want<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.730> find<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> M<00:00:58.559> natural

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
want to find out some of M natural

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
want to find out some of M natural
numbers<00:00:59.550> let<00:01:00.390> s<00:01:00.899> n<00:01:01.609> denote<00:01:02.609> some<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.719> n<00:01:03.899> natural

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
numbers let s n denote some of n natural

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.000 
numbers let s n denote some of n natural
numbers<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.339> equal<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> 1<00:01:06.650> plus<00:01:07.650> 2

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
numbers so this is equal to 1 plus 2

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:19.999 
numbers so this is equal to 1 plus 2
Plus<00:01:08.850> 3<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.210> n<00:01:12.390> minus<00:01:13.100> 2<00:01:19.009> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
Plus 3 and like that up to n minus 2 so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
Plus 3 and like that up to n minus 2 so
if<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.150> write<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> reverse

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
if we if we write in the reverse

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.420 
if we if we write in the reverse
direction<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.950> SN<00:01:24.409> can<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.950> written<00:01:26.250> as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
direction this SN can also be written as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:44.240 
direction this SN can also be written as
n<00:01:27.259> plus<00:01:33.740> 1<00:01:36.770> minus<00:01:37.770> 2<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.899> 3<00:01:42.899> plus<00:01:43.890> 2

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
n plus 1 minus 2 and like that 3 plus 2

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.109 
n plus 1 minus 2 and like that 3 plus 2
that's<00:01:44.820> 1<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.829> add<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.460> add<00:01:47.670> these

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's 1 now if we add it up add these

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.740 
that's 1 now if we add it up add these
two<00:01:48.950> series<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.890> 2<00:01:53.220> SN<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:56.159> equal<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
two series we get 2 SN is equal to so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.370 
two series we get 2 SN is equal to so
here<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.939> as

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
here what we do as

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.830 
here what we do as
we<00:02:02.040> add<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:04.250> with<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.430> end<00:02:05.700> too<00:02:06.479> with

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
we add this one with this end too with

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.729 
we add this one with this end too with
this<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:08.119> minus-13<00:02:09.119> within<00:02:09.539> me<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.590> we

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this and minus-13 within me so what we

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.640 
this and minus-13 within me so what we
get<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.310> n<00:02:11.819> plus<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:14.430> equal<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.910> in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
get here is n plus one is equal to in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.590 
get here is n plus one is equal to in
this<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.140> here<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.410> becomes<00:02:20.600> two

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
this one here and here it becomes two

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.979 
this one here and here it becomes two
plus<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.650> total<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
plus and this one so if we total this

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.550 
plus and this one so if we total this
this<00:02:27.989> comes<00:02:28.319> out<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> be<00:02:28.739> n<00:02:29.040> plus<00:02:29.550> 1<00:02:30.560> similarly

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
this comes out to be n plus 1 similarly

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
this comes out to be n plus 1 similarly
when<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.520> are<00:02:32.550> adding<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.150> 3<00:02:33.480> plus<00:02:34.440> n<00:02:34.890> minus<00:02:35.430> 2

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
when we are adding this 3 plus n minus 2

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.720 
when we are adding this 3 plus n minus 2
this<00:02:37.290> adds<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.130> n<00:02:38.580> plus<00:02:39.150> 1<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.489> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this adds up to n plus 1 so like that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.440 
this adds up to n plus 1 so like that
when<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.269> keep<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.690> adding<00:02:43.040> we<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.310> these<00:02:45.000> 2's

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
when we keep on adding we get these 2's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.780 
when we keep on adding we get these 2's
and<00:02:46.410> yes<00:02:47.130> 1<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.350> combine<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.220> we

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and yes 1 so if we combine or this we

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:00.940 
and yes 1 so if we combine or this we
get<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.950> s<00:02:53.310> n<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:55.140> equal<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.709> n<00:02:55.950> times<00:02:57.200> n<00:02:58.200> plus<00:02:58.950> 1

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
get to s n is equal to n times n plus 1

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.930 
get to s n is equal to n times n plus 1
this<00:03:01.950> n<00:03:02.190> plus<00:03:02.250> 1<00:03:02.850> how<00:03:03.540> many<00:03:03.720> times<00:03:04.019> n<00:03:04.260> times<00:03:04.940> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
this n plus 1 how many times n times so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.930 
this n plus 1 how many times n times so
SN<00:03:07.310> or<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.000> sum<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.269> n<00:03:09.630> natural<00:03:10.019> numbers<00:03:10.940> will

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
SN or the sum of n natural numbers will

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.900 
SN or the sum of n natural numbers will
be<00:03:12.150> n<00:03:12.860> into<00:03:13.860> n<00:03:14.100> plus<00:03:14.489> 1<00:03:15.060> upon<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> let's<00:03:20.400> let's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
be n into n plus 1 upon so let's let's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.810 
be n into n plus 1 upon so let's let's
let's<00:03:21.269> verify<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.299> example<00:03:24.870> our<00:03:25.049> n

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
let's verify this so for example our n

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.759 
let's verify this so for example our n
let's<00:03:26.820> say<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.209> there<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.709> know<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.190> s<00:03:29.540> n

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
let's say is there and we know that s n

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.690 
let's say is there and we know that s n
up<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:32.190> 10<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:33.510> equal<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.820> 55<00:03:35.820> ok<00:03:36.450> how<00:03:36.810> 1<00:03:37.799> plus<00:03:38.310> 2

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
up to 10 is equal to 55 ok how 1 plus 2

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.920 
up to 10 is equal to 55 ok how 1 plus 2
Plus<00:03:39.269> 3<00:03:39.799> plus<00:03:40.799> 4<00:03:42.560> 5<00:03:43.820> 6<00:03:44.930> 7<00:03:46.430> plus<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.850> plus<00:03:48.510> 9

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
Plus 3 plus 4 5 6 7 plus a plus 9

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.599 
Plus 3 plus 4 5 6 7 plus a plus 9
understand<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.820> have<00:03:51.090> 1<00:03:51.660> plus<00:03:52.079> 2<00:03:52.190> 3<00:03:55.370> 3<00:03:56.370> plus

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
understand so we have 1 plus 2 3 3 plus

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:08.000 
understand so we have 1 plus 2 3 3 plus
3<00:03:56.820> 6<00:03:57.590> 6<00:03:58.590> plus<00:03:58.950> 4<00:03:59.190> 10<00:04:00.380> 15<00:04:01.380> 20<00:04:02.690> 138<00:04:04.519> 36<00:04:05.600> 45<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.049> 55

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
3 6 6 plus 4 10 15 20 138 36 45 and 55

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.490 
3 6 6 plus 4 10 15 20 138 36 45 and 55
so<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.489> have<00:04:08.579> 55<00:04:09.090> let's<00:04:09.660> put<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.199> formula

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
so we have 55 let's put in the formula

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.340 
so we have 55 let's put in the formula
so<00:04:11.310> since<00:04:11.579> n<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.820> equal<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.359> 10<00:04:12.630> we

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
so since n is equal to 10 we

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.400 
so since n is equal to 10 we
to<00:04:13.590> put<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.160> formula<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.320> we<00:04:16.320> have<00:04:18.410> since

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
to put in this formula and we have since

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.340 
to put in this formula and we have since
n<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.920> equal<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> 10<00:04:20.730> we<00:04:21.570> are<00:04:21.660> going<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.989> put<00:04:22.200> in

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
n is equal to 10 we are going to put in

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.610 
n is equal to 10 we are going to put in
the<00:04:22.470> formula<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.820> 10<00:04:24.350> into<00:04:25.580> 10<00:04:26.580> plus<00:04:26.880> 1

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the formula so we have 10 into 10 plus 1

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.400 
the formula so we have 10 into 10 plus 1
upon<00:04:28.620> 2<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.590> 5<00:04:32.010> this<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:33.390> 5<00:04:34.050> times<00:04:36.410> 11

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
upon 2 so this is 5 this is 5 times 11

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:49.160 
upon 2 so this is 5 this is 5 times 11
is<00:04:37.620> 55<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:42.290> sum<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:44.240> n<00:04:45.240> natural<00:04:46.050> numbers<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:48.170> n

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
is 55 so sum of n natural numbers is n

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.790 
is 55 so sum of n natural numbers is n
into<00:04:49.530> n<00:04:49.800> plus<00:04:49.830> 1<00:04:50.100> pi
