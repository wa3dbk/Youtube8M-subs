00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:10.349
 and today I come to teach you how to enable 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:17.330
 and disable usb ports also serves 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:21.140
 for dvd and usb drives 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 a removable disk and we verify that if 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.910
 works 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.950
 is the content of our life 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.990
 now let's start run 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.790
 entering this code and which one I'm going 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.540
 to give in the description of the video and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540
 let's accept 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.289
 we go to each team configuration and 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:48.440
 administrative and then a folder 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.960
 systems 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.840
 now let's go to the second access folder 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.290
 removable storage 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 finally all kinds of 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.130
 removable storage and we give 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.060
 enabled 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.060
 we accept 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.760
 and ready 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.490
 we are going to 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.850
 our team and we verify that the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.460
 unit is no longer recognized by our 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 computer and we have it enter and we 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.900
 will show an error 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 now if we want to see it enable 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.710
 see you 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.140
 not configured we can also leave it 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.620
 link disabled although that is another 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.180
 form but which is where in my 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.630
 team 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 we accept and close well here already 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.850
 our unit appears again 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 we enter 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.830
 our good content friends is 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 perfect for today I hope you give me a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.860
 like 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 to be able to climb more and be able to help them 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.909
 in other inconveniences that we have 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.940
 I want to tell you that this way we 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.959
 serves for our privacy so that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.660
 do not enter more links to our pc 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.260
 so that we do not get a crime and also 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.270
 as a way of having our things 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.520
 saved since then we can have 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.100
 Confidential or very personal information 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.470
 then it is a good way to protect 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.250
 our files of people that we 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:39.310
 want to remove this ready I hope you 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.310
 I like den and I hope you are very well
