00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.040
 the patrús mayor program starts now 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.750
 in the last four years 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.509
 the care of the health of the beautiful 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.549
 Horizon was in the background 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.099
 today who needs the public service 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.890
 paid a high price for the lack of 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.050
 Prefecture investment for a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 mayor who has sensitivity and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.929
 investing in health is a priority but today 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 unfortunately it 's not what happens in bh 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.280
 the city hall gives signs that it worries 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.150
 much with the numbers already the life of the 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.640
 people 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.190
 and then the reality of the streets ends up being 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 quite different from that presented by the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 current mayor on television, we are in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.800
 front of the upa new sale 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.420
 here on the second and third floors 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.740
 should have been working for more than 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 three years 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 the leonor maternity leonor brook only 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 which is not in the first half of 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.370
 2009 the authorities visited the work 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 expected to be delivered in July 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.969
 that year, maternity could 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.469
 perform 350 births per month 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.670
 from there to almost 9 thousand births 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.829
 they are no longer made here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.409
 the complaint I most hear from 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.270
 The people that I take care of are lack of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.520
 medicines basic medicines 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 medicine at high pressure 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 treat diabetes medicines for pain 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.990
 basic things for asthma is this hand 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 I like people in one of them 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 Anxieties also because 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 medicines we interrupt the chain 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.799
 of care 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.520
 there are no doctors missing 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.190
 nursing nurses to delay and some 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.680
 we in some exams 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.800
 it is necessary to commit 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.780
 our clinical evaluation our treatment 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.900
 not compromising the lives of some 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.760
 users are 18 thousand people for two 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.010
 family health doctors is our 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.720
 health center he got thanks to the 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.250
 community mobilization 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.310
 the approval of the participatory budget 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.990
 in 2009 it has been four years and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.670
 today the work has not started that people 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.680
 need to work for health 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.620
 currently people are just turning off 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.590
 fire one of the things that for me 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.640
 the current management was to listen to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 and include them in the formulation of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.120
 policies in the discussion of problems 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.940
 of health 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.980
 did not miss listening missed included 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.440

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.590
 I want to discuss health almost 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.480
 every day in this campaign here in bh 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.890
 specialized and missing beds 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.220
 the waiting time for a query with 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.400
 specialist for the exam is too long 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.040
 of 2009 here has reduced the number of 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.350
 family health teams and tens of thousands of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.470
 they are missing doctors is 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.900
 Missing management, my commitment, let's go. 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.390
 change this picture is more action four 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 the creation of samu throughout brazil 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.480

 investments for the purchase of 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.629
 most unlikely drugs are 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.879
 four bh made the first capital 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.160
 Brazil to municipalize health with 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.970
