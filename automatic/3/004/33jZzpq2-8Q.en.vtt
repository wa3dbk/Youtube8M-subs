are<00:03:33.500> our<00:03:34.280> view<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.810> immoral

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
are our view is that this is immoral

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.520 
are our view is that this is immoral
this<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:36.950> wrong<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.079> therefore<00:03:39.260> it

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
this is wrong and so therefore it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.900 
this is wrong and so therefore it
shouldn't<00:03:39.709> be<00:03:40.750> celebrated<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:43.040> let's

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
shouldn't be celebrated and so I let's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.340 
shouldn't be celebrated and so I let's
take<00:03:44.090> other<00:03:44.269> some<00:03:44.540> other<00:03:44.690> cake<00:03:45.079> baking

many people so deeply ah well that's

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.680 
many people so deeply ah well that's
certainly<00:05:19.190> not<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.430> intent<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.150> hurt<00:05:20.270> people

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
certainly not the intent to hurt people

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.670 
certainly not the intent to hurt people
but<00:05:21.260> i<00:05:21.290> want<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.590> say<00:05:21.770> look<00:05:22.070> if<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.430> celebrate

but i want to say look if you celebrate

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.380 
but i want to say look if you celebrate
something<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:25.520> god<00:05:25.790> has<00:05:26.090> clearly

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
something that god has clearly

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.710 
something that god has clearly
communicated<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.410> sin<00:05:28.120> then<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.540> are

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
communicated is sin then you are

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.570 
communicated is sin then you are
actually<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.320> one<00:05:30.500> who<00:05:30.530> is<00:05:30.830> hurting<00:05:31.220> people

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
actually the one who is hurting people

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.340 
actually the one who is hurting people
by<00:05:32.090> encouraging<00:05:32.690> their<00:05:33.500> sinful<00:05:34.130> behavior<00:05:34.910> and

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
by encouraging their sinful behavior and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.840 
by encouraging their sinful behavior and
so<00:05:36.350> that's<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.680> key<00:05:36.830> question<00:05:36.860> here<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.490> this

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
so that's the key question here is this

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.840 
so that's the key question here is this
is<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.240> sinful<00:05:38.750> behavior<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.500> in<00:05:40.220> that<00:05:40.280> case<00:05:40.580> if

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
is a sinful behavior and in that case if

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.180 
is a sinful behavior and in that case if
it<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.150> then<00:05:41.450> Jesus's<00:05:42.110> teaching<00:05:42.800> doesn't

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
it is then Jesus's teaching doesn't

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.140 
it is then Jesus's teaching doesn't
apply<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:44.410> and<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:45.590> can<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:47.000> can

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
apply and and you can you can

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.960 
apply and and you can you can
demonstrate<00:05:47.450> that<00:05:47.930> no<00:05:48.500> we<00:05:48.920> are<00:05:49.160> as<00:05:49.460> Christians

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
demonstrate that no we are as Christians

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.200 
demonstrate that no we are as Christians
