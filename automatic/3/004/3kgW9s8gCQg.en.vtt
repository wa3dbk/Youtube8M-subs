00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.350
 all the elimination matches are 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:07.109
 complicated as they have all been 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 those in this first round and good 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.580
 knowing that we face a very rival 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.650
 difficult a rival who is doing the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 things very well and that also comes 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.790
 rested not training at home 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.440
 after more than a week and without 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.580
 have been able to play the previous date 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.200
 we are waiting 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.090
 to talk to the teacher to see what is it 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.390
 what are you thinking that you have in mind 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.640
 for the game 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.790
 surely 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 we are playing as a visitor we have the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.650
 idea that we should have continuity 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 but we know the rival that we are 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.920
 facing how strong is local and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.579
 the good eliminator that we are 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.199
 doing 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.359
 that the measures will have to be taken 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.579
 corresponding Chilean selection as 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.550
 happens with all the elections now and 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.820
 There is little to know in the sense 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.710
 that we all know we know the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.379
 players how do we do the process that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.940
 they are doing in doing many things 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.910
 very good in the tie 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.410
 and we know the potential they have in their 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.600
 players the potential they have 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.550
 playing in local condition and also 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.560
 from all of this 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.390
 they gave the opportunity to rest 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.890
 the first date is to say that we respect 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.810
 but we come with the idea of ​​doing 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 our job of trying to follow 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.250
 adding up in the tie and making a 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.930
 good commitment to another of the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.270
 comparisons are always odious when 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.369
 the people who were here 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.619
 he does not work anymore with the team, I think 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.880
 we have to think about what 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.570
 we are doing at work that 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
 we are doing in continuing to look 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.409
 the things that this technical body wants 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.079
 on the head of professor pekerman of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.179
 us and try to translate that into the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.189
 we are now important are very 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.319
 good players we will try to be 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.469
 very attentive and hopefully we can 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.950
 to control pitifully we could not 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.869
 accompany 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
 always but they are not partners and they 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.189
 feel the absence as the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.619
 absence of any of those who 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.049
 we are here because we are all a team 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.090
 a family and good could not be recovered 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.470
 for the game but hopefully not 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 we can have for the next
