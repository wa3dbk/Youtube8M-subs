00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello good guys on youtube or he's top 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.210
 recorded on the second video passes on the video 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.049
 how to reuse some parts in the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.970
 horse and stock with two dvds 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 I'm going to teach you a simple 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.930
 list because I do not see previous stayed 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.689
 many doubts 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 Now I will pass that were to be the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 people is the following situation 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.110
 I have the first dvd here I'll try 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 enjoy some parts of it he did not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.059
 is working the most because you have the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.520
 board of a burned card and so 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.710
 it is not working 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 cd player dvd is only working 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 pendrive so I'll try to fix it and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 reusing parts instead 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.070
 First I'll call you here to see. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 and I'll call gay 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.809
 as you can see, there is not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.809
 managing to run the cd gives to try 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.479
 some some parts like partner law 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 can be so many other things to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 but then what am I going to do? 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.170
 I'm going to start the driver who is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.860
 burned on the board and I'll try to play 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.700
 he 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700
 get to work 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:39.900
 very careful when disassembling not to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.580
 harm any parts that turn 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.580
 popular by law behind 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.940
 Are you holding it for me? 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.580
 I was alone here for now. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.490
 now I'm going to start the other approach a 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.490
 little 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.870
 and on the other hand to start the works with 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 very careful 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:37.939
 now let's put it in the past if it goes 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:37.939
 give the right position in the attack 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.720
 which is one of the steps that gives more 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.349
 work that is to position how much this 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.349
 it's a little more difficulty 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.950
 But it will work out right here in the cafe. 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 Let's put the screws 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.319
 ah 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:30.650
 screws here turn the other way 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.650
 Now let's greet the wires. 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.200
 was in a 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.430
 what the other all ok turned by another 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.940
 be careful not to touch the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.190
 milk can damage now let's find 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.580
 soon to grant la plata four rain 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.580
 again 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:21.480
 Now let's get this law going to try. 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:29.250
 reading has started to roll 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:31.260
 Let's see here you can read the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.130
 next camera ready began to make the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.980
 reading 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.520
 that's all worked out 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.280
 I just took a few pieces of loot 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.260
 who was with the plate burned and already 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.440
 I took it and put it in this other taiwan 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.300
 Tip if you liked my page 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.900
 and other letters 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.200
 the next one the camera are two marks 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.919
 of restaurants and it's the British only gave 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.620
 right 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.200
 changed because the environment is very 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.440
 important is you look at the voltage if 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.950
 the same voltage will not work 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.000
 There you are if you liked my video. 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.000
 there until the next
