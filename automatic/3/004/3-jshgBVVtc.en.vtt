a lot of time on a portion of the effect

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.209 
a lot of time on a portion of the effect
that<00:00:47.520> will<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.750> function<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.800> I've<00:00:50.100> been

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that will not function the way I've been

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.500 
that will not function the way I've been
trying<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> function<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
trying to make it function it just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
trying to make it function it just
doesn't<00:00:51.840> work<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.160> had<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
doesn't work that way and I had to do it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
doesn't work that way and I had to do it
like<00:00:53.789> three<00:00:54.120> different<00:00:54.329> ways<00:00:54.660> wasting

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like three different ways wasting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.319 
like three different ways wasting
probably<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.219> hour<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.850> time<00:00:56.879> all

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
probably about an hour of my time all

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
probably about an hour of my time all
told<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> doesn't<00:00:59.010> sound

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
told but I don't know that doesn't sound

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
told but I don't know that doesn't sound
like<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> lot<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.910> feel<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.149> every<00:01:00.510> hour

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
like a lot but I feel like every hour

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
like a lot but I feel like every hour
counts<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.320> stage<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> whole

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
counts at this stage like that's a whole

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
counts at this stage like that's a whole
hour<00:01:02.430> wasted<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.300> hour<00:01:03.449> further

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
hour wasted I could be an hour further

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.890 
hour wasted I could be an hour further
on<00:01:04.260> another<00:01:04.680> effect<00:01:05.129> shot<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.600> more

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
on another effect shot if I was more

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
on another effect shot if I was more
practiced<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:08.100> visual<00:01:08.520> effects<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.510> not

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
practiced at visual effects but I'm not

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
practiced at visual effects but I'm not

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.050 
movie to like surprise us again that
kind<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.140> ground<00:03:58.470> swell<00:03:58.829> happens<00:03:59.519> once<00:03:59.760> for<00:04:00.030> a

kind of ground swell happens once for a
franchise<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.780> think<00:04:01.049> other<00:04:01.500> than<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.829> star

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
franchise I think other than the star

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.190 
franchise I think other than the star
wars<00:04:02.160> franchise<00:04:02.310> which<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.750> know<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
wars franchise which just you know the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.770 
wars franchise which just you know the
rules<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.910> expectation<00:04:05.910> reality<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:06.540> apply

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
rules of expectation reality don't apply

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.960 
rules of expectation reality don't apply
to<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> star<00:04:07.170> wars<00:04:07.290> franchise<00:04:07.380> ever<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.459> age

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
to the star wars franchise ever so age

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.900 
to the star wars franchise ever so age
of<00:04:09.239> Ultron<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.930> think<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.530> almost<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:11.370> more

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
of Ultron I think it's almost a more

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.210 
of Ultron I think it's almost a more
solidly<00:04:12.510> written<00:04:13.579> conceived<00:04:14.579> movie<00:04:15.390> than
