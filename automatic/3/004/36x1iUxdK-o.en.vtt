gonna try to kill some of these guys get
three<00:03:22.420> ended<00:03:23.110> up<00:03:23.200> getting<00:03:23.410> taken<00:03:23.530> out<00:03:23.829> and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
three ended up getting taken out and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.819 
three ended up getting taken out and
spawning<00:03:25.510> back<00:03:25.720> at<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.959> same<00:03:26.110> spot<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:26.500> there

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
spawning back at the same spot now there

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.440 
spawning back at the same spot now there
is<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:26.980> way<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.190> use<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> javelin<00:03:27.820> down<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:28.239> but

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
is a way to use a javelin down there but

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.910 
is a way to use a javelin down there but
you<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.019> have<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.170> lot<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.410> team<00:03:29.560> coverage

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
you have to have a lot of team coverage

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.220 
you have to have a lot of team coverage
and<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.360> little<00:03:31.540> bit<00:03:31.660> more<00:03:31.810> difficult<00:03:32.140> to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
and it is a little bit more difficult to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.920 
and it is a little bit more difficult to
you<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.560> use<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> think<00:03:33.670> maybe<00:03:34.120> I'll<00:03:34.299> do<00:03:34.900> I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
you to use and I think maybe I'll do I

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.229 
you to use and I think maybe I'll do I
actually<00:03:35.140> end<00:03:35.440> up<00:03:35.470> doing<00:03:35.829> it

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
actually end up doing it

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.929 
actually end up doing it
I<00:03:36.269> think<00:03:37.049> no<00:03:37.409> I<00:03:37.439> didn't<00:03:38.010> get<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.159> chance<00:03:38.430> right

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
I think no I didn't get a chance right

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.360 
I think no I didn't get a chance right
here<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.769> shoot<00:03:40.890> all<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.189> way<00:03:41.280> in

times<00:04:33.599> but<00:04:34.199> um<00:04:34.550> but<00:04:35.550> never<00:04:35.759> like<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.000> javelin

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
times but um but never like a javelin

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.180 
times but um but never like a javelin
only<00:04:36.660> without<00:04:36.930> kill<00:04:37.139> streaks<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.590> knew<00:04:38.039> can

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
only without kill streaks I knew can

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.770 
only without kill streaks I knew can
right<00:04:38.340> here<00:04:38.460> I'm<00:04:38.729> thinking<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.539> might<00:04:39.630> be

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
right here I'm thinking it might be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.420 
right here I'm thinking it might be
spawning<00:04:40.110> back<00:04:40.320> down<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> side<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.099> like<00:04:41.280> I'm

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
spawning back down that side so like I'm

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.890 
spawning back down that side so like I'm
gonna<00:04:41.610> lose<00:04:41.760> javelin<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.360> over<00:04:42.539> there<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:42.870> I

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
gonna lose javelin up over there but I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.409 
gonna lose javelin up over there but I
think<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.229> touches<00:04:43.409> down<00:04:43.560> at<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.889> top<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.729> I'm

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
think it touches down at the top and I'm

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.480 
think it touches down at the top and I'm
over<00:04:45.960> here<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.199> know<00:04:46.320> there's<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.650> guy<00:04:46.770> above<00:04:47.159> so

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
over here I know there's a guy above so

over here I know there's a guy above so
I<00:04:47.550> go<00:04:47.849> try<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.090> flush<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.510> guy<00:04:48.720> out

definitely<00:04:59.030> worth<00:04:59.330> using<00:04:59.600> the<00:05:00.230> javelin<00:05:00.620> you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
definitely worth using the javelin you

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.920 
definitely worth using the javelin you
have<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.250> be<00:05:01.340> careful<00:05:01.760> though<00:05:01.910> because<00:05:02.150> if<00:05:02.840> you

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
have to be careful though because if you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.720 
have to be careful though because if you
don't<00:05:03.169> shoot<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.530> correctly<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.490> you'll

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
don't shoot it correctly and that you'll

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.700 
don't shoot it correctly and that you'll
see<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:04.970> do<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.210> couple<00:05:05.570> fails<00:05:05.780> right<00:05:05.990> here<00:05:06.200> if

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
see I do a couple fails right here if

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.110 
see I do a couple fails right here if
you<00:05:06.830> don't<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.100> too<00:05:07.190> correctly<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.610> hits<00:05:07.850> the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
you don't you too correctly it hits the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.150 
you don't you too correctly it hits the
ceiling<00:05:08.419> of<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.900> above<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.320> can<00:05:09.889> kill

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
ceiling of the above you can kill

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.120 
ceiling of the above you can kill
yourself<00:05:10.280> which<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.210> no<00:05:11.480> you<00:05:11.540> know<00:05:12.350> use<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:13.010> you

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
yourself which is no you know use to you

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.030 
yourself which is no you know use to you
or<00:05:13.310> your<00:05:13.460> team<00:05:13.639> but<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.260> blows<00:05:15.530> up<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:15.919> you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
or your team but but it blows up if you

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.070 
or your team but but it blows up if you
don't<00:05:16.220> clear<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:17.210> top<00:05:17.419> area<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:17.990> got

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
don't clear the top area so you just got

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.300 
don't clear the top area so you just got
to<00:05:18.200> kind<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.350> figure<00:05:18.530> out<00:05:18.650> where<00:05:18.889> they<00:05:19.010> go<00:05:19.100> I

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
to kind of figure out where they go I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.620 
to kind of figure out where they go I
can<00:05:19.460> see<00:05:19.580> three<00:05:19.820> guys<00:05:20.000> up<00:05:20.180> there<00:05:20.330> like<00:05:20.450> dude

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
I was like I know that this is gonna

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.350 
I was like I know that this is gonna
touch<00:05:30.380> down<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.770> get<00:05:30.860> some<00:05:31.010> kills<00:05:31.240> ended<00:05:32.240> up

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
trying so I was definitely two fails I

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.590 
trying so I was definitely two fails I
could<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:36.889> probably<00:05:37.100> got<00:05:37.310> 11<00:05:37.729> or<00:05:37.850> I<00:05:38.030> don't

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
could have probably got 11 or I don't

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.110 
could have probably got 11 or I don't
even<00:05:38.750> know<00:05:38.960> more<00:05:39.290> than<00:05:39.410> more<00:05:39.860> than<00:05:39.889> the<00:05:40.610> kills

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
even know more than more than the kills

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.580 
even know more than more than the kills
I<00:05:41.210> needed<00:05:41.419> those<00:05:41.510> guy<00:05:41.690> right<00:05:41.870> there<00:05:41.900> Nova<00:05:42.290> and

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
I needed those guy right there Nova and

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.159 
I needed those guy right there Nova and
watch<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.250> as<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.270> spawn<00:05:44.510> back<00:05:44.660> in<00:05:44.840> my<00:05:44.990> javelin

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
watch this as I spawn back in my javelin

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.450 
watch this as I spawn back in my javelin
touches<00:05:45.530> down<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.800> gives<00:05:45.919> me<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.130> double

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
touches down and gives me the double

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.219 
touches down and gives me the double
that's<00:05:47.000> really<00:05:47.240> what<00:05:47.389> helps<00:05:47.690> me<00:05:47.840> because<00:05:48.139> I

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
that's really what helps me because I

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.480 
that's really what helps me because I
get<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.590> javelin<00:05:48.979> kills<00:05:49.160> and<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.370> counts

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
get the javelin kills and it counts

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.390 
get the javelin kills and it counts
towards<00:05:49.700> my<00:05:49.910> next<00:05:50.150> kill<00:05:50.330> streaks<00:05:50.540> because<00:05:51.139> I

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
towards my next kill streaks because I

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.800 
towards my next kill streaks because I
responded<00:05:52.400> and<00:05:52.520> got<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:52.850> kills<00:05:53.060> since<00:05:53.720> the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
responded and got the kills since the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.690 
responded and got the kills since the
javelin<00:05:54.139> takes<00:05:54.290> so<00:05:54.440> much<00:05:54.530> time<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:54.979> as<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:55.550> get

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
javelin takes so much time so as I get

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.420 
javelin takes so much time so as I get
stunned<00:05:55.970> I<00:05:56.240> shoot<00:05:56.720> this<00:05:56.840> one<00:05:56.990> up<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.380> I<00:05:58.190> get

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
stunned I shoot this one up and I get

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.950 
stunned I shoot this one up and I get
the<00:05:58.520> triple<00:05:58.760> from<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.180> one<00:05:59.360> that<00:05:59.479> I<00:05:59.510> just

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
the triple from that one that I just
