00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
video cuz it will get quite tedious to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.380 
video cuz it will get quite tedious to
just<00:00:29.220> watch<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> pages<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.939> through<00:00:30.179> both

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
just watch the pages go through both

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
just watch the pages go through both
show<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.199> involved<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> book

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
show you what is involved I have a book

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
show you what is involved I have a book
here<00:00:33.030> used<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.649> shelf<00:00:34.920> taking

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
here used to just be on my shelf taking

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.770 
here used to just be on my shelf taking
up<00:00:35.430> space<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.180> did<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.480> literally

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
up space so what I did was literally

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.510 
up space so what I did was literally
just<00:00:36.989> ripped<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> cover<00:00:37.559> off

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
just ripped a cover off

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.540 
just ripped a cover off
it's<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.540> quite<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:40.160> enough<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> rip<00:00:41.430> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's so off quite well enough to rip in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
it's so off quite well enough to rip in
the<00:00:41.640> cover<00:00:41.850> off<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> pages<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.840> stuck

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the cover off all the pages are stuck

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
the cover off all the pages are stuck
together<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.070> need<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.460> scrape<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
together so you will need to scrape the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.330 
together so you will need to scrape the
glue<00:00:45.210> off<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.600> had<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.590> through<00:00:46.860> through<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
glue off I had to go through through it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
glue off I had to go through through it
through<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> pages<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.660> make<00:00:48.870> sure

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
through the pages and you know make sure

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
through the pages and you know make sure
they're<00:00:49.200> unstoppable<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:50.039> sure<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> can

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
they're unstoppable make sure you can

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
they're unstoppable make sure you can
flip<00:00:50.969> through<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:52.010> mean<00:00:53.010> ideally<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
flip through them I mean ideally you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
flip through them I mean ideally you
would<00:00:53.699> separate<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.780> book<00:00:54.989> hat<00:00:55.170> into

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
would separate the book hat into

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
would separate the book hat into
sections<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.360> then<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> would<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> paper

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
sections and then you would use a paper

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
sections and then you would use a paper
trimmer<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.949> trim<00:00:59.340> along<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> edge<00:00:59.879> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
trimmer and just trim along the edge to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.009 
trimmer and just trim along the edge to
get<00:01:00.329> rid<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:01.020> enough<00:01:01.289> nasty<00:01:01.859> bluey<00:01:02.640> edge

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
get rid of just enough nasty bluey edge

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
get rid of just enough nasty bluey edge
so<00:01:04.019> let's<00:01:04.229> grab<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> handful<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> pages<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.090> mean

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so let's grab a handful of pages I mean

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.440 
so let's grab a handful of pages I mean
it<00:01:06.860> believe<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.729> limit<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.600> 50<00:01:11.450> but

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
it believe the the limit is about 50 but

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
it believe the the limit is about 50 but
I<00:01:12.600> mean<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.350> double-sided<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
I mean this is double-sided so this is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.300 
I mean this is double-sided so this is
33<00:01:15.479> pages<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> thick<00:01:16.680> cover<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.100> well

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
33 pages there but a thick cover as well

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
33 pages there but a thick cover as well
so<00:01:18.060> we'll<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.360> how<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> gets<00:01:19.110> on

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so we'll see how this can that gets on

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
so we'll see how this can that gets on
with<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> position<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
with that now the way you position the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.340 
with that now the way you position the
pages<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> first<00:01:24.450> page<00:01:24.750> goes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
pages this is the the first page goes

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
pages this is the the first page goes
goes<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> goes<00:01:27.420> upside<00:01:27.810> down

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
goes on the back and it goes upside down

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.630 
goes on the back and it goes upside down
but<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> scanner<00:01:30.320> figures<00:01:31.320> out

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
but that's how the scanner figures out

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
but that's how the scanner figures out
how<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> scan<00:01:33.689> both<00:01:33.900> sides<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> page

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
how to scan both sides of the page

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.039 
how to scan both sides of the page
correctly<00:01:35.000> no<00:01:36.000> we're<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.270> literally<00:01:36.900> hit

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
correctly no we're just literally hit

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.580 
correctly no we're just literally hit
the<00:01:37.079> bus<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.310> happens

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.690 

another<00:01:42.549> page<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.000> kind<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.299> flying<00:01:43.509> through

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
another page is kind of flying through

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.800 
another page is kind of flying through
it's<00:01:45.700> all<00:01:45.790> being<00:01:45.970> scanned<00:01:46.180> of<00:01:46.270> correctly<00:01:46.600> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
it's all being scanned of correctly and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.120 
it's all being scanned of correctly and
I'll<00:01:46.899> show<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> final<00:01:47.500> result<00:01:47.860> when<00:01:48.009> it's

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
I'll show the final result when it's

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.279 
I'll show the final result when it's
finished<00:01:48.460> I'm<00:01:49.270> gonna<00:01:49.450> pause<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.960> video<00:01:50.229> now

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
finished I'm gonna pause the video now

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.380 
finished I'm gonna pause the video now
and<00:01:50.409> just<00:01:50.770> let<00:01:50.950> let<00:01:51.159> this<00:01:51.310> much<00:01:51.909> through<00:01:52.149> it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and just let let this much through it's

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.880 
and just let let this much through it's
been<00:01:52.539> a<00:01:52.570> couple<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.930> minutes<00:01:53.259> I'm<00:01:53.470> currently

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
been a couple of minutes I'm currently

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.639 
been a couple of minutes I'm currently
on<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.130> third<00:01:54.310> batch<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:55.479> page<00:01:56.049> greater

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
on the third batch it's page greater

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.090 
on the third batch it's page greater
than<00:01:56.829> 18<00:01:57.159> at<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.580> end<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.799> as<00:01:59.920> you<00:01:59.979> can

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
than 18 at the end of this so as you can

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.070 
than 18 at the end of this so as you can
see<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.700> an<00:02:01.179> extremely<00:02:01.360> fast<00:02:01.929> and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
see this is an extremely fast and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560 
see this is an extremely fast and
extremely<00:02:02.289> efficient<00:02:02.860> way<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.210> scan<00:02:04.210> there's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
extremely efficient way to scan there's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.760 
extremely efficient way to scan there's
nothing<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> talk<00:02:04.899> about<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.380> colors<00:02:05.649> are

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
nothing to talk about the colors are

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.440 
nothing to talk about the colors are
setting<00:02:06.070> at<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.280> moment<00:02:06.579> it's<00:02:06.700> set<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
setting at the moment it's set to the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.990 
setting at the moment it's set to the
high<00:02:07.659> setting<00:02:08.349> then<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.489> see<00:02:09.640> how<00:02:09.729> fast

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
high setting then you can see how fast

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.300 
high setting then you can see how fast
the<00:02:10.149> pages<00:02:10.479> are<00:02:10.569> coming<00:02:10.840> out<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.050> is<00:02:11.230> 300<00:02:11.950> dpi

sometimes<00:03:31.810> especially<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.560> on<00:03:33.190> thicker<00:03:33.609> pages

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
sometimes especially on on thicker pages

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.840 
sometimes especially on on thicker pages
bear<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.590> mind<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:35.859> is<00:03:35.950> quite<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> thick<00:03:36.549> cover

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
bear in mind this is quite a thick cover

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.140 
bear in mind this is quite a thick cover
plus<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.680> shiny<00:03:38.889> reflective<00:03:39.430> color<00:03:39.790> so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
plus it's a shiny reflective color so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.550 
plus it's a shiny reflective color so
you<00:03:40.510> know<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:40.750> kind<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.019> still<00:03:41.260> did<00:03:41.440> an

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you know this kind of still did an

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.620 
you know this kind of still did an
amazing<00:03:41.829> job<00:03:42.069> I'm<00:03:42.430> quite<00:03:43.000> happy<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.510> even

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
amazing job I'm quite happy with it even

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.740 
amazing job I'm quite happy with it even
though<00:03:43.780> there<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.639> of<00:03:45.880> cyan

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
though there is that that bit of cyan

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.539 
though there is that that bit of cyan
above<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.290> lowest<00:03:47.440> okay<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:47.950> now<00:03:48.220> we<00:03:48.280> need<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
above the lowest okay so now we need to

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.490 
above the lowest okay so now we need to
stitch<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.940> document<00:03:49.359> together<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:50.019> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
stitch the document together and the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.280 
stitch the document together and the
easiest<00:03:50.769> way<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.280> I've<00:03:51.519> found<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.569> open

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
easiest way that I've found is to open

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.520 
easiest way that I've found is to open
one<00:03:53.620> document

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
one document

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.310 
one document
okay<00:03:55.130> then<00:03:55.370> open<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.660> know<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.870> rest<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.200> the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
okay then open you know the rest of the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.100 
okay then open you know the rest of the
documents<00:03:58.070> in<00:03:58.130> another<00:03:58.400> window<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:58.970> there<00:03:59.960> we

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
documents in another window so there we

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.570 
documents in another window so there we
go<00:04:01.690> if<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:02.780> show<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.380> sidebar<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.190> single

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
go if we show the sidebar of the single

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.060 
go if we show the sidebar of the single
document<00:04:05.060> as<00:04:05.120> well<00:04:05.300> so<00:04:06.080> that's<00:04:06.200> that's<00:04:06.710> 87

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
document as well so that's that's 87

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.030 
document as well so that's that's 87
pages<00:04:07.760> here<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.870> add<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.320> remainder<00:04:09.650> all

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
pages here and to add the remainder all

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.240 
pages here and to add the remainder all
we<00:04:10.220> do<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.640> select<00:04:11.260> all<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.440> pages<00:04:12.800> from<00:04:12.920> from

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
we do is select all the pages from from

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.890 
we do is select all the pages from from
the<00:04:13.370> other<00:04:13.490> window<00:04:13.820> from<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.030> sidebar<00:04:14.600> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
the other window from the sidebar and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.840 
the other window from the sidebar and
just<00:04:15.290> drag<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.740> across<00:04:15.800> you'll<00:04:16.400> see<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.579> little

can you can see that it's it's the full
428<00:04:36.200> pages<00:04:36.590> which<00:04:36.740> is<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.980> entire<00:04:37.220> book<00:04:38.140> okay

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
dots so you know even a 300 dpi this is

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.670 
dots so you know even a 300 dpi this is
this<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.540> than<00:04:47.660> enough<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.230> if<00:04:48.410> it's<00:04:48.530> not

this is more than enough and if it's not

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.350 
this is more than enough and if it's not
enough<00:04:48.890> for<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.580> can<00:04:49.850> set<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.120> scanner

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
enough for you you can set the scanner

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.110 
enough for you you can set the scanner
to<00:04:50.450> higher<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.800> now<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:51.980> final<00:04:52.220> step<00:04:52.730> we<00:04:53.030> want

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
to higher so now the final step we want

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.330 
to higher so now the final step we want
to<00:04:53.270> be<00:04:53.360> able<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:53.810> copy<00:04:53.930> paste<00:04:54.130> code<00:04:55.130> a
