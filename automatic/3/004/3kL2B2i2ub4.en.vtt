00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
Mexico have been struggling of late I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
Mexico have been struggling of late I
mean<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.689> used<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> dominate<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> CONCACAF

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
mean they used to dominate the CONCACAF

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
mean they used to dominate the CONCACAF
region<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.299> they've<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> through

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
region but now they've had to go through

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
region but now they've had to go through
players<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> World<00:01:20.340> Cup<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
players to get to the World Cup so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
players to get to the World Cup so
they've<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.080> struggling<00:01:22.290> cameroon

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they've really been struggling cameroon

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
they've really been struggling cameroon
are<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.790> capitalize<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> if

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
are gonna have to capitalize on that if

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
are gonna have to capitalize on that if
they<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.920> think

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they want to really do what I think

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
they want to really do what I think
that's<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> easier

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's probably going to be the easier

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
that's probably going to be the easier
game<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.890> no<00:01:29.070> easy<00:01:29.250> games<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
game there are no easy games but if I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
had to say call the easy game for them

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
had to say call the easy game for them
that<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> best<00:01:32.790> chance<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.299> against

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that the best chance would be against

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
that the best chance would be against
Mexico<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.500> against<00:01:34.770> Croatia<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.159> Brazilian

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Mexico not against Croatia or Brazilian

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
Mexico not against Croatia or Brazilian
nothing<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.299> against<00:01:36.750> those<00:01:36.930> two<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
nothing but against those two they can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.050 
nothing but against those two they can
it's<00:01:37.829> gonna<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> tough<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.520> alright<00:01:38.850> let's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it's gonna be a tough game alright let's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's gonna be a tough game alright let's
see<00:01:39.210> our<00:01:39.420> predictions<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:39.990> grouper<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> would

see our predictions for grouper I would

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
see our predictions for grouper I would
probably<00:01:41.520> say<00:01:41.729> Brazil<00:01:42.240> Croatia<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
probably say Brazil Croatia if I have to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.280 
probably say Brazil Croatia if I have to
it<00:01:43.710> breaks<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.189> heart<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> say<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> but

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
spain against Netherlands this one

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
spain against Netherlands this one
promises<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.890> absolute<00:01:59.250> cracker<00:01:59.369> er<00:01:59.969> no

promises to be an absolute cracker er no

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
promises to be an absolute cracker er no
definitely<00:02:00.570> there's<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.930> many<00:02:01.049> groups<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
definitely there's so many groups of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
definitely there's so many groups of
death<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.369> drawer<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
death in this drawer and this is one of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.250 
death in this drawer and this is one of
them<00:02:04.280> spain<00:02:05.280> netherlands<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> be

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
them spain netherlands is going to be

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.350 
them spain netherlands is going to be
thing<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.620> would<00:02:07.830> say<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.220> mean<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:09.180> last

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
thing I would say I mean if the last

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
thing I would say I mean if the last
world<00:02:09.630> cup<00:02:09.660> final<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.200> anything<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.680> go<00:02:10.710> by<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
world cup final is anything to go by and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
world cup final is anything to go by and
I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.820> for<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I think for them this is going to be a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
I think for them this is going to be a
key<00:02:13.050> game<00:02:13.200> because<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> loser<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.310> game

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
key game because the loser in this game

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.310 
key game because the loser in this game
is<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.240> be<00:02:15.300> under<00:02:15.630> pressure<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:16.110> well

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is going to be under pressure as well

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.050 
is going to be under pressure as well
because<00:02:16.560> Chile<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> very<00:02:17.370> good<00:02:17.610> team<00:02:17.790> as<00:02:17.940> well

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
because Chile a very good team as well

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
because Chile a very good team as well
so<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.780> any<00:02:18.990> if<00:02:19.230> either<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.740> them<00:02:19.950> loses

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so if any if either one of them loses

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.010 
so if any if either one of them loses
this<00:02:20.520> game<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.940> under<00:02:21.270> pressure<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.810> their

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
this game they under pressure in their

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.320 
this game they under pressure in their
games<00:02:22.260> against<00:02:22.680> Chile<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.130> Australia<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.850> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
games against Chile and Australia and so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.400 
games against Chile and Australia and so
that<00:02:24.510> could<00:02:24.690> make<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.990> group<00:02:25.230> really

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
that could make this group really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
that could make this group really
interesting<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.310> could<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.060> giant

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
interesting and we could see a giant

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440 
interesting and we could see a giant
going<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.200> early<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:29.190> sundo<00:02:29.700> basically

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
going out early really sundo basically

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360 
going out early really sundo basically
Australia<00:02:30.960> are<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> whipping

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
Australia are going to be the whipping

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.880 
Australia are going to be the whipping
boys<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.700> hey<00:02:32.880> um<00:02:33.150> yeah<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.050> late<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.740> you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
boys here hey um yeah of late if you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.710 
boys here hey um yeah of late if you
look<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.250> build-up<00:02:35.760> games<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.360> well<00:02:36.510> they

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
look at the build-up games as well they

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.410 
look at the build-up games as well they
didn't<00:02:37.350> inspire<00:02:37.680> much<00:02:37.980> confidence<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
didn't inspire much confidence so I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.610 
didn't inspire much confidence so I
think<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:39.930> would<00:02:40.110> probably<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
think they would probably be the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.800 
think they would probably be the
whooping<00:02:40.920> boys<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> group<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.270> Chile

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
whooping boys of the group and Chile

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.450 
whooping boys of the group and Chile
have<00:02:42.990> looked<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:43.680> good<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:43.980> their<00:02:44.250> build

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
have looked really good in their build

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.760 
have looked really good in their build
up<00:02:44.640> games<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.600> between<00:02:46.110> netherlands

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
up games so I think between netherlands

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.590 
up games so I think between netherlands
spain<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.250> chile<00:02:47.310> we're<00:02:47.970> gonna<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.390> some

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
spain and chile we're gonna have some

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
spain and chile we're gonna have some
really<00:02:48.810> interesting<00:02:49.560> times<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.250> your

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
really interesting times in your

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.390 
really interesting times in your
prediction<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.150> ah<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.860> tough<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.220> but

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
prediction here ah it's a tough one but

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
they've been in the group groups of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.520 
they've been in the group groups of
death<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.540> they've<00:03:39.720> had<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.050> really<00:03:40.230> tough

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.740 
death and so they've had it really tough
and<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.160> I'm<00:03:41.310> hoping<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.269> know<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.570> is

and so I'm hoping that you know this is
an<00:03:42.870> easier<00:03:43.200> draw<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:44.100> them<00:03:44.220> compared<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
an easier draw for them compared to the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.449 
an easier draw for them compared to the
previous<00:03:45.570> World<00:03:45.840> Cups<00:03:45.900> they've<00:03:46.200> been<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.130> I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
they're really gonna have to dig deep in

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.340 
they're really gonna have to dig deep in
order<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.970> come<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.540> group<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:15.930> i<00:04:16.230> do

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
order to come out of the group but i do

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.080 
order to come out of the group but i do
believe<00:04:16.620> they<00:04:16.889> have<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.130> ability<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.760> do<00:04:17.970> it

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
believe they have the ability to do it

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.759 
believe they have the ability to do it
and<00:04:18.209> i<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.299> they<00:04:18.630> will<00:04:18.810> colombia<00:04:19.500> being<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
and i think they will colombia being the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.930 
and i think they will colombia being the
highest<00:04:19.950> ranked<00:04:20.340> team

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
highest ranked team

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.090 
highest ranked team
should<00:04:21.209> do<00:04:21.330> very<00:04:21.480> well<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:21.860> Columbia<00:04:22.860> yeah

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
should do very well here Columbia yeah

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.820 
should do very well here Columbia yeah
but<00:04:23.520> they've<00:04:24.000> rested<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.200> lot<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.500> their<00:04:25.620> hopes

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
but they've rested a lot of their hopes

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.310 
but they've rested a lot of their hopes
on<00:04:26.070> radamel<00:04:26.820> falcao<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.450> he's<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:28.080> available

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
on radamel falcao and he's not available

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.380 
on radamel falcao and he's not available
for<00:04:28.770> them<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.310> think<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.090> might

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
for them and I think that that might

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.830 
for them and I think that that might
count<00:04:30.840> against<00:04:31.230> them<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.330> big<00:04:33.570> loss<00:04:33.810> for

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
count against them it's a big loss for

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.260 
count against them it's a big loss for
them<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:34.950> for<00:04:35.280> me<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.640> this<00:04:35.790> group<00:04:36.090> I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
them and so for me in this group I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.750 
them and so for me in this group I
actually<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.810> think<00:04:36.900> Japan<00:04:37.500> are<00:04:38.070> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> come

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
actually I think Japan are going to come

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.830 
actually I think Japan are going to come
through<00:04:38.790> because<00:04:39.090> they've<00:04:39.420> looked<00:04:39.690> really

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
through because they've looked really

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.660 
through because they've looked really
solid<00:04:40.230> in<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.440> last<00:04:40.680> year<00:04:40.920> japan<00:04:41.130> have<00:04:41.460> played

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
solid in the last year japan have played

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.720 
solid in the last year japan have played
and<00:04:41.940> november<00:04:42.780> i<00:04:42.840> think<00:04:43.020> because<00:04:43.200> they<00:04:43.350> played

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
and november i think because they played

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.370 
and november i think because they played
against<00:04:44.730> holland<00:04:44.910> they<00:04:45.300> drew<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.690> all<00:04:45.870> they

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
against holland they drew to all they

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.890 
against holland they drew to all they
beat<00:04:46.620> Belgium<00:04:47.250> who<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> mean<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> really<00:04:48.540> quality

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
beat Belgium who I mean a really quality

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.020 
beat Belgium who I mean a really quality
team<00:04:49.170> as<00:04:49.380> well<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.980> Japan<00:04:50.220> have<00:04:50.700> put<00:04:50.880> together

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
team as well so Japan have put together

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.490 
team as well so Japan have put together
a<00:04:51.270> really<00:04:51.480> good<00:04:51.750> team<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.140> think<00:04:52.350> they're

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
a really good team and I think they're

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.660 
a really good team and I think they're
gonna<00:04:52.650> they're<00:04:52.920> going<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.220> be<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.310> team<00:04:53.520> to

Uruguay Italy and England have won the
world<00:05:26.370> cup<00:05:26.430> before<00:05:26.700> so<00:05:27.390> this<00:05:27.600> is<00:05:27.780> also<00:05:27.960> a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
world cup before so this is also a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.650 
world cup before so this is also a
really<00:05:28.590> tough<00:05:28.800> group<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.250> call<00:05:29.490> for<00:05:30.480> me

really tough group to call for me

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.700 
really tough group to call for me
Uruguay<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.620> probably<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.160> best<00:05:33.000> team<00:05:33.710> they

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
Uruguay is probably the best team they

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.650 
Uruguay is probably the best team they
haven't<00:05:35.130> been<00:05:35.490> convincing<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.210> qualifying

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
haven't been convincing and qualifying

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.420 
haven't been convincing and qualifying
but<00:05:36.930> they<00:05:37.140> are<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.440> team<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.740> rises<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.400> the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
but they are a team that rises to the

but they are a team that rises to the
occasion<00:05:38.550> they've<00:05:39.510> shown<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.930> at<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.169> 2010

World<00:05:56.340> Cup<00:05:56.460> but<00:05:56.669> I<00:05:57.419> think<00:05:57.810> oreg<00:05:58.080> wise<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.290> team

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
World Cup but I think oreg wise a team

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.150 
World Cup but I think oreg wise a team
to<00:05:58.830> watch<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.220> england<00:05:59.850> and<00:06:00.360> italy<00:06:00.540> a

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
to watch the england and italy a

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.500 
to watch the england and italy a
relatively<00:06:02.160> evenly<00:06:02.580> matched<00:06:02.850> but<00:06:03.360> i<00:06:03.390> think

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
relatively evenly matched but i think

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.930 
relatively evenly matched but i think
italy<00:06:04.080> will<00:06:04.290> will<00:06:05.010> come<00:06:05.220> through<00:06:05.490> based<00:06:05.790> on

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
italy will will come through based on

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.510 
italy will will come through based on
the<00:06:06.030> experience<00:06:06.540> they've<00:06:07.350> been<00:06:07.710> they<00:06:08.160> won<00:06:08.400> the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
the experience they've been they won the

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.909 
the experience they've been they won the
06<00:06:08.910> final<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.419> they<00:06:09.870> they<00:06:10.110> got<00:06:10.140> to<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.560> final

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
06 final and they they got to the final

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.370 
06 final and they they got to the final
of<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.040> 2012<00:06:11.880> european<00:06:12.360> championships<00:06:12.930> so

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
of the 2012 european championships so

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.480 
of the 2012 european championships so
they've<00:06:13.530> got<00:06:13.560> players<00:06:13.950> who've<00:06:14.250> been<00:06:14.460> there

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
they've got players who've been there

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.730 
they've got players who've been there
and<00:06:14.880> i<00:06:15.540> think<00:06:15.750> that<00:06:15.930> will<00:06:16.140> count<00:06:16.380> in<00:06:16.620> their

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
and i think that will count in their

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.740 
and i think that will count in their
