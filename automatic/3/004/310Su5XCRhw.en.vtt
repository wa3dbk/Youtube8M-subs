00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.889
 how should become another 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.030
 gameplay commentary falls from me first 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.760
 give you a little bit a little something 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.830
 Gameplay tell us what the whole 57er 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.690
 very trick this time he plays on the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.670
 Playstation 3 is nothing now 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.260
 particularly high or something but it is 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.030
 just a little info video is a few 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.560
 tell things and I thought so 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.540
 This gameplay is definitely enough 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.519
 to you can I guess quite well 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.469
 maybe giving in the background too 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.480
 in between times better than just around 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.059
 find a donation with some streeps 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.829
 me and yes in any case the first thing 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.199
 I wanted to appeal to a lot of people 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.539
 have always asked me yes think jesse 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.319
 hate ts server or which ts server 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.449
 do you always want 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.730
 and yes, I never had one 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.559
 and now, by chance, have me 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.530
 really great cool people wrote the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.629
 the whole thing now too fresh and new 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.179
 have started and now written 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.530
 whether you can sponsor me or 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.940
 Anyway, and there I have 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.100
 of course, directly yes said the whole 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.689
 for me but only great possibility 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.060
 is the daisy with my people 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.009
 recordings simply better 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.689
 white yellow is always there 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.520
 one flies out constantly and then is 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.320
 one in the game it's just totally off there 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 you have to restart the call and that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.860
 that just does not work so well 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.390
 together again a teamspeak of 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 everything is super fluid and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.719
 I can do that before anything else 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.090
 So I usually camp with you 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.000
 then in the evening only the online was with too 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.869
 Daisy games or something in between 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.399
 but that's how I find myself 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.109
 Coolers can subscribe to each other 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.729
 talk i came to chat with you and 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.030
 actually a very nice thing 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.030
 and my ip-address no ip-address 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 The link below is the whole one 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.539
 just a jesse massacre 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.740
 punkt.de as I am actually 1000th 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.679
 better times I have to say honestly 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.210
 ip-address because yes all the time can 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.310
 you look the same way you notice 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.320
 saves then as a favorite 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.450
 Or so if you just like that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.219
 just because she is not somewhere and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.840
 just the ip is not quite at hand 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.179
 then you can just do the massacre 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.679
 Enter dot de and then it'll work 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.350
 already so I think so quite 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.700
 super cool trainer murat feel 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.200
 and yes, that's how I like it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 the people told me for sure 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.590
 they are also natural 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 right at the top of the video 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.090
 description with my 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.200
 quotes ip-address linked there 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.970
 you also like to be happy 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.890
 have a look at the rent 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
 for example, teamspeak servers, etc. are just 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.490
 really new at the start must first 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.620
 be known a little bit and 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.210
 That 's why I say that on the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.410
 if you are interested in it 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.110
 can you really on the walls are 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.820
 super nice all and yes makes on everyone 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.440
 case are then still another 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.240
 thing with daisy i have to one 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.250
 last faq still talked about that 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.990
 I will come after several others 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.670
 will all but not here 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.340
 I think it's worth it 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.310
 so much sense the whole call of duty and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.270
 now she and so much too 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.610
 miss 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.290
 and that's why I'll just go 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.210
 Make it another channel anyway 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.120
 a fraction of my subscribers here 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.450
 About 1000 people are around the day 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.220
 want to see and therefore want 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.890
 I say as I said makes a lot 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 sense and I will continue to record myself 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.080
 will continue to upload then but me 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 I'll make it to 9 channel 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.660
 I do not know when I'll create it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.200
 but will be surprised anyway 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.240
 Not 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.160
 for those who want to see this here 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.020
 small at first none of them come as 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.760
 said i will make new channel and 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.220
 then the whole thing is derived 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.230
 then the question often came up 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.240
 which this six against six with 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 subscribers had spoken that I did 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.140
 even as a series would like to bring 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.580
 on which console I do it all 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.050
 I will the comments though already 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.120
 answered but it was still like 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.680
 10,000 times asked and because 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.670
 I do it on both consoles 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.050
 I do not know exactly where in the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.700
 I'll set up play station 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.950
 that really is still totally stupid 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.660
 that you have to have people as a friend around 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.550
 invite you to the game 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.750
 but yes somehow it will already be 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.760
 I do not know yet 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.260
 exactly when I will start with it 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.630
 I will definitely do that 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920
 more likely to inform 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.720
 facebook or something 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.270
 otherwise I have just a few more 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.680
 new series planned for you i hope 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.510
 just that you are fine 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010
 like your topics answer yes already 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.000
 a new series about this so far really 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.830
 arrived super 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.880
 and yes, I'm just curious 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.660
 if I like them but me 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.310
 I think so 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.900
 I think the gameplay is the same 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.060
 already over all that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.030
 I wanted to briefly tell you shortly 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.389
 so the latest 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.590
 news and stuff and in the next video 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.210
 will definitely come back to your face 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.720
 camp comments because I already have 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.400
 times before also produces a question or 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.320
 a topic that quite often 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.100
 has been addressed but I tell you 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.840
 I too much 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.840
 I'll just say nice with oil
