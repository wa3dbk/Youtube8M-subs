00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 firstly congratulations 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.170
 ten wins in ten qualifiers 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 the duty was a qualification 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.240
 already done so today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.430
 a small door 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.320
 we want the last game too 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.350
 win 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.940
 we have succeeded well globally some 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.000
 we gave everything 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.000
 a little bit of difficulty after 1 so 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.770
 he came back into the game what we did 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.360
 we can and will we want together 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.220
 the last three countries play four goals 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.300
 So they did that too 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.430
 little bit of efficiency and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.530
 effectiveness learned at mourinho 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.780
 at real madrid 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.980
 Of course, I'll join myself, of course 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 the conclusion 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.710
 in madrid for my self-confidence 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 fronter of course I am happy that 1 0 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.740
 have made 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.630
 I'm just so happy about it 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.150
 Turkey is about to end 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.280
 how such a double for you today 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.300
 successful day if it should work 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.620
 with the qualification for the relegation 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.540
 In any case, I am of course happy 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.180
 I had many friends for that 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.710
 fourth example i have a lot of friends 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.780
 Here in Germany 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 For this turkey press the thumb 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.820
 of course hope you like the game 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.530
 win and congratulate confidently 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.200
 again sovereign victory again to 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.790
 statements of qualification em you can 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.380
 at all a bit of criticism 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.300
 attach or say yourself today 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.220
 just that in my last game 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.600
 in the tenth qualifier again 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 so dominant occurs that all 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.950
 Honorable is , of course , all honors 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.210
 worth if you especially to the balance sheet 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.980
 See if you win all ten games 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.690
 Has 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.800
 The dots once exist believe that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.320
 we have come heavily into play the 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.910
 first 20 minutes and hard to do 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.590
 that was of course a catastrophic one 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.360
 It was a bit sad here 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 is already playing at home but good 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 you have to have a bit through that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.430
 but used as a game then 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.230
 were gratefully played and reasonably 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.700
 made the gates and rendered outstanding 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.200
 Much is going on over these days 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.870
 Competition also talked with 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 look at the european championship 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.720
 the name is always associated with them 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.980
 khedira is that a real duel 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.410
 on the sixth position 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.560
 two are not my position is not 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.000
 exactly who said trainer no 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 I think that lately 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 just my team a good one 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.910
 performance and I think that has 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 Since the federal coach has registered and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.450
 he knows what he brings banker 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.620
 Thomas Müller they have before the game 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.210
 We will definitely not say that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.560
 larifari play but then he must 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.420
 actually after the last play rather 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.600
 the national team can ask something else 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.910
 other than spectacular buffers should be back 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.610
 working well is difficult in the game 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.020
 come 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.210
 but next to the action we had 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.050
 we were single-minded and 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.250
 were equally dangerous in front of the corner 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.080
 from the 10 already thormann 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 so we were dangerously forward in 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.570
 all actions 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.000
 and that was the key thinking on 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.250
 already let see that they already 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.440
 want and that you had to give gas 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.660
 little problem again a new one 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.160
 formed team but as you can see 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.050
 that does not matter to us at the moment 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.030
 and it 's just a nice one now 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.130
 So actually managed ten wins in 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.600
 ten play what speaks in the stand today 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.740
 still against that after the record 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.270
 Qualification also a record wm comes 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.190
 i believe the dutch and the spanish 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.050
 All have won their games 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 or had the chance before that 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.080
 So then you have to play 3 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.760
 So we have to give European champions 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.950
 still 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.110
 first play the em and then times 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
 see what comes out but yes we do 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.080
 well we ready we are happy 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.080
 was all good 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.120
 Andre Schürrle initially 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.160
 congratulations that was in principle a 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.599
 Em-application plays for you personally 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.849
 then you have your first book today 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.420
 It's done at the beginning. What's your name? 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.450
 Conclusion 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.910
 I think the team has a lot 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.200
 focused, I believe we 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.970
 have a very good team though 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.769
 also at the beginning very much pressure 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.360
 but we have so much quality 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.470
 in the team and that's what you have today 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.540
 again we can see from the nothing 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.580
 make goals and he still has huge 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.690
 chance believes that with three goals 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.360
 pictures also be well served 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.099
 keyword gates with five gates made in 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.019
 ten country games in how far can you 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.799
 because of a point victory over Lukas 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:17.940
 podolski always talk about this question 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.109
 apolda is but who makes such gates there 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.299
 You can ask for it because it 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.479
 was very nice a gate of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.860
 upscale kind of alike I want me 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.260
 Of course, the trainer always offer 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.340
 if i get the chance im 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.560
 I think I've been fine so far 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.880
 but hopes that I will 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.460
 also continue to play from the beginning 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.680
 that is clearly the goal of each of us 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.660
 in the squad and so is also mainz of therefore 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.229
 we'll see in the end had to coach 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.400
 decide 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.200
 The coach then decides next 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.479
 year in may so eight months are still there 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.610
 such a good feeling that you are so em 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.199
 Candidate are a safer 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.550
 yes what does that mean is safe 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.780
 Candidates there may still be so much 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.240
 there are still so many games going on 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.490
 as many months as they said from 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.780
 Therefore , I feel as a full-fledged 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.849
 Member of the team feel very much 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.740
 well here and he just try mine 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.780
 to bring power and then it works 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.629
 been to all the best to transactions 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.490
 sold yes manuel new long sentence after 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.599
 a perfect evening for her, too 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.550
 what is a greater joy now 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.439
 over the three gates in front or the trouble 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.449
 over this late counterpart was the 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.009
 joy about the three points first and 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.330
 Of course, over the gates but one 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.979
 annoyed anyway the goat 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.289
 Why Germany can no longer 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.210
 play zero at the bavaria works 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.710
 wonderful works in any case 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.150
 I think we can do it when 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.889
 It would not have been a failure of concentration 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.219
 for the corner may come normally 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.930
 but I think the player of mountains 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.330
 was also very big, good at the ball 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.889
 We can in fact block the front and was 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.479
 for me too far forward and been 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.090
 your money exactly when comes from marco reus 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.949
 even switzerland still defend one 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.310
 Record qualification is done perfectly 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.719
 been 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.340
 would you say that the defense is the 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:53.440
 defensively connected also the last one 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.509
 Construction site is the leftover 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.129
 to work on in the next 2 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:01.120
 148 days until then continue 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.750
 the defensive is also very good 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.669
 worked 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.529
 you have to see that we are also earlier 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.560
 attack we defend already in front 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.969
 and put the opponent on the 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.830
 already half under pressure 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.900
 and the defenders must also be high 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.460
 stand and get difficulties 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.599
 and at the world championship we have 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.819
 already seen that we have little goal 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.139
 have gotten and a big one 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.389
 there is no progress 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.159
 thank you very much manuel new philipp lame 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.479
 Congrats on the victory Congratulations on the 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.979
 record they were the oldest today 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.750
 player from german view on the 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.389
 space because what says the father to herberg 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.129
 this record is sensational if you can 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.539
 look at the history and now the 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.210
 team managed ten games 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.800
 ten victories is impressive we have 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.479
 It was hard at the beginning of the day but it did 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.490
 shows the quality of the team that 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.870
 Then we'll be big too 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.370
 can work out scoring opportunities that we 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.870
 i think four in the first half 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.240
 have huge damage where we alone before 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.979
 tor stand and that is also quality 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.330
 the team because offensive everything like that 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.490
 Yes, we have the hair in the well 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.229
 soup search and find the goverment you 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.000
 have an alibi she was not up anymore 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.910
 the place but still why can 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.890
 no longer play germany to zero 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.250
 something we still have to improve and 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.750
 since a starting point that we again 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.460
 have to look that we just over 90 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.530
 Concentrated play minutes I think 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.440
 I do not believe that belgium before that 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.630
 Giant chance has that in the beginning 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.460
 first quarter of an hour superior to 20 minutes 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.160
 but were not good torschuss had 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.870
 and I think it was a corner then 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.660
 It could also lead to the goal 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.710
 especially when it is 30 248 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.120
 days are still up to 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.740
 european championship what else is there 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.910
 improve 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.290
 you can improve here getting anywhere 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.910
 also our game today especially in the 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.110
 first 20 minutes than belgium 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.900
 came out is very much pressure 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.880
 made everything come on devil 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.500
 then you have to relax 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.570
 then I have to move more 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.090
 who also find the free people and that 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.840
 we also missed today and defensive 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.800
 we can all do even better 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.270
 work together 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.430
 that has also shown the past 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.470
 but a total of ten play ten 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.790
 You can be very satisfied with winning 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.790
 In any case many thanks philipp lame
