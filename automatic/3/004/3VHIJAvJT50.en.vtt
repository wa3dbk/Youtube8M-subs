 I never imagined that the recordings would go over a dozen or so, 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.270
 The bottom is still alive, and it's slender and I can talk. 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.770

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.900

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:26.570
 It's a little bit of evidence, because it's plastic wrapped with heat.

 Besides the fact that as an open feel less harmful to the human body stores its well 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.139
