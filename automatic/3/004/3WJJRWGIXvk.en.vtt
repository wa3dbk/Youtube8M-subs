you know in order to say go dry mouth
and<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.329> it's<00:00:33.170> all<00:00:33.290> downhill<00:00:33.530> from<00:00:33.890> there<00:00:34.100> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280

and it it's all downhill from there and
then<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:34.489> have<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:34.730> moment<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:35.420> you

then you have that moment and then you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.710 
then you have that moment and then you
screw<00:00:35.870> it<00:00:35.960> up<00:00:36.080> and<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.680> don't<00:00:37.580> know<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:38.330> think

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
screw it up and I don't know I think

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600 
screw it up and I don't know I think
it's<00:00:39.170> because<00:00:39.500> more<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:39.920> her<00:00:40.070> characters

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
it's because more of her characters

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.910 
it's because more of her characters
she's<00:00:40.850> been<00:00:41.090> very<00:00:41.239> shut<00:00:42.170> off<00:00:42.290> because<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.770> her

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
she's been very shut off because of her

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.390 
she's been very shut off because of her
past<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.460> what's<00:00:43.579> happened<00:00:43.879> in<00:00:44.000> her<00:00:44.120> life<00:00:44.150> and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
past and what's happened in her life and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.910 
past and what's happened in her life and
not<00:00:46.400> very<00:00:46.580> accessible<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.540> think<00:00:48.290> he<00:00:48.620> hadn't

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
not very accessible I think he hadn't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.830 
not very accessible I think he hadn't
had<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.160> confidence<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.730> go<00:00:49.879> on

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.529 

the<00:00:54.170> beacon<00:00:54.500> of<00:00:54.590> hope<00:00:54.820> which<00:00:55.820> is<00:00:56.000> kind<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.390> what

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
the beacon of hope which is kind of what

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.000 
the beacon of hope which is kind of what
it's<00:00:56.660> written<00:00:56.780> as<00:00:57.020> is<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:57.770> guy<00:00:57.949> who

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's written as is like this guy who

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.970 
it's written as is like this guy who
just<00:00:58.780> really<00:00:59.780> just<00:00:59.960> believes<00:01:00.320> in<00:01:00.440> love<00:01:00.649> like

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
just really just believes in love like

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.220 
just really just believes in love like
you<00:01:01.430> know<00:01:01.550> we<00:01:01.730> grow<00:01:01.969> cynical<00:01:02.839> as<00:01:02.930> we<00:01:03.050> grow

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
you know we grow cynical as we grow

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.180 
you know we grow cynical as we grow
older<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.150> love<00:01:05.150> becomes<00:01:05.950> more<00:01:06.950> about

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
older and love becomes more about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.520 
older and love becomes more about
partnership<00:01:07.940> than<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.810> purity<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.409> we

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
partnership than that purity that we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.740 
partnership than that purity that we
have<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.070> child<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:11.270> think<00:01:11.540> that's

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
have is like a child and I think that's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.930 
have is like a child and I think that's
what<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.470> know<00:01:12.619> me<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.009> her<00:01:13.250> wanted<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.729> bring

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.820 
what you know me and her wanted to bring
back<00:01:14.119> like<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.509> childlike<00:01:14.899> emotion<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:15.649> just

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
back like that childlike emotion of just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.760 
back like that childlike emotion of just
come<00:01:16.299> purely<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.450> thinking<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:18.020> with<00:01:18.619> your

heart

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 

I<00:01:22.980> just<00:01:23.460> went<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.730> childhood<00:01:24.090> why<00:01:24.480> from

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I just went back to childhood why from

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
I just went back to childhood why from
all<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.410> Crushers<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.980> had<00:01:26.160> as<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.400> kid<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
all the Crushers that I had as a kid and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.800 
all the Crushers that I had as a kid and
and<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.470> ever<00:01:29.310> gone<00:01:29.520> anywhere<00:01:29.970> which

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and if they had ever gone anywhere which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
and if they had ever gone anywhere which
they<00:01:30.990> never<00:01:31.110> did<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.550> just<00:01:32.580> played<00:01:33.300> out<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
they never did and just played out that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.680 
they never did and just played out that
fantasy<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:35.420> yeah<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
fantasy I think in that yeah it's so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.780 
fantasy I think in that yeah it's so
exciting<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.470> fall<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.340> someone<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
exciting to like fall for someone and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.730 
exciting to like fall for someone and
then<00:01:38.910> go<00:01:39.060> through<00:01:39.300> those<00:01:39.450> those<00:01:40.200> steps<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
then go through those those steps and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.139 
then go through those those steps and
those<00:01:40.830> motions<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.760 

it's<00:01:45.719> not<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.049> much<00:01:46.109> about<00:01:46.229> me

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's not so much about me

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
it's not so much about me
but<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.430> anyone<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
but I think it's about anyone that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.209 
but I think it's about anyone that
enters<00:01:48.119> into<00:01:48.509> their<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.560> their<00:01:49.679> circle

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
enters into their to their circle

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.969 
enters into their to their circle
because<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:50.969> they've<00:01:51.210> gone<00:01:51.450> through

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
because I think they've gone through

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.359 
because I think they've gone through
kind<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.219> difficult<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:54.030> years<00:01:55.369> because

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
kind of a difficult two years because

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.590 
kind of a difficult two years because
they've<00:01:56.610> lost<00:01:57.200> their<00:01:58.200> eldest<00:01:59.009> son

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
they've lost their eldest son

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.800 
they've lost their eldest son
yeah<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> oldest<00:02:01.289> Chris<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
yeah he is the oldest Chris and and I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.039 
yeah he is the oldest Chris and and I
guess<00:02:04.670> accepting<00:02:05.670> change<00:02:05.969> into<00:02:06.719> their<00:02:06.869> life

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
guess accepting change into their life

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.350 
guess accepting change into their life
and<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:08.069> Jake<00:02:08.429> growing<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.060> having<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and like Jake growing up and having a
