00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
parts to do because it's really hard to

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.050 
parts to do because it's really hard to
do<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.780> from<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.050> side<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.800> oh<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.729> Here<00:04:36.030> I

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.129 
am just adding that line that I have on
the<00:04:38.370> other<00:04:38.430> side<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.120> well<00:04:39.300> because<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.900> wanted

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
the other side as well because I wanted

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.680

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
to make it even and then just make the

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.230 
to make it even and then just make the
