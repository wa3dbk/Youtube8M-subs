00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.910 
below so that's that's two things the
food<00:03:26.280> we<00:03:26.459> cover<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.660> thoughts<00:03:27.989> i'm<00:03:28.530> sorry<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
food we cover the thoughts i'm sorry the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.760 
food we cover the thoughts i'm sorry the
exercise<00:03:29.400> that's<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.420> s3<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
exercise that's the s3 of the of the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.470 
exercise that's the s3 of the of the
blocks<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> new<00:03:32.610> cells<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.270> our<00:03:33.330> new

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
blocks of the new cells of our new

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.960 
blocks of the new cells of our new
program<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.860> rephrase<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.700> same

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
program I just rephrase it's the same

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.520 
program I just rephrase it's the same
stuff<00:03:36.270> i<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.600> use<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> common<00:03:37.050> pillars<00:03:37.350> but

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
stuff i just use the common pillars but

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.050 
stuff i just use the common pillars but
now<00:03:37.709> they're<00:03:37.920> called<00:03:38.130> blacks<00:03:38.459> building

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
now they're called blacks building

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.420 
now they're called blacks building
blocks<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.050> most<00:03:40.380> basic<00:03:40.650> building<00:03:40.980> block<00:03:41.280> is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
blocks the most basic building block is

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.520 
blocks the most basic building block is
the<00:03:41.580> human<00:03:41.850> cell<00:03:42.150> that's<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:42.660> new<00:03:42.810> thing<00:03:42.840> we're

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the human cell that's my new thing we're

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.840 
the human cell that's my new thing we're
gonna<00:03:43.680> get<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.920> cells<00:03:44.160> healthier<00:03:44.640> in<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
gonna get the cells healthier in the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.210 
gonna get the cells healthier in the
southern<00:03:45.269> level<00:03:45.570> organs<00:03:46.470> are<00:03:46.590> healthier<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
southern level organs are healthier the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.350 
southern level organs are healthier the
internal<00:03:47.580> organs<00:03:47.640> are<00:03:47.910> healthier<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
internal organs are healthier the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.880 
internal organs are healthier the
muscles<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.900> skeletal<00:03:49.290> system<00:03:49.410> healthier

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
muscles in the skeletal system healthier

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.190 
muscles in the skeletal system healthier
and<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.910> firm<00:03:51.420> foundation<00:03:51.630> that

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
and then you have a firm foundation that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.310 
and then you have a firm foundation that
you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.500> build<00:03:52.650> muscles<00:03:53.010> off<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.610> Lena's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
you can build muscles off of and Lena's

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.570 
you can build muscles off of and Lena's
so<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.830> takeaway<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:58.010> today<00:03:59.010> on

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
so the takeaway is that the today on

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.060 
so the takeaway is that the today on
exercise<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.660> trained<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.320> new<00:04:01.470> facility<00:04:01.650> or

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
exercise is trained in a new facility or

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.290 
exercise is trained in a new facility or
bounce<00:04:02.250> around<00:04:02.550> get<00:04:02.760> three<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.030> four

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
bounce around get three or four

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.880 
bounce around get three or four
different<00:04:03.570> places<00:04:03.900> called<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.590> Buddy<00:04:04.799> that

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
different places called the Buddy that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.710

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you know that looks great and say let's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.229 
you know that looks great and say let's
go<00:04:06.780> train<00:04:07.079> yourself<00:04:07.200> facility<00:04:07.860> variety<00:04:08.790> again

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
go train yourself facility variety again

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.729 
go train yourself facility variety again
is<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.690> spice<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.200> muscle<00:04:10.590> confusion

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
is the spice of like muscle confusion
