00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
together pretty good yep but I'm

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.850 
together pretty good yep but I'm
basically<00:03:13.120> thinking<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> same<00:03:13.810> thing<00:03:13.870> um<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
basically thinking the same thing um I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.470 
basically thinking the same thing um I
think<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.340> zoomed<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.030> no<00:03:16.120> reasons

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
think I just zoomed in for no reasons

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.630 
think I just zoomed in for no reasons
but<00:03:16.660> anyway<00:03:17.260> I'm<00:03:18.040> thinking<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.430> same<00:03:18.580> thing

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
but anyway I'm thinking the same thing

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.730 
but anyway I'm thinking the same thing
