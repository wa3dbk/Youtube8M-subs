 two 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 p 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.640
 we trust that in channel n and we are with the image 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.480
 and we are going to explain to you like a tsar 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.750
 an iron is called and happy you do not have to talk anymore 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.490
 currently one of the screens like 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.390
 the virgin what she is doing is passing 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 percent the plate with the speed continue 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 add this space 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.680
 it is important that it is not so fast 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 by the way one single pass we had 2 to be able to reaffirm 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.130
 xie can be used with a comb made with the tool you are using 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.400
 declaration 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 Benigni was asked for double 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.680
 the amount of hair that is being taken 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.290
 about one centimeter 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 of lorenzo 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.000
 by approximately 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 efe seven centimeters 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.290
 this has to be 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.940
 that approximately 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.880
 efe 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 Of course the grid has the school has one 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.830
 at the end of 105 600 are women 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.710
 They explained that the skater is the skateboard where the red part looks 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.660
 it is the part of peace where a temperature weapon is heated day 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.910
 the shares of fcc the store part in the internal part 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.620

 jack and are nine centimeters 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.510
 by all points driven that part is a is a surface 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.710
 can perfectly allowed us a temperature from 150 to two hundred 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.710
 twenty degrees centigrade depending on the model of the iron 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.580
 in this case that's an iron that is coming 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 at 220 degrees Celsius here you can see it's very important the kind of 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.679
 hair 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.099
 that kind of melilla as he said that they are good for leftovers 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.549
 in the way aggressive kuito is in fact one of the strongest processes this is 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 however we are not using the low temperature 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:32.209
 we are using a temperature 2 220 degrees centigrade why 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.469
 that is to say it has been mentioned that should still be the maximum temperature is 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:36.969
 should 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.329
 it is more advisable present was hair 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.840
 aquino sits well is a professional person where he does it very fast and 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:46.889
 in a way 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.549
 p 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.509
 it is not very simple 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:56.229
 Do not use it too much Do not use too much hair Do not leave too much is the iron 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.019
 about the hair is in a very 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.169
 I see it very firm 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.519
 and that makes you can see immediately that the hair take it 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.999
 readings a lot malaysia 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.329
 poetry nor as we are seeing here the dignitary that the English 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.139

 then talk to us with damage 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.229

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.779
 I was practicing mae 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.889
 of them about 10 that the humidity of the energy ciesa and little of 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.179
 confusion with this because it is the ladies 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.749
 in their houses seeing is that in reality what they are doing is a world 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.149
 in it from which steam escapes from the compensation process that is 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.999
 suffering the hair an initiation process obviously yes 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.980
 this has active traps water molecules 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.739
 What's in our in Toronto and deposit it inside the hair supplier 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.560
 some of these water molecules if they are reached to release and it's actually 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.540
 the same as us 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.430
 obama because we see military 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.739
 and the PRI 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.739
 yes efe 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 when it is really 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.420
 and apart from what we are seeing is that you do it in a more 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.430
 very soft in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.150
 reply us 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.449
 we always think of the house 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.919
 many passed 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.289
 chile is also art is a big mistake that the sun an error that sometimes 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.990
 gomez de la sra 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.870

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.550
 maqueda 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.530
 today when my biggest challenge commented how good we 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.639
 recommend 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.920
 one pass for 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.960
 somehow to prepare the way to do to grow and be better the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.449

 the products that are 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.460
 expenses before ironing why 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.839
 even when
