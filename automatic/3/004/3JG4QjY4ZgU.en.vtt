00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.320 

but<00:01:24.280> yeah<00:01:24.700> see<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.360> not<00:01:26.140> much<00:01:26.380> there

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:43.900

weight a little bit more weight it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:57.510 
weight a little bit more weight it's
probably<00:01:46.160> still<00:01:46.370> breaking<00:01:46.640> into

not<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.319> best<00:02:39.769> plastic<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:46.760> enough<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
not the best plastic it's just enough to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.240 
not the best plastic it's just enough to
leave<00:02:47.420> me<00:02:47.659> concern<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.799> can<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.220> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
what it can take and driveshafts I'll

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.030 
what it can take and driveshafts I'll
definitely<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.629> upgraded<00:03:00.040> transmission

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
definitely be upgraded transmission

gears<00:03:01.760> aren't<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.920> best<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.340> my<00:03:04.489> opinion

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.440 

shocks<00:03:07.970> are<00:03:08.150> very<00:03:08.329> basic<00:03:08.569> everything's<00:03:09.319> very

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
shocks are very basic everything's very

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.180 
shocks are very basic everything's very
it's<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.569> an<00:03:11.780> erector<00:03:12.410> set<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.010> less

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
it's like an erector set more or less

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.449 
it's like an erector set more or less
with<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> radio<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.480> motor<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.440> think<00:03:15.950> but

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
with a radio and a motor I think but

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:25.820 
with a radio and a motor I think but
it's<00:03:16.609> cool

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:34.250 

and<00:03:26.400> these<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:27.090> come<00:03:27.120> off<00:03:27.720> there<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:33.080> trim<00:03:34.080> to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and these do come off there I trim to

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.140 
and these do come off there I trim to
mind<00:03:34.970> they<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:37.250> come<00:03:38.250> off<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.850> need<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
mind they do come off you just need to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.090 
mind they do come off you just need to
double<00:03:39.450> hand<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.820> then<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.770> kind<00:03:43.770> of<00:03:43.800> slips

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
double hand and then just kind of slips

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:53.680 
double hand and then just kind of slips
right<00:03:44.160> out<00:03:44.310> after<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.850> yep<00:03:46.610> that's<00:03:47.610> it

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
like the transmission gears and stuff

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.650 
like the transmission gears and stuff
and<00:04:10.520> dudes<00:04:11.520> would<00:04:11.640> probably<00:04:11.970> start<00:04:12.180> slapping

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
and dudes would probably start slapping

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.860
