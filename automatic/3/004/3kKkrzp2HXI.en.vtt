00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
left to right right to left you know

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.360 
left to right right to left you know
just<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.960> constant<00:00:43.320> movement<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.219> your

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just to be in constant movement so your

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.150 
just to be in constant movement so your
head<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.030> easy<00:00:45.210> target<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> there's<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
head is not an easy target but there's a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
head is not an easy target but there's a
little<00:00:47.430> problem<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.780> strafing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
little problem with the what strafing

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
little problem with the what strafing
look<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.920> gonna<00:00:50.070> strafe<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.930> guy

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
look I'm gonna strafe and what my guy

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
look I'm gonna strafe and what my guy
keeps<00:00:52.350> moving<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.940> e<00:00:53.969> does<00:00:54.239> an

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
keeps moving like you know e does an

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
keeps moving like you know e does an
extra<00:00:54.690> step<00:00:54.930> after<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> release<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> key<00:00:56.370> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
extra step after you release the key so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
extra step after you release the key so
everyone<00:00:57.210> knows<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> riffles

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
everyone knows that the riffles

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
everyone knows that the riffles
machineguns<00:00:58.800> snipers<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> they're<00:01:00.120> not

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
machineguns snipers and they're not

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
machineguns snipers and they're not
gonna<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> accurate<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> shoot<00:01:01.350> while

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
gonna be accurate if you shoot while

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
gonna be accurate if you shoot while
moving<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.699> well<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> might<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:03.409> it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
moving so well you might think it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
moving so well you might think it's
better<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.580> crouch<00:01:07.010> before<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.070> kills

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
better to just crouch before he kills

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
better to just crouch before he kills
you<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:08.909> no<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> way

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you right well no because there's a way

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
you right well no because there's a way
to<00:01:10.110> counter<00:01:10.650> these<00:01:10.860> extra<00:01:11.250> steps<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.760> called

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to counter these extra steps it's called

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
to counter these extra steps it's called
counter<00:01:12.630> steps<00:01:12.950> when<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.070> moving

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
counter steps when you're moving

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.749 
counter steps when you're moving
strafing<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:15.259> gently<00:01:16.340> gently<00:01:17.340> tap<00:01:17.729> the

strafing left gently gently tap the
right<00:01:18.409> direction<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.460> gonna<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.299> gonna

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right direction and it's gonna is gonna

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
right direction and it's gonna is gonna
cancel<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.890> extra<00:01:23.189> step<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.670> here's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
cancel the the extra step look here's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
cancel the the extra step look here's
without<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> counter<00:01:25.049> step<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.560> keep<00:01:26.369> moving

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
without the counter step I keep moving

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
without the counter step I keep moving
just<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.299> every<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:27.930> here's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
just a little bit every time well here's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
just a little bit every time well here's
Whitney<00:01:28.829> counter<00:01:29.130> step<00:01:31.729> alright<00:01:32.869> let's<00:01:33.869> start

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Whitney counter step alright let's start

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
Whitney counter step alright let's start
on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.560> show<00:01:35.430> impacts<00:01:39.680> alright<00:01:40.680> let's<00:01:41.340> do

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
on the show impacts alright let's do

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.480 
on the show impacts alright let's do
this<00:01:41.729> I'm<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.210> show<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> difference

this I'm gonna show you the difference

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.990 
this I'm gonna show you the difference
with<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:45.060> counter<00:01:45.360> steps

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.280 

you<00:01:53.000> see<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.240> shots<00:01:53.479> are<00:01:53.630> not<00:01:53.780> accurate<00:01:54.170> at

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you see the shots are not accurate at

all here with the counters right you see
it's<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.549> hundred<00:02:02.210> percent<00:02:02.690> accurate<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.470> it's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
it's a hundred percent accurate and it's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.219
