00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
all right so let's have a little bit

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140 
all right so let's have a little bit
more<00:00:14.990> fun<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:15.440> some<00:00:15.650> snowballs<00:00:16.190> that<00:00:16.490> last

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
more fun with some snowballs that last

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.420 
more fun with some snowballs that last
time<00:00:17.360> I<00:00:17.480> did<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.690> snowball<00:00:18.080> one<00:00:18.260> we<00:00:18.470> made<00:00:18.680> the

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
time I did a snowball one we made the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.310 
time I did a snowball one we made the
blocks<00:00:19.670> where<00:00:20.000> we<00:00:20.420> made<00:00:20.599> two<00:00:20.840> color<00:00:21.050> blocks

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
blocks where we made two color blocks

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.160 
blocks where we made two color blocks
with<00:00:22.070> opposite<00:00:22.700> colors<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.330> their<00:00:23.540> corners<00:00:23.960> so

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
with opposite colors on their corners so

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.600 
with opposite colors on their corners so
the<00:00:24.320> snowball<00:00:24.680> block<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:25.189> one<00:00:25.340> with<00:00:25.520> the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
the snowball block is this one with the

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.400 
the snowball block is this one with the
corners<00:00:25.970> on<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:26.720> we<00:00:26.840> did<00:00:26.990> yellow<00:00:27.140> with<00:00:27.380> green

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
corners on so we did yellow with green

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.050 
corners on so we did yellow with green
squares<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.369> did<00:00:28.520> green<00:00:28.730> with<00:00:28.939> yellow

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
squares and I did green with yellow

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.710 
squares and I did green with yellow
squares<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:30.020> if<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:30.680> remember<00:00:30.890> we<00:00:31.160> made<00:00:31.340> this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
squares and if you remember we made this

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.750 
squares and if you remember we made this
little<00:00:32.720> crop<00:00:32.930> top<00:00:32.960> with<00:00:33.440> sneaky<00:00:34.310> little<00:00:34.520> owls

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
little crop top with sneaky little owls

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.680 
little crop top with sneaky little owls
on<00:00:35.360> it

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
on it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.290 
on it
so<00:00:36.110> that<00:00:36.260> was<00:00:36.380> just<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.649> in<00:00:36.800> two<00:00:37.160> colors<00:00:37.550> more

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
so that was just the in two colors more

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.240 
so that was just the in two colors more
than<00:00:38.480> two<00:00:38.660> fabrics<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:39.320> just<00:00:39.500> in<00:00:39.680> two<00:00:39.860> colors

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
than two fabrics but just in two colors

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.040 
than two fabrics but just in two colors
so<00:00:40.970> today<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.270> thought<00:00:41.390> we'd<00:00:41.690> have<00:00:41.720> another

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
so today I thought we'd have another

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.349 
so today I thought we'd have another
look<00:00:42.170> at<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.410> snowball<00:00:42.860> then<00:00:43.460> again<00:00:43.820> just<00:00:43.850> the

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
look at a snowball then again just the

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.270 
look at a snowball then again just the
snowball<00:00:44.780> block<00:00:44.960> repeat<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.100> had<00:00:46.250> a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
snowball block repeat it but had a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.729 
snowball block repeat it but had a
little<00:00:46.429> play<00:00:46.730> with<00:00:46.940> some<00:00:47.210> color<00:00:47.530> so<00:00:48.530> that

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
little play with some color so that

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.650 
little play with some color so that
we're<00:00:49.160> putting<00:00:49.309> different<00:00:49.579> colors<00:00:50.059> onto<00:00:50.359> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
we're putting different colors onto the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.360 
we're putting different colors onto the
one<00:00:50.839> color<00:00:51.199> background<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:51.859> all<00:00:51.980> my<00:00:52.100> blocks

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
one color background so all my blocks

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.340 
one color background so all my blocks
will<00:00:52.609> be<00:00:52.760> white<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:53.839> I'm<00:00:53.929> going<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.170> put

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
will be white but I'm going to put

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.130 
will be white but I'm going to put
different<00:00:54.469> colors<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.969> corners<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.749> so

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
different colors in the corners and so

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.709 
different colors in the corners and so
I've<00:00:57.260> actually<00:00:57.410> chosen<00:00:57.739> again<00:00:58.370> not<00:00:58.789> just<00:00:59.030> for

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
I've actually chosen again not just for

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.310 
I've actually chosen again not just for
fabrics<00:01:00.499> but<00:01:01.160> several<00:01:01.789> blues<00:01:02.109> several<00:01:03.109> sort

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
fabrics but several blues several sort

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
of ready colors several greens and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
of ready colors several greens and
several<00:01:05.810> yellowy<00:01:06.140> orange<00:01:06.409> colors<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.909> I'll

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
show you shortly and how I've done that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.310 
show you shortly and how I've done that
so<00:01:11.000> I'll<00:01:11.270> just<00:01:11.420> quickly<00:01:11.570> go<00:01:11.870> through<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
so I'll just quickly go through the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.950 
so I'll just quickly go through the
block<00:01:12.860> again<00:01:13.190> now<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.970> did<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.390> block<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.720> video

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
block again now I did the block in video

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.380 
block again now I did the block in video
number<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:15.770> three<00:01:16.159> quilting<00:01:17.000> tips<00:01:17.210> and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
number one for three quilting tips and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.749 
number one for three quilting tips and
techniques<00:01:17.509> one<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.229> three<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:19.670> I'll

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
techniques one for three but I'll

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.190 
techniques one for three but I'll
quickly<00:01:19.970> run<00:01:20.270> through<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:20.570> again

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
quickly run through it again

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.990 
quickly run through it again
the<00:01:21.530> square<00:01:21.829> is<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.009> put<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.340> corners<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the square is to put the corners on so

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.340 
the square is to put the corners on so
initially<00:01:23.450> I've<00:01:23.570> got<00:01:23.720> my<00:01:23.869> six<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.320> half

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
initially I've got my six and a half

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.760 
initially I've got my six and a half
inch<00:01:24.710> square<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.960> some<00:01:26.960> two<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.320> half<00:01:27.530> inch

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
inch square and some two and a half inch

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.160 
inch square and some two and a half inch
squares<00:01:28.130> both<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> colors<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.689> I've

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
squares both of the colors and I've

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.080 
squares both of the colors and I've
drawn<00:01:30.799> my<00:01:30.829> lines<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.399> I<00:01:31.490> show<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.759> all<00:01:31.939> this

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
drawn my lines and I show you all this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.990 
drawn my lines and I show you all this
in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.360> other<00:01:32.450> video<00:01:32.659> in<00:01:33.020> number<00:01:33.409> 143<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.880> I've

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
in the other video in number 143 so I've

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.330 
in the other video in number 143 so I've
drawn<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.360> my<00:01:35.390> lines<00:01:35.719> using<00:01:36.409> my<00:01:36.619> mechanical

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
drawn in my lines using my mechanical

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
drawn in my lines using my mechanical
pencil<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.659> I've<00:01:38.869> got<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.049> line<00:01:39.259> then

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
pencil so that I've got a line then

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.899 
pencil so that I've got a line then
right<00:01:39.649> through<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.950> diagonal<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:40.579> then<00:01:40.729> have

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
right through the diagonal and then have

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.789 
right through the diagonal and then have
a<00:01:40.939> line<00:01:41.149> half<00:01:41.479> an<00:01:41.630> inch<00:01:41.780> away<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.409> this

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
a line half an inch away so that this

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.859 
a line half an inch away so that this
corner<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.280> gets<00:01:43.549> cut<00:01:43.789> off<00:01:43.969> doesn't<00:01:44.750> get

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
corner that gets cut off doesn't get

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.620 
corner that gets cut off doesn't get
wasted<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.409> it'll<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.710> usable<00:01:46.329> so<00:01:47.329> I'll

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
wasted and it'll be usable so I'll

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.300 
wasted and it'll be usable so I'll
quickly<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.530> make<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.920> block<00:01:49.159> up<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.740> when

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
quickly just make this block up and when

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.740 
quickly just make this block up and when
you<00:01:52.399> when<00:01:52.700> you're<00:01:52.820> doing<00:01:53.090> these<00:01:53.210> blocks<00:01:53.509> often

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
you when you're doing these blocks often

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.290 

squares<00:02:55.010> hopefully<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> same<00:02:55.970> color

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300

squares hopefully in the same color
order<00:02:56.599> going<00:02:56.840> around<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.459> basic<00:02:58.879> block<00:02:58.910> so

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
order going around to the basic block so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
order going around to the basic block so
that<00:02:59.690> that's<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.860> when<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.129> join<00:03:01.760> them

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
that that's so that when we join them

all together I'll show you that shortly
that<00:03:04.250> they'll<00:03:04.670> all<00:03:04.819> kind<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.450> sit<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.870> you

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
that they'll all kind of sit so that you

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.420 
that they'll all kind of sit so that you
don't<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.290> two<00:03:06.530> yellows<00:03:06.890> sitting<00:03:07.280> together

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
don't get two yellows sitting together

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.630 
don't get two yellows sitting together
and<00:03:07.849> things<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.799> by<00:03:10.040> using<00:03:10.280> four

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
and things like that so by using four

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.400 
and things like that so by using four
colors

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.110 

because<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.250> call<00:03:16.460> will<00:03:16.670> meet<00:03:16.880> at<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
because the call will meet at the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.850 
because the call will meet at the
corners<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:20.170> normally<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.260> I'm<00:03:21.380> doing<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.710> whole

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
corners so normally if I'm doing a whole

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.950 
corners so normally if I'm doing a whole
group<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> would<00:03:23.540> be<00:03:23.690> trained

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
group of these I would be trained

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.110 
group of these I would be trained
piecing<00:03:24.410> these<00:03:24.590> true

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.820 

it<00:03:28.330> doesn't<00:03:28.660> seem<00:03:28.840> quite<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:29.260> onerous<00:03:29.650> as

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
it doesn't seem quite as onerous as

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.450 
it doesn't seem quite as onerous as
doing<00:03:30.100> them<00:03:30.220> individually<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.820> have<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.210> say<00:03:35.460> my

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
doing them individually I have to say my

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.010 
doing them individually I have to say my
yellow<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.730> exciting<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.360> use<00:03:40.510> these<00:03:40.690> lovely

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
yellow so exciting to use these lovely

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:50.220 
yellow so exciting to use these lovely
colors<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.660> really<00:03:49.810> an<00:03:49.959> exercise

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
these days get these threads out of the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.620 
these days get these threads out of the
way<00:04:38.510> okay<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:39.570> now<00:04:39.930> I've<00:04:40.050> got<00:04:40.169> my<00:04:41.449> block<00:04:42.449> with

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
way okay so now I've got my block with

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.320 
way okay so now I've got my block with
my<00:04:42.830> squares<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:44.130> but<00:04:44.490> I'm<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.760> going<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.090> trim

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
my squares on but I'm just going to trim

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.540 
my squares on but I'm just going to trim
those<00:04:45.510> corners<00:04:46.050> off<00:04:46.260> now<00:04:47.510> like<00:04:48.510> my<00:04:48.690> little<00:04:49.550> bit

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
those corners off now like my little bit

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.969 
those corners off now like my little bit
so<00:04:51.060> I'm<00:04:51.180> laying<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.990> quarter<00:04:52.290> inch<00:04:52.470> line<00:04:52.710> on

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
so I'm laying the quarter inch line on

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.280 
so I'm laying the quarter inch line on
my<00:04:53.310> actual<00:04:53.669> sewing<00:04:53.910> line<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.930> I'm<00:04:55.020> going<00:04:55.169> to

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
my actual sewing line and I'm going to

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.550 
my actual sewing line and I'm going to
cut<00:04:55.470> halfway<00:04:55.710> between<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.900> two<00:04:58.080> lines<00:04:58.290> of

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
cut halfway between the two lines of

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.590 
cut halfway between the two lines of
stitching<00:04:58.800> there<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.460> trim<00:05:00.120> off<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.510> we

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
stitching there and trim off and we

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.300 
stitching there and trim off and we
don't<00:05:00.720> need<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.229> little<00:05:01.740> corner<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.190> we

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
don't need that little corner that we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.610 
don't need that little corner that we
trim<00:05:02.550> away<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.840> because<00:05:03.960> we've<00:05:04.260> done<00:05:04.470> that

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
trim away but because we've done that

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.670 
trim away but because we've done that
line<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.010> sewing<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:06.300> all<00:05:06.540> ready<00:05:06.750> to

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
line of sewing on it it's all ready to

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.640 
line of sewing on it it's all ready to
use<00:05:07.950> as<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:09.270> little<00:05:09.630> half<00:05:09.810> square<00:05:10.139> triangle

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
use as a little half square triangle

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.760 
use as a little half square triangle
square<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:13.050> going<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.290> be<00:05:13.440> something

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
square so it's going to be something

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.000 
square so it's going to be something
happening<00:05:13.950> with<00:05:14.310> those<00:05:14.430> one<00:05:14.700> day<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.770> trim

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
happening with those one day so I trim

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.990 
happening with those one day so I trim
all<00:05:17.160> those<00:05:17.340> off<00:05:19.100> put<00:05:20.100> those<00:05:20.280> in<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.580> safe<00:05:20.820> place

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
all those off put those in a safe place

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.230 
all those off put those in a safe place
to<00:05:21.300> use<00:05:21.479> later<00:05:22.580> I'm<00:05:23.580> going<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.850> just<00:05:24.030> bring<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
to use later I'm going to just bring the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.800 
to use later I'm going to just bring the
iron<00:05:24.510> across<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:27.000> press<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.600> quickly<00:05:27.900> and

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
iron across and press that quickly and

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.560 
iron across and press that quickly and
then<00:05:30.810> I'll<00:05:30.930> show<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:32.150> how<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.270> all<00:05:33.360> goes

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
then I'll show you how it all goes

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.800 
then I'll show you how it all goes
together<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:34.260> it's<00:05:34.979> no<00:05:35.160> snow<00:05:35.639> balls<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:36.180> nice

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
together so it's no snow balls a nice

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.050 
together so it's no snow balls a nice
fun<00:05:37.380> block<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:38.220> can<00:05:38.400> make<00:05:38.550> snowballs<00:05:38.700> with

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
fun block you can make snowballs with

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.640 
fun block you can make snowballs with
different<00:05:39.419> size<00:05:39.600> corners<00:05:40.080> they<00:05:40.229> don't<00:05:40.410> have

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
different size corners they don't have

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.190 
different size corners they don't have
to<00:05:40.800> be<00:05:40.919> this<00:05:41.070> size<00:05:41.310> I've<00:05:41.639> chosen<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:42.930> size

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
to be this size I've chosen this size

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.440 
to be this size I've chosen this size
because<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:44.280> me<00:05:44.400> it's<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.669> nice<00:05:44.820> easy<00:05:45.120> size

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
because I to me it's a nice easy size

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.170 
because I to me it's a nice easy size
and<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.310> probably<00:05:47.310> will<00:05:47.550> be<00:05:47.610> doing<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.060> with

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
and I probably will be doing it with

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.550 
and I probably will be doing it with
some<00:05:48.389> other<00:05:48.539> blocks<00:05:48.840> because<00:05:49.110> normally<00:05:49.440> the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
some other blocks because normally the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.100 
some other blocks because normally the
snowball<00:05:49.919> block<00:05:50.099> is<00:05:50.280> an<00:05:50.430> alternate<00:05:50.940> block<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
snowball block is an alternate block and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.260 
snowball block is an alternate block and
I<00:05:52.380> might<00:05:52.620> be<00:05:52.700> going<00:05:53.700> to<00:05:53.820> play<00:05:54.030> with<00:05:54.210> some

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
I might be going to play with some

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.700 
I might be going to play with some
alternate<00:05:54.870> blocks<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.229> this<00:05:55.380> time<00:05:55.560> I'm<00:05:55.680> just

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
alternate blocks but this time I'm just

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.480 
alternate blocks but this time I'm just
using<00:05:56.280> just<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:57.150> snowball<00:05:57.599> block<00:05:57.979> repeat<00:05:58.979> it

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.330 

so<00:06:02.490> that's<00:06:02.700> that's<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.510> blob<00:06:03.720> just<00:06:04.710> a<00:06:04.800> plain

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
so that's that's the blob just a plain

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.040 
so that's that's the blob just a plain
white<00:06:05.370> in<00:06:05.789> this<00:06:05.910> case<00:06:06.180> with<00:06:06.479> four<00:06:06.750> different

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
white in this case with four different

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.310 
white in this case with four different
color<00:06:07.200> corners<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:08.490> I've<00:06:08.639> used<00:06:09.320> several

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
color corners so I've used several

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.129 
color corners so I've used several
different<00:06:11.060> greens<00:06:12.060> as<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:12.450> can<00:06:12.630> see<00:06:12.840> this

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
different greens as you can see this

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.290 
different greens as you can see this
green<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.560> different<00:06:13.889> to<00:06:14.010> this<00:06:14.160> screen<00:06:14.460> which

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
green is different to this screen which

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.730 
green is different to this screen which
is<00:06:15.479> probably<00:06:15.870> different<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.289> that<00:06:16.440> green

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
is probably different to that green

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.680 
is probably different to that green
which<00:06:17.610> is<00:06:17.789> probably<00:06:18.150> different<00:06:18.479> to<00:06:18.570> that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
which is probably different to that

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.510 
which is probably different to that
green<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.169> you<00:06:19.410> get<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.860> idea<00:06:20.190> of<00:06:20.280> using

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
green so you get the idea of using

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.450 
green so you get the idea of using
several<00:06:20.940> different<00:06:21.120> colors<00:06:21.690> within<00:06:22.349> a<00:06:22.590> color

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
several different colors within a color

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.750 
several different colors within a color
range<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:25.080> because<00:06:25.740> I've<00:06:25.860> sown<00:06:26.160> mine<00:06:26.400> also

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
range so because I've sown mine also

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.960 
range so because I've sown mine also
that<00:06:27.300> I've<00:06:28.260> got<00:06:28.530> my<00:06:28.680> yellow<00:06:28.710> here<00:06:29.160> option

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
that I've got my yellow here option

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.510 
that I've got my yellow here option
which<00:06:30.120> might<00:06:30.450> go<00:06:30.599> Orange<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.320> then<00:06:32.099> my<00:06:32.220> greens

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
which might go Orange and then my greens

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.790 
which might go Orange and then my greens
and<00:06:32.940> then<00:06:33.060> my<00:06:33.180> Reds<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:33.810> then<00:06:33.960> my<00:06:34.110> blues<00:06:34.380> and

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
and then my Reds and then my blues and

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.330 
and then my Reds and then my blues and
they<00:06:34.890> might<00:06:35.099> go<00:06:35.280> purple

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
they might go purple

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.940 
they might go purple
and<00:06:39.640> and<00:06:40.640> so<00:06:40.850> by<00:06:41.300> putting<00:06:41.630> them<00:06:41.750> around<00:06:42.560> this

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
and and so by putting them around this

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.530 
and and so by putting them around this
way<00:06:43.190> we<00:06:43.370> get<00:06:43.520> all<00:06:43.760> these<00:06:43.910> different<00:06:44.120> colors

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
way we get all these different colors

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.080 
way we get all these different colors
that<00:06:45.470> meet<00:06:45.710> in<00:06:45.740> the<00:06:46.010> middle<00:06:46.130> so<00:06:46.430> you<00:06:46.790> would

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
that meet in the middle so you would

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.450 
that meet in the middle so you would
unless<00:06:47.420> you<00:06:47.600> wanting<00:06:48.050> or<00:06:48.260> your<00:06:48.920> Reds<00:06:49.130> in<00:06:49.400> the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
unless you wanting or your Reds in the

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.360 
unless you wanting or your Reds in the
middle<00:06:49.760> for<00:06:50.090> example<00:06:50.950> which<00:06:51.950> is<00:06:52.130> another

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
middle for example which is another

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.120 
middle for example which is another
option<00:06:52.850> and<00:06:53.320> but<00:06:54.320> you<00:06:54.440> need<00:06:54.590> to<00:06:54.710> plan<00:06:54.920> this<00:06:55.070> a

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
option and but you need to plan this a

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.560 
option and but you need to plan this a
little<00:06:55.430> bit<00:06:55.550> but<00:06:55.730> if<00:06:55.910> you're<00:06:56.060> not<00:06:56.240> wanting<00:06:56.540> to

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
little bit but if you're not wanting to

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.940 
little bit but if you're not wanting to
plan<00:06:56.840> it<00:06:56.960> and<00:06:57.020> you<00:06:57.140> just<00:06:57.320> want<00:06:57.530> them<00:06:57.680> all<00:06:57.800> to<00:06:57.830> be

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
plan it and you just want them all to be

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.400 
plan it and you just want them all to be
different<00:06:58.430> the<00:06:58.760> way<00:06:58.910> I<00:06:58.940> have<00:06:59.450> if<00:06:59.990> you<00:07:00.170> keep

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
different the way I have if you keep

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.190 
different the way I have if you keep
them<00:07:00.650> in<00:07:00.920> that<00:07:00.980> same<00:07:01.700> color<00:07:02.000> order<00:07:02.480> going

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
them in that same color order going

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.250 
them in that same color order going
around<00:07:04.120> when<00:07:05.120> they<00:07:05.270> join<00:07:05.510> up<00:07:05.750> you<00:07:05.930> get<00:07:06.140> the

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
around when they join up you get the

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.920 
around when they join up you get the
four<00:07:06.470> different<00:07:06.680> colors<00:07:07.300> meeting<00:07:08.300> in<00:07:08.540> the

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
four different colors meeting in the

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.220 
four different colors meeting in the
middle<00:07:09.170> which<00:07:09.290> was<00:07:09.470> my<00:07:09.680> intention<00:07:10.070> so<00:07:11.230> that's

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
middle which was my intention so that's

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.380 
middle which was my intention so that's
what<00:07:12.440> I<00:07:12.470> wanted<00:07:12.890> to<00:07:12.950> do<00:07:13.190> when<00:07:13.880> I<00:07:13.970> did<00:07:14.180> mine

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
what I wanted to do when I did mine

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.830 
what I wanted to do when I did mine
green<00:07:15.320> in<00:07:15.500> there<00:07:15.710> so<00:07:16.640> I<00:07:16.670> put<00:07:16.910> a<00:07:17.420> few<00:07:17.660> blocks

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
green in there so I put a few blocks

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.170 
green in there so I put a few blocks
together<00:07:18.230> here<00:07:18.620> so<00:07:19.400> this<00:07:19.520> is<00:07:19.640> a<00:07:19.670> bit<00:07:19.910> of<00:07:20.000> fun

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
together here so this is a bit of fun

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.560 
together here so this is a bit of fun
with<00:07:20.360> snowballs<00:07:20.840> with<00:07:21.200> color<00:07:21.470> and<00:07:22.360> I<00:07:23.360> thought

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570 
with snowballs with color and I thought

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.990 
with snowballs with color and I thought
with<00:07:23.840> it<00:07:23.930> being<00:07:24.140> on<00:07:24.260> the<00:07:24.440> white<00:07:24.850> that<00:07:25.850> was

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
with it being on the white that was

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.820 
with it being on the white that was
quite<00:07:26.210> exciting<00:07:26.780> in<00:07:26.900> itself<00:07:27.230> because<00:07:27.650> I<00:07:27.680> think

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
quite exciting in itself because I think

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.170 
quite exciting in itself because I think
that's<00:07:28.220> going<00:07:28.430> to<00:07:28.490> be<00:07:28.580> a<00:07:28.640> great<00:07:28.910> opportunity

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
that's going to be a great opportunity

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.390 
that's going to be a great opportunity
to<00:07:29.510> have<00:07:30.260> a<00:07:30.290> play<00:07:30.530> with<00:07:30.740> some<00:07:30.980> free<00:07:31.190> motion

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
to have a play with some free motion

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.510 
to have a play with some free motion
