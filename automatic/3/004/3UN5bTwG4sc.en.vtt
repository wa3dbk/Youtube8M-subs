00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
today i'll be doing a little review on

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.340 
today i'll be doing a little review on
the<00:00:04.859> 1.7<00:00:05.850> update<00:00:06.270> most<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:06.990> pretty

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the 1.7 update most of it is pretty

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.830 
the 1.7 update most of it is pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.840> fairly

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
self-explanatory and fairly

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.450 
self-explanatory and fairly
disappointing<00:00:10.530> because<00:00:10.650> i<00:00:10.830> was<00:00:10.950> hoping<00:00:11.400> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
disappointing because i was hoping for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.480 
disappointing because i was hoping for
the<00:00:11.759> adventure<00:00:12.269> update<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.340> take

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the adventure update so if they take

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.670 
the adventure update so if they take
their<00:00:14.700> time<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.599> well<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.289> i<00:00:16.410> guess

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
their time and do well on it i guess

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
their time and do well on it i guess
it's<00:00:16.859> worth<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.369> wait<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.900> really

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
it's worth the wait but I was really

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
it's worth the wait but I was really
expecting<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:21.270> here's<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> have

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
expecting it so but here's what we have

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.480 
expecting it so but here's what we have
this<00:00:22.859> time<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.430> Pistons<00:00:24.359> finally

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
this time we have Pistons finally

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.120 
this time we have Pistons finally
hopefully<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.820> upgrade<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:28.170> Minecraft<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
hopefully the upgrade into Minecraft a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
hopefully the upgrade into Minecraft a
few<00:00:29.340> other<00:00:29.519> mods<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.240> way<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> don't<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
few other mods that way I don't have to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
few other mods that way I don't have to
keep<00:00:31.140> updating<00:00:31.859> every<00:00:32.099> time<00:00:32.309> minecraft<00:00:32.940> gets

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
keep updating every time minecraft gets

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.620 
keep updating every time minecraft gets
updated<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.430> for<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.880> guess<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.180> gotta

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
updated but for now I guess I gotta

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.220 
updated but for now I guess I gotta
stick<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.110> own<00:00:37.140> mods<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.950> that'll<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.399> fine

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
stick to my own mods but that'll be fine

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.340 
stick to my own mods but that'll be fine
here<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.680> piston<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.420> cobblestone

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
here we have piston you have cobblestone

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
here we have piston you have cobblestone
i'm<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> weird<00:00:44.640> texture<00:00:45.030> pack<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
i'm using a weird texture pack so it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.790 
i'm using a weird texture pack so it
might<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.870> hard<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.289> some<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> guys

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
might be hard for you some of you guys

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.549 
might be hard for you some of you guys
to<00:00:47.629> understand<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
to understand that but that's a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
to understand that but that's a
cobblestone<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> block<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
cobblestone there you want a block of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
cobblestone there you want a block of
iron<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> center<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.000> stone<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.360> the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
really doesn't have anything four
pistons<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> moment<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.129> fine

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
pistons at the moment but that's fine

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.090 
pistons at the moment but that's fine
it's<00:01:05.640> still<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> piston<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> still<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:07.100> what

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's still a piston it still works what

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's still a piston it still works what
happens<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.490> drop<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.260> nothing<00:01:10.260> no<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
happens very drop it nothing no the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.660 
happens very drop it nothing no the
invisible<00:01:12.990> piston<00:01:13.439> home<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.520> be

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
invisible piston home and that would be

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
invisible piston home and that would be
kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.090> sweet<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:15.869> implement<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
kind of sweet you could implement that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580 
kind of sweet you could implement that
into<00:01:17.490> quite<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> few<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.229> isn't<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
into quite a few things but this isn't a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
into quite a few things but this isn't a
guide<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.950> pistons<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.060> gonna

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guide on pistons so that's not gonna

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.890 
guide on pistons so that's not gonna
make<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> difference<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.840> there's<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
make a make a difference and there's a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
make a make a difference and there's a
sticky<00:01:25.320> piston<00:01:25.530> which<00:01:26.040> basically<00:01:26.670> allows<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
sticky piston which basically allows you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.679 
sticky piston which basically allows you
to<00:01:27.420> stick<00:01:27.720> stuff<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.329> buy<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to stick stuff to it and buy in the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.230 
to stick stuff to it and buy in the
slime<00:01:31.110> ball<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.729> piston<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
slime ball and piston and you get a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.960 
slime ball and piston and you get a
sticky<00:01:33.600> piston<00:01:37.100> I'm<00:01:38.100> sure<00:01:38.369> there's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.640> sexual

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
sticky piston I'm sure there's a sexual

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.370 
sticky piston I'm sure there's a sexual
innuendo<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.630> somewhere<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
innuendo there somewhere but I just I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.899 
innuendo there somewhere but I just I
just<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.159> about<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
just don't want to think about it and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
just don't want to think about it and
moving<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.439> else<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:47.009> quite<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> few

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
moving on what else there's quite a few

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.389 
moving on what else there's quite a few
things<00:01:47.820> added<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.689> update<00:01:49.189> fences<00:01:50.189> can

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
things added in this update fences can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
things added in this update fences can
now<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.729> stacked<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.140> pretty

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
now be stacked which i think is pretty

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.080 
now be stacked which i think is pretty

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.710 
thing who
do<00:02:05.110> they<00:02:05.260> read<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.560> wrong<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:05.980> pretty<00:02:06.370> sure

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
do they read that wrong and pretty sure

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.680 
do they read that wrong and pretty sure
somewhere<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.050> can<00:02:08.680> add<00:02:08.920> lights<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:10.030> fences

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
somewhere you can add lights to fences

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.810 
somewhere you can add lights to fences
but<00:02:10.869> i<00:02:10.899> guess<00:02:11.140> i<00:02:11.410> guess<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.460> might<00:02:12.610> have<00:02:12.790> been

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
but i guess i guess that might have been

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.090 
but i guess i guess that might have been
a<00:02:12.970> myth<00:02:13.270> but<00:02:14.730> double<00:02:15.730> stack<00:02:16.200> fences<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.410> you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
a myth but double stack fences and you

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.350 
a myth but double stack fences and you
can<00:02:18.280> continue<00:02:18.460> on<00:02:18.850> up<00:02:18.880> I'm<00:02:19.240> sure<00:02:19.780> why<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:21.360> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
can continue on up I'm sure why not so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.380 
can continue on up I'm sure why not so
that'll<00:02:22.720> make<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.260> some<00:02:23.560> interesting

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that'll make for some interesting

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.390 
that'll make for some interesting
implementations<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> gate

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
implementations I can see like a gate

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.790 
implementations I can see like a gate
you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.640> use<00:02:27.910> iron<00:02:28.210> doors<00:02:28.600> ear<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.200> fixes<00:02:29.710> all

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
you can use iron doors ear and fixes all

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.710 
you can use iron doors ear and fixes all
around<00:02:30.220> anything<00:02:31.180> anything<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> sort<00:02:33.720> you

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
around anything anything of the sort you

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.390 
around anything anything of the sort you
can<00:02:34.840> use<00:02:35.020> them<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.200> windows<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:35.770> short<00:02:36.190> now

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
can use them for windows and short now

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.840 
can use them for windows and short now
and<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:37.980> think<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.160> way<00:02:39.280> they<00:02:39.459> did<00:02:39.520> that's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and I think the way they did that's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.460 
and I think the way they did that's
pretty<00:02:40.600> sweet<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.510> say<00:02:43.750> naughty

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
pretty sweet so I have to say naughty

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.310 
pretty sweet so I have to say naughty
little<00:02:44.830> behind<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:46.050> other<00:02:47.050> than

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
little behind on that but other than

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.180 
little behind on that but other than
that<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.950> agree<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:50.260> else<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.650> need<00:02:50.920> we

what had killed cheese what am I saying
one<00:03:39.950> hit<00:03:40.189> destroy<00:03:41.079> now<00:03:42.079> they<00:03:42.379> can<00:03:42.530> only<00:03:42.620> be

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
one hit destroy now they can only be

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.140 
one hit destroy now they can only be
detonated<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:43.459> fire<00:03:43.849> and<00:03:44.889> redstone<00:03:45.889> and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.610 

yeah<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.359> goes<00:03:50.569> boom<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:53.079> can't<00:03:54.079> wait<00:03:54.139> till<00:03:54.469> they

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
yeah it goes boom I can't wait till they

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.949 
yeah it goes boom I can't wait till they
change<00:03:55.129> out<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.519> Java<00:03:55.819> format<00:03:56.359> so<00:03:56.629> we<00:03:56.780> can

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
change out of the Java format so we can

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.890 
change out of the Java format so we can
do<00:03:57.560> much<00:03:57.829> better<00:03:57.859> TNT<00:03:58.730> videos<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.510> I'm<00:03:59.629> hoping

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
do much better TNT videos so I'm hoping

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.890 
do much better TNT videos so I'm hoping
that<00:03:59.959> comes<00:04:00.379> one<00:04:00.680> day<00:04:01.239> Java<00:04:02.239> is<00:04:02.389> such<00:04:02.870> a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
that comes one day Java is such a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.990 
that comes one day Java is such a
limiter<00:04:03.379> we're<00:04:03.680> not<00:04:03.919> doing<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:05.500> think

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
limiter we're not doing that so I think

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.610 
limiter we're not doing that so I think
the<00:04:08.000> adventure<00:04:08.510> update<00:04:08.870> hopefully<00:04:09.319> will<00:04:09.439> come

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the adventure update hopefully will come

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.159 
the adventure update hopefully will come
in<00:04:09.739> 1.8<00:04:10.459> which<00:04:10.730> probably<00:04:11.269> won't<00:04:11.689> be<00:04:11.900> anytime

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
in 1.8 which probably won't be anytime

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.999 
in 1.8 which probably won't be anytime
soon<00:04:12.379> I'm<00:04:13.370> guessing<00:04:13.819> a<00:04:13.909> month<00:04:14.560> hopefully<00:04:15.560> a

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
soon I'm guessing a month hopefully a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.409 
soon I'm guessing a month hopefully a
month<00:04:16.340> not<00:04:17.120> even<00:04:17.239> longer<00:04:18.579> so<00:04:19.579> once<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.269> one

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
month not even longer so once the one

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.379 
month not even longer so once the one

maps hopefully until then I just get a

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.810 
maps hopefully until then I just get a
