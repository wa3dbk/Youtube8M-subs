00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.070
 a lifeless faction 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.070
 on the run 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.929

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.760
 what a fart pinches roleros today because 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.860
 you will have already seen in the title of the video 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
 I'll show you the little curiosities 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.350
 known about this saga that I love so much 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 what is gta well let's start ok well we 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.020
 let's go to gta 4 remember the assumption 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.840
 someone on the map of gta 4 in milk the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.910
 park because that supposed someone is nothing 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 more and nothing less than a failed artwork 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.940
 from patrick mccray aja pinche text a lo 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.270
 who does not pronounce good English well and 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.620
 here the final artwork of patrick 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 let's compare the map's patrick with the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.700
 patrick of reality 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.120
 well seeing it like this the nose and the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.350
 head have a big resemblance okay 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.320
 We are sticking with the gta 4 89% 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.990
 gta 4 players believed that gta 5 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.540
 would be in vice city of course yes 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.600
 I also thought about it because there are several 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.640
 winks like the radio station 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 city ​​in the fence gay tony and the lost 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.610
 and damned vice city is mentioned 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.340
 many times in gta 4 before doing the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 Last mission in the gta 4 original roman 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.650
 private jet to vice city ​​in a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.800
 mission on a dock say the drug 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.300
 is trafficked device city to liberty city 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.280
 Roman tells us that he wants to go to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.220
 airport with your taxi to pick up 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.830
 people who come from vice city ​​but in 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.830

 x from another vice city as you already know 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.660
 the mansion of tommy vercetti looks like 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.640

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.350
 part of the stairs and the source that 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.390
 says the world is yours then in the mansion 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.810

 tommy lawyer called who rosenberg 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.989
 It has an extreme resemblance to 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.900
 lawyer who leaves in scarface to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.329
 pacino in the movie carlitos white o 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.299
 in Spanish trapped by his past x 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.969
 nothing to do with the title in English 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.670
 but if it looks a lot like that, let's see another 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.439
 curiosity that I could notice in 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.409

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.169
 helicopter in the upper corner 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.080
 let's see 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:28.289
 gta 3 gta vice city gta san andreas 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.699
 gta liberty city stories gta vice city

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.590
 helicopter x in addition that in both 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.419

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.419

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.010
 yellow car and in the 2 liberty cities 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.250
 a woman comes out on top 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.130
 right and the both leaves a red car and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.979
 the san andreas is unique hehehe another 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.229
 curiosity in the gta chinatown wars is 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.360
 possible to hear the voice of huang and the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.270
 main character that like everyone in the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.150
 game talks by written dialogues what 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.909
 The only thing they have to do is grab a 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.030
 car then throw it into the sea and 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.020
 they stay but without breaking the glass 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.780
 then lead field 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.840
 that in Spanish is shit another curiosity 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.639
 is that if there was a section in the 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.819
 guinness record book of the video game 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.979
 with more self advertising would win gta without 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.720
 doubt some good then to conclude 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.750
 the video let's go to the last curiosity 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.509
 and one of my favorites hehe all 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.669
 remember the sound of power if you already 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.360
 they know that sound of gta 3 when you 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.360
 they sent a message 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.210
 Well, that sound appears in two 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:51.740
 more deliveries in the gta vice city ​​is the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.740
 rockstar north intro sound 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.460
 and finally in gta 4 it appears as tone 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.460
 ring for the cell phone 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.000
 Well, that sound is nothing more and nothing 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.240
 less than the song of gta 1 let's listen 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240
 the 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.110
 well now let's all listen together for 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.110
