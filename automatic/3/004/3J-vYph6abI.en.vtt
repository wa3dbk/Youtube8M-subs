when<00:00:13.280> we<00:00:13.400> started<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:13.849> 918<00:00:14.419> spyder<00:00:14.870> project

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.090 

we<00:00:18.440> decided<00:00:18.950> we<00:00:19.220> will<00:00:19.610> try<00:00:19.940> to<00:00:19.970> keep<00:00:20.360> it<00:00:20.510> secret

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
we decided we will try to keep it secret

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.290 
we decided we will try to keep it secret
it<00:00:24.100> is<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:25.500> vision<00:00:26.500> for<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.039> future<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.730> the

it is a vision for the future of the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.610 
it is a vision for the future of the
brand

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620 
brand

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.609 
brand
the<00:00:30.130> importance<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:31.030> car<00:00:31.360> was<00:00:31.840> that<00:00:32.290> due

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
the importance of this car was that due

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.240 
the importance of this car was that due
to<00:00:32.830> the<00:00:32.980> environmental<00:00:33.580> discussion<00:00:35.250> there

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
to the environmental discussion there

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.240 
to the environmental discussion there
were<00:00:36.400> big<00:00:37.090> big<00:00:37.360> question<00:00:37.570> marks<00:00:38.380> about<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
were big big question marks about the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.870 
were big big question marks about the
future<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:40.090> this<00:00:40.450> type<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.840> cars

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:01:01.080 

the<00:00:45.060> future<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> Porsche<00:00:46.050> brand

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.150 

so<00:01:01.780> therefore<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:02.380> wanted<00:01:02.740> to<00:01:02.860> have<00:01:03.010> this

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
so therefore we wanted to have this

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:29.960 
so therefore we wanted to have this
symbol<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.820> there<00:01:04.480> is<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:04.630> future

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.730 

we<00:01:30.970> are<00:01:31.090> using<00:01:31.300> a<00:01:31.570> technology<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.530> is

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
we are using a technology that is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.470 
we are using a technology that is
pointing<00:01:33.190> out<00:01:33.310> what<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.820> could<00:01:34.060> be<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
pointing out what it could be in the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.020 
pointing out what it could be in the
future<00:01:34.900> but<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.350> still<00:01:35.620> realistic<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.910> it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
future but is still realistic to have it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.590 
future but is still realistic to have it
already<00:01:37.240> today<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.620> car<00:01:44.880> we've<00:01:45.880> tested<00:01:46.240> in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
already today in the car we've tested in

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.020 
already today in the car we've tested in
the<00:01:46.720> race<00:01:46.930> among<00:01:47.440> you're<00:01:47.830> sure<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.580> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
the race among you're sure that is the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.480 
the race among you're sure that is the
right<00:01:49.210> technology<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.290> right<00:01:50.490> combination

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
right technology the right combination

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.050 
right technology the right combination
of<00:01:51.610> components

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
of components

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.420 
of components
let<00:01:53.480> me<00:01:53.630> go<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.050> next

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.179 

the<00:01:59.430> most<00:01:59.640> important<00:02:00.210> message<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.189> there

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the most important message is that there

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
the most important message is that there
is<00:02:02.399> no<00:02:02.640> contradiction<00:02:03.090> anymore<00:02:03.840> between

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is no contradiction anymore between

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.219 
is no contradiction anymore between
performance<00:02:05.009> between<00:02:05.670> having<00:02:06.270> fun<00:02:06.539> driving<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
performance between having fun driving a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
performance between having fun driving a
car<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.340> whole<00:02:08.580> environmental

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
car and this whole environmental

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.720 
car and this whole environmental
discussion

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.059 

it<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:17.540> combining<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.319> best<00:02:18.530> crop<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
it is really combining the best crop of

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.980 
it is really combining the best crop of
