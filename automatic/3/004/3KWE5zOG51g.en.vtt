00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.839
 I think the internet will be another season at FCK 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.039
 who settled in already 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.839
 drive yes 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.149
 Of course, percent on young people if you look good 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.499
 can integrate 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.169
 not any longer longer 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.089
 the race was over 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.409
 to object and when with couples has players 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.119
 and by 9 4 percent 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.660
 Super integrated 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.390
 Super recorded and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 it was easy for me 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 would you say that it was the right decision I had for the FCK 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 decide 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.310
 April among other things I regret nothing and info services then that's not only 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.280
 from the network 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.090
 when another year then out 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 Of course, too 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.110
 this is a year played Bundesliga 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 where would you say my progress 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 won the biggest 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.670
 I have my game, the collected water does not match that of the player 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.960
 and you just have to follow with the lives 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.290
 the audience and then again that draws the most important 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.390
 can you imagine 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 m about this should end up 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.500
 Examples 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 also to stay or play at the FCK 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 So corporate security I do not object 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 but must have a look yes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.760
 what was employer man 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.910
 the TuS after their own spoes after two games now have a point 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.320
 you can already feel a bit of pressure there 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.150
 I do not want to say more because they had passed away to his 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.430
 Annual convention in his state 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.770
 but if you want to see the covenant now too, canned lots of favorites too 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.730
 not started well and percent stemmte now Ursula auction 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.150
 we can build up on it and hurt suddenly too late 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.950
 where do you see exactly in the team yet 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 in the offensive area Adele Axel Kammerer Leek 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.020
 in all areas 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 If you want to generally improve you should always provide in the 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.640
 Finding process now in the beginning 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.790
 and I think it's gonna be game-by-game too 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.960
 how do you rate the new entries
