00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
so let's take a look at what we've got

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.000 
so let's take a look at what we've got
let's<00:04:25.430> find<00:04:25.820> out<00:04:27.310> well<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.840> two<00:04:29.840> stacks<00:04:30.590> of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
let's find out well it's two stacks of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.920 
let's find out well it's two stacks of
frostweave<00:04:31.970> clothe<00:04:33.670> couple<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.790> greens<00:04:35.390> I
