00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello to all viewers of my channel 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.269
 and today's topic of our video tutorial 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.300
 these are harnesses 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.040
 tow and this is such a very common 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
 hairstyle item 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 simple enough for those who can't 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 weave spikelets 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.840
 harnesses are a great alternative 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.660
 zhku you are very widely exploited 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.500
 It is in children's hairstyles under the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.239
 the reason that using hair harnesses 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 you can perfectly remove the various 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.640
 short shaft bipod on the edge line 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 hair growth bratchuk u if 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.340
 necessary and very popular and harnesses 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.750
 especially in summer as 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 allow you to remove hair from the face and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.050
 It looks at this beautifully today I will 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 I will show several options as possible 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 make a harness 3 and generally technique 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 performing this item hairstyles and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 so today I'll shoot from the top to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.510
 you knew better 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 in order to make harnesses to you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.299
 need a comb with a thin tail and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 also invisible 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.970
 for starters you must divide your head by 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.170
 two parts of the front for not so harness and we 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 weave 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 exactly to the middle of the head that is the tone 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.640
 highest point head hair back 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.159
 parts better to stab so they 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.580
 we did not interfere, and so the most simple harnesses 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.130
 separated from growth by direct parting 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.460
 so we separated about the parting with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.540
 one side so that the hair does not bother us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.200
 we will stab them and select Clip 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.720
 This is the groove hair we delay and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.330
 check how even we parted 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.470
 other hair also we pin 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.709
 barrette for your own convenience and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.739
 so how do weave hair braid 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.190
 You can pre-process 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.120
 hairspray but preferably not much 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:32.239
 and so starting from the very edge line 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.769
 hair growth we start to wrap 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.769
 our hair 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.380
 tow 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.420
 that is, this is how you can 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.130
 then do not harness the volume 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.140
 begin to wrap the edge of a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:02.980
 just flip hide and end with a harness 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:06.920
 we fix invisible and in the same way 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.330
 continue to separate the hair strand 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:18.130
 We look that they on width were 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:21.880
 the same and start turning 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.940
 fix invisible in the same way 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.640
 continue on this is the easiest 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.110
 scheme that is even partings when we 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 we separate wasps 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.670
 when you wrap the cistern appreciate them 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.860
 cell important hair 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.160
 the temporal zone is a must 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.100
 spin up in order for 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.500
 to our hairstyle our harness and more than once 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.560
 tried as a rule when they are twisted 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.450
 down that is so we 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.450
 we twist to the top 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.700
 and so down the hairstyle will be 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.959
 stay longer in case you 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.770
 will spin 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.670
 harnesses on top and go to the other 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.550
 to the side 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.890
 if these harnesses we twisted in 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.049
 direction up then harness and second 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.739
 half of the head we can spin 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.190
 towards them that is the same direction 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.070
 up and so the first option we have is ready 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.540
 half of the hairstyle itself is ready 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:36.620
 from the hairs behind we can make a shell 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.310
 either braid the spike here is so beautiful 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.440
 element 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.400
 I 'll show you some more 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.250
 options as you can braid the harnesses and so 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.160
 the next option with the scheme by which 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.390
 braids can be braided 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:57.080
 I call this option the sun 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 when we schedule a slave can be on the side 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.800
 maybe in the middle and from him 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 triangles 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.410
 we also allocate the partings that is 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.390
 breakdown we go all from one point then 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.390
 there is the first harness 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.390
 2 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.220
 here as you see I chose 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.220
 Asymmetrical that is, from the side of the parting 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.690
 third again the further we go down 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.200
 the more we pull to the middle and the last 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.200
 tow 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.930
 carcass you are located as if on 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.830
 side and also braid the second part 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.500
 heads are separated by triangles but in this 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.169
 if we are here 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.099
 spun to part 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:09.870
 main side then this side we are so 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:13.919
 same spin to the parting again whiskey 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:18.629
 we twist up and so that's what we have in 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:23.490
 it turned out how you see the breakdown 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:26.479
 diverge like the sun that is from 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.479
 single point 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:36.800
 the next option is when we harnesses 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:39.659
 we will separate the zigzag parting 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.669
 that is, the first harness we will have 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:48.270
 outlined in the middle again, select 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:51.439
 first triangle here we have it 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.719
 it turns out in the middle 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:58.199
 according to this scheme, the harness and get more 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:01.770
 voluminous second triangle we will have 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:11.309
 respectively top back but 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:15.139
 we twist and IMHO also to the back and so 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:22.129
 that's what we ended up with from 3 2 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:22.129
 option harnesses we pinned off 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.149
 dear zigzag 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:34.210
 another very popular method 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:40.860
 tourniquet use it 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:44.710
 something hairstyles on one side when 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:50.229
 bundles fit only one side 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:55.659
 and also in hairstyles 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:59.069
 erokez this way you can put one and 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:59.069
 the other side 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.840
 all I have for today's topic was for you 

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.170
 is useful 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.510
 I wish you all success and to 

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.510
 new interesting videos yet
