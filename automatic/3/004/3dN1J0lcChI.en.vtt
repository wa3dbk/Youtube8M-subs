00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the other day which hopefully match this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.870 
the other day which hopefully match this
um<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.900> what<00:02:41.049> color<00:02:41.230> they<00:02:41.470> are<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.790> like

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
um this is what color they are it's like

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.240 
um this is what color they are it's like
a<00:02:42.970> really<00:02:43.239> nice<00:02:43.510> natural<00:02:43.870> brown<00:02:44.769> color<00:02:45.010> which

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
a really nice natural brown color which

a really nice natural brown color which
is<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:45.549> hair<00:02:45.760> color<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.440> hopefully<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.730> all

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
is my hair color and so hopefully it all

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.900 
is my hair color and so hopefully it all
turns<00:02:49.660> out<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.989> color<00:02:50.200> um<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:51.819> you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
turns out this color um you know you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.720 
turns out this color um you know you
can't<00:02:52.299> really<00:02:52.980> predict<00:02:53.980> anything<00:02:54.430> especially

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
can't really predict anything especially

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.130 
can't really predict anything especially
when<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.269> red<00:02:55.450> hair<00:02:55.480> because<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.049> know

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
when you have red hair because you know

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.380 
when you have red hair because you know
the<00:02:56.440> red<00:02:56.620> shows<00:02:57.130> really<00:02:57.580> easily<00:02:58.000> through<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
the red shows really easily through the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.750 
the red shows really easily through the
hair<00:02:58.810> dye<00:02:59.069> especially<00:03:00.069> if<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.549> really

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
hair dye especially if it's a really

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.580 
hair dye especially if it's a really
dark<00:03:00.970> ranking<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.720> hopefully<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.440> is

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
dark ranking like that hopefully this is

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.349 
dark ranking like that hopefully this is
laying<00:03:02.799> enough<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.459> we'll<00:03:03.820> get<00:03:04.000> light<00:03:04.150> enough

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
laying enough or we'll get light enough

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.780 
laying enough or we'll get light enough
after<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.720> colors<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.380> yeah<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.519> kind

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
after the colors and yeah so it's kind

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.870 
after the colors and yeah so it's kind
of<00:03:06.850> like<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.930> pretty<00:03:08.049> close

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of like it's pretty close

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.470 
of like it's pretty close
so<00:03:09.880> hopefully<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:11.190> turns<00:03:12.190> out<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:12.670> right

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
so hopefully that turns out all right

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.569 
so hopefully that turns out all right
usually<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.109> usually<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:14.859> do<00:03:14.950> pretty<00:03:15.160> good<00:03:15.340> with

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
before I die it just so you can get a

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.240 
before I die it just so you can get a
sense<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.540> how<00:04:37.600> much<00:04:37.720> red<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.110> really<00:04:38.260> in<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.650> um

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
sense of how much red is really in it um

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.640 
sense of how much red is really in it um
it's<00:04:39.700> mostly<00:04:40.090> like<00:04:40.300> light<00:04:40.600> pinky<00:04:41.230> orange

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
it's mostly like light pinky orange

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.270 
it's mostly like light pinky orange
color<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.160> here<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.390> then<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:44.260> use<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.100> color

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
color up here and then I use the color

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.070 
color up here and then I use the color
up<00:04:45.490> stone<00:04:45.700> here<00:04:45.970> which<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.450> kind<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.750> turned<00:04:46.990> it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
up stone here which is kind of turned it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.120 
up stone here which is kind of turned it
like<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> light<00:04:47.500> brown<00:04:47.770> splash<00:04:48.510> pinky<00:04:49.510> orange

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
like a light brown splash pinky orange

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.300 
like a light brown splash pinky orange
so<00:04:51.130> overall<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.650> think<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.770> gonna<00:04:53.919> go<00:04:54.100> really

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
so overall I think it's gonna go really

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.760 
so overall I think it's gonna go really
well<00:04:54.430> cuz<00:04:54.850> there's<00:04:55.030> no<00:04:55.090> actual<00:04:55.660> really<00:04:56.230> red<00:04:56.530> in

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
well cuz there's no actual really red in

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.170 
well cuz there's no actual really red in
it<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:58.120> kind<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:58.660> like<00:04:58.780> tones<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.710> it

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
it it's kind of just like tones of it

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.630 
it it's kind of just like tones of it
it's<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.390> of<00:05:01.510> warm<00:05:01.750> like<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:01.990> blonde<00:05:02.640> with
