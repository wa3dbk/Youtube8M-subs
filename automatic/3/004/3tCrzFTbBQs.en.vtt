00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.370 
four-point-oh or something so ja it
dropped<00:04:35.790> like<00:04:35.940> halfway<00:04:36.180> but<00:04:37.050> I'm<00:04:37.170> definitely

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
dropped like halfway but I'm definitely

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.200 
dropped like halfway but I'm definitely
having<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.950> lot<00:04:38.130> more<00:04:38.160> fun<00:04:38.550> playing<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.000> game

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
having a lot more fun playing the game

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.700 
having a lot more fun playing the game
and<00:04:39.540> I<00:04:39.930> think<00:04:40.110> that's<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.290> way<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.530> going

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
and I think that's the way of going

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.140 
and I think that's the way of going
about<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.340> don't<00:04:41.640> take<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.030> too

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
about it like don't take it too

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.730 
about it like don't take it too
seriously<00:04:42.570> because<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.350> game<00:04:43.560> and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
seriously because it is just a game and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.130 
seriously because it is just a game and
it<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.100> have<00:04:44.280> fun<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.900> that's<00:04:45.900> definitely

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
it is to have fun and that's definitely

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.870 
it is to have fun and that's definitely
