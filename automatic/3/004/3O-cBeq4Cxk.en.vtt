the<00:01:47.920> first<00:01:48.070> 12<00:01:48.370> years<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.640> my<00:01:48.760> life<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:49.090> thought

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
the first 12 years of my life I thought

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.690 
the first 12 years of my life I thought
was<00:01:49.420> Hispanic<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.110> was<00:01:50.230> pretty<00:01:50.410> sure<00:01:50.620> but<00:01:51.610> they

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
was Hispanic I was pretty sure but they

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.070 
was Hispanic I was pretty sure but they
reminded<00:01:52.090> me<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.360> was<00:01:52.480> white<00:01:52.660> quite<00:01:52.900> often

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
reminded me that I was white quite often

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.010 
reminded me that I was white quite often
and<00:01:53.730> so<00:01:54.730> yeah<00:01:54.940> I<00:01:54.970> was<00:01:55.150> just<00:01:55.270> necessity<00:01:55.780> based

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
and so yeah I was just necessity based

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.840 
and so yeah I was just necessity based
and<00:01:56.290> that's<00:01:57.070> where<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> think<00:01:58.170> even<00:01:59.170> MMA<00:01:59.920> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
and that's where I think even MMA the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.570 
and that's where I think even MMA the
journey<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.300> kind<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.630> started<00:02:01.810> from<00:02:01.990> there

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
journey all kind of started from there

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.670 
journey all kind of started from there
was<00:02:03.580> just<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.880> need<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.090> like<00:02:04.500> there's<00:02:05.500> got
