00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.050
 ugly now 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.750
 the sims 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.450
 mail first 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.269
 or not 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.689
 the name of the author the mention of the author's name the recognition of the 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.029
 moral right 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.380
 the credits 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.270
 katy &amp; law 600 33 barra curantur and subsequent modifications that you put into 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.589
 this condition 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.070
 because it is dear law 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.980
 you foresee that if the photo is creative and is a work of genius, there is a 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.620
 obligation size of the author's name 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.360
 because that is the moral right belongs to the moral right of the author 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 or 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.000
 if photography is a simple photograph a simple photograph does not 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 creative 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 since it is an accessory right and not a work of genius 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.710
 the obligation to the mind the name of the author is not there because the work 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 since it is not a work that is a simple photograph. and does not exist 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 moral right connected to these simple photographs 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.480
 this means that 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 to know if the obligation exists the mention of the author must first 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.240
 decide if the photo of the flower creative photo but how we said that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.450
 often it is not easy to do it 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.550
 then 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.350
 we know that there is a law that provides for this obligation and is a right 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.850
 inalienable you can't sell you can't sell to others when I have too 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.430
 sold all the exploitation rights of my creative images I gave up 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 just the underpants of these photographs still remain in my hands 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 as an author 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.220
 the right to be mentioned as the author of the images and therefore to see 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.329
 the numbers brought 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
 which, on the other hand, is no excuse for bike thighs photographs photographs 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.000
 Considerable non-creative 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040
 it must be said, however, that the law is the one that describes what happens 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.060
 when you quarrel 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.080
 and when he retires when there is no agreement 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.150
 Unfortunately 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
 in the custom agreements also come 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.920
 considered as such 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.479
 not so much because there is agreement but because it is customary to do so 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.579
 the law of the mixed what it says 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.640
 what you can use to do 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.530
 it is customary to do that when you could say it paid a little it normally opens 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.949
 editorial uses 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.290
 the sop front made that the image is paid little 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:20.329
 contains the author's name quote which is used almost as if it were a 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.320
 sort of payment is not so 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.850
 it would be a right but it is spent as if it were a payment I also put the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.349
 first name 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.189
 conversely, it is always used but that is not what the law says 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.269
 when the image is paid so much for example to me 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.559
 advertising crises 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:41.359
 the name of the author bisio also puts in favor of the advertising agency 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.140
 decrees of the advertising judge 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.730
 that having conceived 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.549
 hotel stolen but still having in hand the co 7 the creativity of the agencies 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.909
 of the countryside 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.169
 the theme prefer cd dvd 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.229
 indicate the name of the photographer to clearly indicate me not the agencies 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.179
 Advertisement 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.479
 walk to the sidelines of the countryside when these forgotten whether in one 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.639
 advertising campaign 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.919
 the name of the potro fa is reported in most cases and why 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.999
 a name has been chosen with a capital m 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.269
 so to say that the photo was made by the great author naming which great 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.179
 author adds a step to the cream 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.769
 advertising is therefore used instrumentally not as a concession 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.130
 what can be done by the author from the outset to come 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.829
 the guaranteed its rights 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.849
 in the first place it is necessary to be specific of the customer because we told each other the law 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.889
 the regulated locke requires regulation now 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.820
 because a regulation required when the agreement is missing 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.890
 if there is an agreement upstream that the photo is creative as well there is nothing to worry about 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.120
 barea agreement 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.759
 therefore ideal whenever possible 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.279
 speak expressly with the customer who will agree to publish their own name 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.659
 nicredit 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.199
 which due by law on the photo and creative due to agreement if you take 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.789
 this agreement also wants non-creative photos 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.549
 and then 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.829
 carrefour always provide images of documentation that helps to put 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.639
 the name 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.249
 break the customer boxes because you remember I'll put that to know the 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.909
 moment in which despite the technical facilitation despite the 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.670
 agreements 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.480
 the customer has committed to indicate this name 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.880
 it is possible to stamp the feet legally when the photograph has 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.570
 a marginal pulse content that can describe how to make fakes 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.279
 creative negotiation 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.499
 and then let's all help each other to get through this culture of the normal year 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.969
 correct attribution of the gods of the photographs 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.250
 although it is true that it is not worth the money that has that it should not be used 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.870
 as payment the mention of the author's name as 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.889
 inalienable right the author is part of the reason we live and do 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.460
 this work for money is a little bit for ourselves for self-respect 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.400
 for the sake of our of our work 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.669
 the number contains 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:56.259
 ok
