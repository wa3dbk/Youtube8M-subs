00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
video everything seems to just work but

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.330 
video everything seems to just work but
actually<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.630> took<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:53.050> lot<00:05:53.230> of<00:05:53.290> takes<00:05:53.830> just

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
actually it took a lot of takes just

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.700 
actually it took a lot of takes just
because<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:55.450> doesn't<00:05:55.930> always<00:05:56.110> work<00:05:56.440> as

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
because it doesn't always work as

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.160 
because it doesn't always work as
expected<00:05:56.920> like<00:05:57.850> here<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.240> Omni<00:05:58.660> I<00:05:58.690> shows<00:05:58.990> the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
expected like here the Omni I shows the

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.650 
expected like here the Omni I shows the
thumbnails<00:05:59.680> where<00:06:00.070> is<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.370> n85<00:06:00.820> dozen<00:06:01.630> and

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
thumbnails where is the n85 dozen and

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.840 
thumbnails where is the n85 dozen and
another<00:06:04.660> problem<00:06:04.900> is<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.650> yo<00:06:06.160> mia<00:06:06.400> has<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.610> bad

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
another problem is that yo mia has a bad

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.450 
another problem is that yo mia has a bad
habit<00:06:07.090> of<00:06:07.480> disconnecting<00:06:08.350> from<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:08.590> DLNA

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
habit of disconnecting from the DLNA

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.240 
habit of disconnecting from the DLNA
server<00:06:10.150> so<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.750> know<00:06:11.260> after<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.650> few<00:06:11.890> minutes

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
server so you know after a few minutes

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.910 
server so you know after a few minutes
it<00:06:12.430> will<00:06:12.520> disconnect<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.570> think<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.740> might

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
it will disconnect I think you might

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.320 
it will disconnect I think you might
have<00:06:15.040> to<00:06:15.190> leave<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:15.520> plugged<00:06:15.790> into<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.210> power

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
have to leave it plugged into the power

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.560 
have to leave it plugged into the power
or<00:06:16.840> something<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.740> n85<00:06:18.130> it<00:06:18.820> does<00:06:19.210> this<00:06:19.330> better

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
or something the n85 it does this better

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.930 
or something the n85 it does this better
job<00:06:19.840> of<00:06:19.870> staying<00:06:20.200> connected<00:06:20.560> but<00:06:21.100> yeah<00:06:21.700> it

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.160 
there are the samsung LED TVs these
really<00:06:32.890> thin<00:06:33.130> ones<00:06:33.430> there's<00:06:34.360> a<00:06:34.450> model<00:06:34.960> without

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
really thin ones there's a model without

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.150 
really thin ones there's a model without
DLNA<00:06:36.100> and<00:06:36.550> it<00:06:36.790> costs<00:06:37.480> a<00:06:37.630> lot<00:06:37.780> less<00:06:37.920> than<00:06:38.920> this

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
DLNA and it costs a lot less than this

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.150 
DLNA and it costs a lot less than this
one<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:40.630> so<00:06:40.870> you<00:06:40.930> actually<00:06:41.260> pay<00:06:41.590> a<00:06:41.620> lot<00:06:41.920> to

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
one and so you actually pay a lot to

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.940 
one and so you actually pay a lot to
have<00:06:42.370> it<00:06:42.520> built<00:06:42.700> in<00:06:43.060> but<00:06:43.900> it's<00:06:44.320> like<00:06:44.620> I<00:06:44.830> of

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
have it built in but it's like I of

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.820 
have it built in but it's like I of
shows<00:06:45.220> it<00:06:45.490> doesn't<00:06:46.030> always<00:06:46.150> work<00:06:46.420> as

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
shows it doesn't always work as

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.700 
shows it doesn't always work as
predicted<00:06:47.830> so<00:06:48.210> it's<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.360> feature<00:06:49.570> that<00:06:50.080> you

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
predicted so it's a feature that you

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.730 
predicted so it's a feature that you
probably<00:06:51.220> want<00:06:51.910> but<00:06:52.240> you<00:06:52.360> also<00:06:52.570> want<00:06:52.750> them<00:06:53.290> to

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
probably want but you also want them to

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.640 
probably want but you also want them to
work<00:06:54.100> out<00:06:54.310> all<00:06:54.460> the<00:06:54.490> kinks<00:06:54.640> first<00:06:55.300> as<00:06:56.260> you<00:06:56.500> can

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
work out all the kinks first as you can

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.040 
work out all the kinks first as you can
see<00:06:56.890> it<00:06:57.010> didn't<00:06:57.310> work<00:06:57.430> very<00:06:57.460> smoothly<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:58.750> I

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
see it didn't work very smoothly so I

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.800 
see it didn't work very smoothly so I
guess<00:06:59.440> it's<00:06:59.560> a<00:06:59.770> work<00:06:59.920> in<00:07:00.100> progress<00:07:00.480> so<00:07:01.480> I'm<00:07:01.630> how

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
guess it's a work in progress so I'm how

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.340 
guess it's a work in progress so I'm how
actually<00:07:01.990> thanks<00:07:02.770> for<00:07:02.920> watching
