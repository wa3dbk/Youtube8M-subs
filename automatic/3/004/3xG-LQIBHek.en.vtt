one<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> problems<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> right<00:01:56.700> into<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
one of the problems you right into is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
one of the problems you right into is
they're<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.630> listed<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> measures<00:01:58.799> are

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
they're not listed what the measures are

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459 
they're not listed what the measures are
they'll<00:01:59.280> say<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.570> jigger<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> half<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> jigger

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
they'll say a jigger and a half a jigger

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.109 
they'll say a jigger and a half a jigger
on<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.860> side<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> other<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.939> very

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
on one side or the other so it's very

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
on one side or the other so it's very
important<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.750> sure<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.020> buy<00:02:04.170> jiggers

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
important to make sure you buy jiggers

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319 
important to make sure you buy jiggers
that<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.829> marked<00:02:05.280> exactly<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that are marked exactly what the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
that are marked exactly what the
measures<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.710> may<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.920> tested<00:02:08.640> at

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
measures are and you may be tested at

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.770 
measures are and you may be tested at
home<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> make<00:02:09.090> sure<00:02:09.209> they<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
home to make sure they actually get the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.320 
home to make sure they actually get the
triggers<00:02:10.140> right<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.340> sizes<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.849> want<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> get

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
triggers right the sizes you want to get

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.050 
triggers right the sizes you want to get
could

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
could

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
could
run<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.390> gamut<00:02:13.660> everything<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.500> see<00:02:14.830> all

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
run the gamut everything and you see all

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.620 
run the gamut everything and you see all
sorts<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.370> different<00:02:15.430> things<00:02:15.760> from<00:02:15.910> one<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.599> a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
sorts of different things from one and a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.390 
sorts of different things from one and a
half<00:02:16.660> on<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:17.080> side<00:02:17.290> 22<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> other<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.250> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
half on one side 22 on the other and so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.229 
half on one side 22 on the other and so
forth<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.239> sizes<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:20.170> using<00:02:20.380> our<00:02:21.239> 2

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
forth the sizes that I like using our 2

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.190 
forth the sizes that I like using our 2
ounce<00:02:22.420> 1<00:02:22.660> ounce<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:24.599> three-quarter<00:02:25.599> one<00:02:25.900> half

ounce 1 ounce and three-quarter one half

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.350 
ounce 1 ounce and three-quarter one half
with<00:02:27.099> these<00:02:27.310> measures<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.000> basically

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
with these measures you can basically

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.290 
with these measures you can basically
make<00:02:28.690> most<00:02:29.590> drinks<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.670> give<00:02:30.819> me<00:02:30.880> some<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
make most drinks those give me some the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.150 
make most drinks those give me some the
kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.569> fuss<00:02:31.750> around<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.830> one's<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
kind of fuss around this one's going to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.199 
kind of fuss around this one's going to
fuss<00:02:33.340> her<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.489> little<00:02:33.610> bit<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.819> because<00:02:33.910> I've

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
fuss her a little bit just because I've

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.630 
fuss her a little bit just because I've
got<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.420> use<00:02:34.510> two<00:02:34.540> measures<00:02:35.140> rather<00:02:35.769> than<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
got to use two measures rather than the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.250 
got to use two measures rather than the
one<00:02:36.849> I'd<00:02:37.030> use<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.480> Ox<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:37.810> let's<00:02:38.080> take<00:02:38.200> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
one I'd use of the Ox so let's take a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.680 
one I'd use of the Ox so let's take a
look<00:02:38.410> how<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.620> works<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.330> I'm<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.569> use

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
look how it works so I'm going to use

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
look how it works so I'm going to use
one<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> half<00:02:41.140> ounces<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:42.099> rye<00:02:42.310> whiskey<00:02:45.330> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
one and a half ounces of rye whiskey so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.690 
one and a half ounces of rye whiskey so
just<00:02:48.430> fill<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.819> top<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.330> pour<00:02:49.660> one<00:02:50.319> ounce

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.500 

half<00:02:54.700> ounce<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.880> use<00:02:58.030> three-quarter

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
half ounce and we use three-quarter

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.420 
half ounce and we use three-quarter
ounce<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.930> driving<00:02:59.349> with<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.370> a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
ounce of driving with which now have a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.740 
ounce of driving with which now have a
three-quarter<00:03:04.030> on<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:04.780> side<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
three-quarter on this side and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.559 
three-quarter on this side and
three-quarter<00:03:10.750> ounce<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.140> pineapple<00:03:11.980> juice

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
three-quarter ounce of pineapple juice

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.640 
three-quarter ounce of pineapple juice
of<00:03:13.569> course<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> want<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.230> sure<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.560> use

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
of course you want to make sure you use

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.650 
of course you want to make sure you use
the<00:03:14.739> unsweetened<00:03:15.610> pineapple<00:03:16.299> juice<00:03:16.510> or

the unsweetened pineapple juice or
fresh-squeezed<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.170> can<00:03:20.440> which<00:03:20.980> is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
fresh-squeezed if you can which is

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.440 
fresh-squeezed if you can which is
pineapple<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.640> kind<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.820> rather<00:03:22.090> hard<00:03:22.359> to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
pineapple to kind of rather hard to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.550 
pineapple to kind of rather hard to
squeeze<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:25.480> pineapple<00:03:26.019> juice<00:03:26.230> since

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
squeeze now with pineapple juice since

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.930 
squeeze now with pineapple juice since
it<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.739> an<00:03:26.920> opaque<00:03:27.190> ingredient<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.790> might

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
it is an opaque ingredient you might

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.039 
it is an opaque ingredient you might
want<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.150> think<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.359> want<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.600> shake<00:03:28.840> this

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
want to think you want to shake this

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.930 
want to think you want to shake this
instead<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.530> stirring<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.459> problem<00:03:30.850> with

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
instead of stirring it the problem with

instead of stirring it the problem with
pineapple<00:03:31.510> juice<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.260> enzymes<00:03:32.709> cause<00:03:32.980> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
pineapple juice is the enzymes cause it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.640 
pineapple juice is the enzymes cause it
to<00:03:33.400> foam<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.569> little<00:03:34.810> bit<00:03:34.930> more<00:03:35.109> than<00:03:35.410> orange

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
to foam up a little bit more than orange

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.470 
to foam up a little bit more than orange
juice<00:03:35.769> or<00:03:36.040> lime<00:03:36.190> juice<00:03:36.400> does<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.030> prefer<00:03:37.329> to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
juice or lime juice does so I prefer to

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.900 
juice or lime juice does so I prefer to
stir<00:03:37.959> pineapple<00:03:38.650> juice<00:03:38.829> unless<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.640> want<00:03:39.819> the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
stir pineapple juice unless you want the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:04:06.670 
stir pineapple juice unless you want the
phone<00:03:40.060> rather<00:03:40.329> than<00:03:40.540> shake<00:03:40.750> it

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.680 

we<00:04:07.680> strain<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.100> into<00:04:08.220> our<00:04:08.340> cocktail<00:04:08.850> glass

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.789 

and<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.959> problems<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.320> pineapple

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and one of the problems of pineapple

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.370 
and one of the problems of pineapple
juice<00:04:19.860> is<00:04:20.190> quite<00:04:20.400> often<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.910> kind<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
juice is quite often it kind of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
juice is quite often it kind of
overpowers<00:04:22.380> with<00:04:23.040> its<00:04:23.190> flavor<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.580> lot<00:04:23.820> of

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
overpowers with its flavor a lot of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850
