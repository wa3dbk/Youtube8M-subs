00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
before it I thought it was a bug if it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.540 
before it I thought it was a bug if it

it<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> side<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.290> goes<00:03:14.530> away<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:14.980> really

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it to the side and goes away it's really

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.480 
it to the side and goes away it's really

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
that much but um there aren't many

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.440 
that much but um there aren't many
windows<00:03:49.180> phones<00:03:49.480> if<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.050> haven't<00:03:50.170> noticed<00:03:50.290> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
windows phones if you haven't noticed so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.000
