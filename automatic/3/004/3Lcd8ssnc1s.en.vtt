the motherboard the sound card is part
of<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.940> motherboard<00:00:07.250> we<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.460> right<00:00:08.730> here

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
of the motherboard we have right here

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.680 
of the motherboard we have right here
the<00:00:09.179> outputs<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.610> surround<00:00:11.610> sound<00:00:11.790> system

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
input on the back side this is the I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.420 
input on the back side this is the I
don't<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.430> network<00:00:24.029> jack<00:00:24.449> i<00:00:24.949> lon

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
don't know what the network jack i lon

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.839 
don't know what the network jack i lon
Jack<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.180> think<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.689> called<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.460> hook<00:00:29.640> this

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
Jack I think you called it you hook this

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.040 
Jack I think you called it you hook this
up<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.330> computer<00:00:31.170> network<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> jack

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
up to a computer network using this jack

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.000 
up to a computer network using this jack
these<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.350> four<00:00:34.829> USB<00:00:35.399> ports<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.530> one

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
these are four USB ports and this is one

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.270 
these are four USB ports and this is one
single<00:00:38.579> fire<00:00:39.270> wire<00:00:39.660> port<00:00:42.230> down<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.920> then

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
single fire wire port down here we then

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
single fire wire port down here we then
have<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.410> high<00:00:46.410> dog<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.920> don't<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.579> think

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
have the high dog I don't know I think

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.400 
have the high dog I don't know I think
it's<00:00:48.870> called<00:00:49.250> ps2<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.579> something<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it's called ps2 or something like that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.770 
it's called ps2 or something like that
but<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.379> keyboard<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.100> mouse

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
but it's for the keyboard and the mouse

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.470 
but it's for the keyboard and the mouse
so<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.289> you've<00:00:58.710> seen<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.520> connectors<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so now you've seen all the connectors of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
so now you've seen all the connectors of
this<00:01:00.960> computer<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.910> all<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.979> features<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
this computer and all the features this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.440 
this computer and all the features this
has<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> main<00:01:09.560> specifications<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> now

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
has and the main specifications so now

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.440 
has and the main specifications so now
I'm<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.500> hook<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.520> place<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.299> my

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I'm going to hook this up in place of my

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010 
I'm going to hook this up in place of my
old<00:01:15.659> computer<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.119> we'll<00:01:18.119> take<00:01:18.390> another<00:01:18.570> look

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
old computer and we'll take another look

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
old computer and we'll take another look
at<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.590> before<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.189> continue<00:01:20.640> with

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
at it well before we can continue with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
at it well before we can continue with
the<00:01:21.570> computer<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:24.170> found<00:01:25.170> another<00:01:25.560> thing

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
keyboard comes in the same finish as the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.790 
keyboard comes in the same finish as the
computer<00:02:01.480> which<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.900> really<00:02:01.930> attracting<00:02:02.680> to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
computer which is really attracting to

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.830 
computer which is really attracting to
dust<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.660> this<00:02:04.660> we<00:02:04.930> type<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.830> there<00:02:06.070> it's<00:02:06.840> well

it's<00:02:08.380> cheap

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it's cheap

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.070 
it's cheap
I<00:02:09.039> don't<00:02:09.460> like<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.910> even<00:02:10.509> though<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.899> has

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
I don't like it even though it has

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.920 
I don't like it even though it has
thousands<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.040> special<00:02:12.910> function<00:02:13.420> keys<00:02:13.660> up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
thousands of special function keys up

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.690 
thousands of special function keys up
there<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.450> sits<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.470> old<00:02:17.740> computer<00:02:18.490> I

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
there and there sits the old computer I

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.530 
there and there sits the old computer I
just<00:02:19.120> unhooked<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.180> could<00:02:22.360> see

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
just unhooked it and well you could see

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.150 
just unhooked it and well you could see
the<00:02:22.690> only<00:02:22.840> thing<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.350> sucked<00:02:23.770> up<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the only thing that sucked up to the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.340 
the only thing that sucked up to the
computer<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.450> antenna<00:02:25.990> for

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
computer right now is the antenna for

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.229 
computer right now is the antenna for
the<00:02:26.500> wireless<00:02:26.800> LAN<00:02:27.220> card<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.990> also<00:02:28.990> found<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
the wireless LAN card I also found the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.830 
the wireless LAN card I also found the
wireless<00:02:31.350> keyboard<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.620> came<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.580> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
wireless keyboard that came with this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.890 
wireless keyboard that came with this
computer<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
computer and as you can see it's in the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.020 
computer and as you can see it's in the
original<00:02:38.080> plastic<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.190> has<00:02:39.220> never<00:02:39.820> been

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030

opened and never been used

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.220 
opened and never been used
I<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.820> computer<00:02:43.450> lot<00:02:45.390> because<00:02:46.390> this

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
I like this computer lot because this

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.100 
I like this computer lot because this
was<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.370> most<00:02:48.760> reliable<00:02:49.270> computer<00:02:49.959> I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
was really the most reliable computer I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.470 
was really the most reliable computer I
ever<00:02:50.440> had<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.160> can<00:02:51.489> remember<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:52.060> older
