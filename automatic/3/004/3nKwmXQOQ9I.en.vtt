00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.860 

this<00:01:09.320> laser<00:01:09.620> cools<00:01:10.160> by<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> blast<00:01:11.120> of<00:01:11.390> cold<00:01:11.660> air

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
this laser cools by a blast of cold air

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.300 
this laser cools by a blast of cold air
you<00:01:12.110> should<00:01:12.290> be<00:01:12.380> feeling<00:01:12.560> some<00:01:12.800> cold<00:01:13.100> air

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
you should be feeling some cold air

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.590 
you should be feeling some cold air
there

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.980 

there<00:01:17.140> should<00:01:17.290> be<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.439> relatively<00:01:17.920> quick

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
there should be a relatively quick

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.420 
there should be a relatively quick
treatment<00:01:19.990> as<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.500> underarms<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.070> actually

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
treatment as the underarms is actually

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.630 
treatment as the underarms is actually
not<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.610> very<00:01:21.850> big<00:01:21.909> area<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.070> here<00:01:24.369> we're<00:01:24.490> ready

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
not a very big area so here we're ready

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.830 
not a very big area so here we're ready
to<00:01:24.790> go<00:01:25.380> how's<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.650> feel

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.690 

a<00:01:29.960> little<00:01:30.560> sting<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:31.159> little<00:01:31.399> bit<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.549> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
a little sting just a little bit of it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.340 
a little sting just a little bit of it
like<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> rubber<00:01:32.119> band<00:01:32.329> snap<00:01:33.429> okay<00:01:34.429> good

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
like a rubber band snap okay good

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.800 
like a rubber band snap okay good
so<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.100> hair<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.430> reacting<00:01:37.970> very<00:01:38.150> nicely<00:01:38.390> some

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
so the hair is reacting very nicely some

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.429 
so the hair is reacting very nicely some
of<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.960> hairs<00:01:39.170> are<00:01:39.439> just<00:01:40.130> flying<00:01:40.430> out<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
of the hairs are just flying out of the

00:01:41.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
of the hairs are just flying out of the
follicles<00:01:42.439> which<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:43.250> fate

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.759 

okay<00:02:09.780> let's<00:02:10.019> say<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:12.769> underarm

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
okay let's say that's not that underarm

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.720 
okay let's say that's not that underarm

nothing<00:03:23.739> yeah<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:25.209> was<00:03:25.540> really<00:03:25.720> nothing<00:03:25.930> so

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
nothing yeah it was really nothing so

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.660 
nothing yeah it was really nothing so
I'm<00:03:26.770> going<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.950> go<00:03:27.069> ahead<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.250> take<00:03:27.430> off<00:03:27.610> your

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.140 

so<00:03:32.740> that's<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.070> end<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.340> treatment<00:03:33.580> is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
so that's the end of the treatment is

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.760 
so that's the end of the treatment is
actually<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.570> pretty<00:03:34.780> quick<00:03:35.080> treatment<00:03:35.320> our

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
actually a pretty quick treatment our

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.430 
actually a pretty quick treatment our
laser<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.250> quite<00:03:36.610> fast<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.450> regard<00:03:37.810> and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
laser is quite fast in that regard and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.880 
laser is quite fast in that regard and
it<00:03:38.590> doesn't<00:03:38.860> require<00:03:38.950> any<00:03:39.520> additional<00:03:40.890> yeah

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
it doesn't require any additional yeah

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.500 
it doesn't require any additional yeah
you're<00:03:42.160> going<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.550> do<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.850> total<00:03:43.420> of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
you're going to have to do a total of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
you're going to have to do a total of
five<00:03:43.660> treatments<00:03:43.960> spaced<00:03:44.710> out<00:03:44.860> one<00:03:45.070> month

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
five treatments spaced out one month

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.510 
five treatments spaced out one month
apart<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:47.020> area<00:03:47.350> will<00:03:47.500> be<00:03:47.590> slightly<00:03:47.890> pink<00:03:48.310> at

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
apart the area will be slightly pink at

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.840 
apart the area will be slightly pink at
