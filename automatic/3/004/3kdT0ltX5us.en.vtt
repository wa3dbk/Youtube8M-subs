00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 where you can quickly use cheap Gaddafi elected propaganda police verkoop.nl 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.280
 code times time the quarterly digits 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.520
 the law in the making whereby students urban museum with children who 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.009
 trying to make play were also back again 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.969
 when they do that if you haven't done this yet it is very busy 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.800
 showed your support if the instructions of the team why drop 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.279
 because it's real 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.400
 oldekerk difference but with this team the game really box you can get through here 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.400
 if it is also ridiculous but that is hard to have on the pole 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.140
 of course ask that question now 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.190
 the actor is also must I just scored another penalty with the keeper 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.930
 sounds easy but you must be able to get a penalty and that is not 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.420
 always just as easy has ipad 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.129
 when the right digging is back in order and regularity 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 since then it was not too good nine at the time he knows this you know 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.350
 enter prize left center does not work the members of the felius board may only go on 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.300
 a run to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 and I really and really is not everything 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.700
 And you can tell there was so many people that inflation worked on CD and handcuffed and that 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.219
 sounds lower in recent weeks by looking well 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.219
 he has bought good players but that they do not fit in a team with each other 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.689
 but that's how it is making 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.390
 I could tell the pair is broke meaning the ball admits that stoke 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.320
 so absolutely cupboard the keeper picks up on the role on a sporting can therefore argue 2 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.119
 the load was on the ball 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.230
 gives a band that noted with euros a bit to cast 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.360
 sports 3 0 but then you just know yes that is reasonable can this man 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050
 what a bit of bad luck at those protests the best match of his life to it 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.730
 play 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.920
 i have to put up with a god this is not so bad and that strikes me too 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 men go beautiful 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.659
 but that was the idea behind good game site will try czech republic 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.800
 haven't got anything yet 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.310
 but the keeper knows with a grab and then he goes into the Koppenberg north 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.710
 is 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.810
 I know conditions keeper a verbal defender and so scored duty against one 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.010
 nice the milk glands where Chris soaked he still has the ball the governments 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.869
 have busier children of obs each and who scored 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.000
 against the nets bierkaai beyond beautiful pot dominated just a lot better 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.340
 climate the brit still won s7 team spirit against this team bombast 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.479
 69 in ten weeks 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.390
 but it was always the best team I donate that this conclusion was I can 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.990
 for that the gun mark I was so bad that I don't want to go 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.540
 doing that was another goal 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.949
 that's ahead of him by driving red through with the ball 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.039
 what a suit i'm doing with the weighting turned out to be just the operation 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.089
 what i really want nothing i didn't even have it from mushroom 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.909
 I have it so bad but really very good good outdoor bullet double 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.640
 as I never actually care 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.660
 what I have I am completely happy to guard 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.720
 I give him a try that this moment throws shooting direction and we do 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.150
 are in limitation against p but I am a little vaulted hence the in 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.629
 EPE 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.500
 with that one on one attentive one good possibly not on the road 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.560
 this also comes 2 and in the 84th minute or just nice at least six minutes 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.500
 to get hold of against his team or to go back put putes in the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.020
 beam this ball and this head-roll very nice done by Arjen Robben as every DJ duo 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.440
 did it fine I am also not at the start yes I deserve the asphalt to work 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.069
 goes a shot at goal 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.739
 in 90 minutes time that a little let us condemn dictate I still have 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.269
 still not belgian for a keeper and then I think what if you are against this 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.120
 team does not meet then I also do not know what he does not need this just out 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.860
 to keep the market out 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
 and I went a little week went out the week also a little dribbling you know what 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.920
 also a community come there also the command area of ​​tackling and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.830
 that there is so much that i see a lot of time here that i also go the making it 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.920
 nothing at all I have picked up there then give the bell to have had it but 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.330
 it just doesn't want to park nicely at the ball 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.580
 you may be by a bit the looks he does not get defend i have not 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.089
 the idea that the starting student association can participate 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.659
 that is short of it was really very bad 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.709
 You also see a reasonable salary if he just doesn't do anything I want 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.480
 just calling is just a supporter 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.440
 how do you get another opec once such a techno shoots again 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.480
 shoot late night you go to the two ago rolled and then shoot through there 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.720
 from here the inside goes pile and then I think I already know I am 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.659
 fairly spacious week earlier against a reasonable ipad so we will continue as usual 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.849
 van apple he takes the ball out and tries to round it up a bit 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.879
 a bit nicer to a bit of the ball 40 minutes into the game, biopower intercepted and 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.640
 you know how later through that the fight stems from the selection krol there are one 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.549
 few years just he is just in the party and very lucky but 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.440
 I am therefore more fortunate because I have more to do with Van Dale 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.590
 the here and the back you know what if I actually called this already 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.200
 for employers, this also means that they can continue to receive the contract 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.199
 and he tries a wider and painting now becomes a whole series of cups 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.489
 And that means that I have six games that a sign that we are now again 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.609
 get a new player 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.659
 and that player is it 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.110
 he is just what said the number two test sections as in the apartment 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.120
 now becomes 10 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.449
 petter if there is of course 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.309
 I had let him count this department as large as a ship, but me 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.789
 know inc on a very pursuit point out that not done you can follow it too 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.790
 on twitter and yes I would like to let you know 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.650
 that is with the experience of voters leaving gel behind
