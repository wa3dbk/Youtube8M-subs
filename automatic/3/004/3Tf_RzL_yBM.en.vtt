00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
just like how you took it apart you want

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
just like how you took it apart you want
to<00:02:44.000> start<00:02:44.239> with<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.450> front<00:02:44.720> first<00:02:44.930> though

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.220 

first<00:02:50.900> piece<00:02:51.200> goes<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:52.090> second<00:02:53.090> piece<00:02:53.269> on<00:02:53.450> top

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.930

make sure this is facing up against the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:55.390 
make sure this is facing up against the
trigger

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.650 

and<00:03:56.400> once<00:03:56.640> that's<00:03:56.880> through<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.330> put<00:03:57.540> the

needle back in now if you're another

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.770 
needle back in now if you're another
advice<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.610> your<00:04:05.760> needle<00:04:06.090> does<00:04:06.330> not<00:04:06.510> go

advice if your needle does not go

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.130 
advice if your needle does not go
through<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:08.400> airbrush<00:04:09.030> then<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:09.930> this

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
through the airbrush then you have this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.410 
through the airbrush then you have this
charter<00:04:10.650> backwards<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.820> there<00:04:12.210> is<00:04:12.390> a

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
charter backwards because there is a

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.270 
charter backwards because there is a
slot<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:13.050> here<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> needle<00:04:13.860> go<00:04:14.010> through

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
slot in here for the needle go through

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.800 
slot in here for the needle go through
