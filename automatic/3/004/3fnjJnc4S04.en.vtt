hello everyone this video is about the
touch<00:00:03.030> ID<00:00:03.330> sensor<00:00:03.589> being<00:00:04.589> just<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.190> mere

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
touch ID sensor being just a mere

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.240 
touch ID sensor being just a mere
gimmick<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.120> really<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:07.220> practical<00:00:08.220> life

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
gimmick and really in practical life

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.970 
gimmick and really in practical life
it's<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.150> very<00:00:09.389> limited<00:00:09.599> functionality<00:00:10.559> if<00:00:10.800> at

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
it's a very limited functionality if at

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.810 
it's a very limited functionality if at
all<00:00:11.599> firstly<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.719> set<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.559> try<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.400> set<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.700> up

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
all firstly to set to try to set it up

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.269 
all firstly to set to try to set it up
you<00:00:15.089> need<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.929> under<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> settings<00:00:16.890> part

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
you need to go under the settings part

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.120 
you need to go under the settings part
of<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:17.850> phone<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.390> then<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.800> down

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of your phone and then you just go down

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.689 
of your phone and then you just go down
to<00:00:20.520> where<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.970> says<00:00:21.000> touch<00:00:21.720> ID<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> passcode

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
to where it says touch ID and passcode

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.939 
to where it says touch ID and passcode
now<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> click<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.390> you'll<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.470> asked

now if you click on that you'll be asked

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550 
now if you click on that you'll be asked
to<00:00:26.010> give<00:00:26.160> your<00:00:26.580> passcode<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> passcode

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to give your passcode this is a passcode

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.820 
to give your passcode this is a passcode
where<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> set<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.760> unlock<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> screen

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
where you set to unlock the screen

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
where you set to unlock the screen
without<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> touch<00:00:32.099> ID<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.700> generally

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
without the touch ID this is generally

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.450 
without the touch ID this is generally
setup<00:00:33.899> when<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.469> set<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:35.040> phone<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
setup when you set up your phone for the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
setup when you set up your phone for the
very<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:35.850> time<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> basically<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.480> after

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
very first time so basically then after

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.369 
very first time so basically then after
that<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.860> screen<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
that you come to a screen like this

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
that you come to a screen like this
where<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:44.070> gives<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> option<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> add<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
where it gives you the option to add a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.020 
where it gives you the option to add a
fingerprint<00:00:46.350> turn<00:00:46.680> passcode<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.789> change

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
fingerprint turn passcode off or change

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.080 
fingerprint turn passcode off or change
your<00:00:48.210> passcode<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.879> add

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
your passcode so here if you want to add

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.170 
your passcode so here if you want to add
your<00:00:51.570> touch<00:00:51.780> ID<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.699> add

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
your touch ID all you need to do is add

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.560 
your touch ID all you need to do is add
a<00:00:55.079> fingerprint<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.120> let<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.360> show<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a fingerprint here but let me show you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.860 
a fingerprint here but let me show you
this<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.680> place<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.070> finger<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.870> but

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this if you place your finger here but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
this if you place your finger here but
the<00:01:01.199> touch<00:01:01.379> ID<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.340> bad<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the touch ID is really really bad it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.399 
the touch ID is really really bad it
doesn't<00:01:03.149> work<00:01:03.300> properly<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> try<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
doesn't work properly see if you try to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
doesn't work properly see if you try to
keep<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.949> finger<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.630> gives<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
keep your finger here it just gives you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
keep your finger here it just gives you
random<00:01:10.170> messages<00:01:10.799> saying<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.490> says<00:01:11.700> lift<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
random messages saying it says lift and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
random messages saying it says lift and
rest<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.780> finger<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.710> home<00:01:13.860> button

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
rest your finger on the home button

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.469 
rest your finger on the home button
repeatedly<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.479> try<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:17.479> repeatedly

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
repeatedly so if I try this repeatedly

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
repeatedly so if I try this repeatedly

put it see how terrible that a Chinese

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510 
put it see how terrible that a Chinese
sensor<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.080> try<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.310> goes

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
sensor is we will try and put it it goes

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
sensor is we will try and put it it goes
there

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
there
sorry<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.650> we<00:01:28.650> try<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.280> put<00:01:29.550> the

and then it works a bit but then it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.290 
and then it works a bit but then it
doesn't<00:01:35.820> work<00:01:35.940> at<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.490> cava<00:01:38.820> Holmberg

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
doesn't work at all this cava Holmberg

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.880 
doesn't work at all this cava Holmberg
completely<00:01:39.930> even<00:01:40.170> though<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.409> trying<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
completely even though I'm trying to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.859 
completely even though I'm trying to
cover<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> bottom<00:01:41.580> completely<00:01:42.360> doesn't<00:01:43.260> work

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:02:02.719 

see

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.779 

see<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.860> defective<00:02:05.670> piece<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.090> kit<00:02:06.330> I

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
see it's really defective piece of kit I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
see it's really defective piece of kit I
did<00:02:08.789> add<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> fingerprint<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.080> didn't

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
did add a fingerprint and it didn't

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:48.110 
did add a fingerprint and it didn't
recognize<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:12.110> see

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.089 

see<00:02:48.810> when<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.080> try<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.260> place<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.620> finger

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
see when you try to place your finger

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.220 
see when you try to place your finger
from<00:02:50.190> different<00:02:50.610> sides<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.599> doesn't<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
from different sides it doesn't like to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.330 
from different sides it doesn't like to
take<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:54.270> strange<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
take in it it's just really strange and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.740 
take in it it's just really strange and
basically<00:02:56.340> both<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.670> touch<00:02:56.849> ID<00:02:57.150> sensor<00:02:57.270> does

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
basically both the touch ID sensor does

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.030 
basically both the touch ID sensor does
that<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.020> takes<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.380> really<00:02:58.410> high-resolution

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that it takes a really high-resolution

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.490 
that it takes a really high-resolution
