be<00:00:35.390> at<00:00:35.690> 12<00:00:35.720> o'clock<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.970> witness<00:00:38.570> mark

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
be at 12 o'clock the the witness mark

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.750 
be at 12 o'clock the the witness mark
and<00:00:39.110> you're<00:00:39.500> going<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.680> push<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.130> down<00:00:40.370> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
and you're going to push this down and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.020 
and you're going to push this down and
now<00:00:41.750> your<00:00:42.020> iris<00:00:42.470> activator<00:00:43.070> will<00:00:43.310> operate<00:00:43.880> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
now your iris activator will operate the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.230 
now your iris activator will operate the
iris<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.890> release<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.400> lens<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:46.820> just<00:00:47.030> do

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
iris and to release the lens you just do

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.920 
iris and to release the lens you just do
the<00:00:47.390> opposite

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.920 

so<00:00:53.930> read<00:00:54.380> supplies<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.829> torx<00:00:55.309> tool<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.809> got<00:00:56.809> this

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
so read supplies a torx tool I got this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.830 
so read supplies a torx tool I got this
with<00:00:57.110> my<00:00:57.260> epic<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.160> t10<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:58.940> believe

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
with my epic and it's the t10 I believe

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.799 
with my epic and it's the t10 I believe
it's<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.079> Torx<00:01:00.410> plus<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.970> remove<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.540> four

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
it's a Torx plus and you remove the four

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.780 
it's a Torx plus and you remove the four
screws<00:01:02.860> holding<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.030> lens<00:01:05.030> mount<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:07.550> came

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
screws holding the lens mount that came

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.480 
screws holding the lens mount that came
from<00:01:08.030> red<00:01:11.110> there<00:01:12.110> are<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.680> addition<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.369> these

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
from red there are in addition to these

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.440 
from red there are in addition to these
four<00:01:13.850> holes<00:01:14.150> there<00:01:14.869> are<00:01:15.110> two<00:01:15.470> locating<00:01:16.070> holes

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
four holes there are two locating holes

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.420 
four holes there are two locating holes
and<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.990> prevents<00:01:18.680> them<00:01:18.830> out<00:01:18.979> from<00:01:19.250> being

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
and this prevents them out from being

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.790 
and this prevents them out from being
installed<00:01:19.850> upside<00:01:20.300> down<00:01:20.509> because<00:01:20.900> they're

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
installed upside down because they're

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.820 
installed upside down because they're
not<00:01:22.420> they're<00:01:23.420> not<00:01:23.450> in<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.900> same<00:01:24.140> place<00:01:24.350> top

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
not they're not in the same place top

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.650 
not they're not in the same place top
the<00:01:25.009> bottom<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.580> can't<00:01:25.940> install<00:01:26.300> them<00:01:26.509> out

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
the bottom so you can't install them out

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.370 
the bottom so you can't install them out
from<00:01:27.229> upside<00:01:28.009> down<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.570> then<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:29.960> allows

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
from upside down and then this allows

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.450 
from upside down and then this allows
make<00:01:31.340> sure<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.000> recess<00:01:32.600> which<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> here

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
make sure that this recess which is here

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.330 
make sure that this recess which is here
is<00:01:34.630> around<00:01:35.630> these<00:01:35.899> pins<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:36.590> these<00:01:36.740> pins<00:01:37.100> make

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is around these pins so these pins make

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.609 
is around these pins so these pins make
no<00:01:37.580> electrical<00:01:38.090> contact<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.990> lens<00:01:39.170> mount<00:01:39.470> is

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
no electrical contact the lens mount is

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.550 
no electrical contact the lens mount is
very<00:01:39.920> secure<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.520> not<00:01:40.700> moving<00:01:40.940> up<00:01:41.570> up<00:01:42.350> or

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
very secure it's not moving up up or

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.020 
very secure it's not moving up up or
down<00:01:42.710> or<00:01:42.740> left<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.250> right<00:01:43.399> now<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:43.580> even<00:01:43.880> put

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
down or left to right now but even put

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.719 
down or left to right now but even put
any<00:01:44.119> screws<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.190> we're<00:01:46.190> not<00:01:46.340> going<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.610> have

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
any screws in so we're not going to have

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.660 
any screws in so we're not going to have
any<00:01:47.020> shorting<00:01:48.020> or<00:01:48.170> any<00:01:48.560> problems<00:01:48.950> here<00:01:49.310> with

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
any shorting or any problems here with

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.690 
any shorting or any problems here with
these<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.940> gold-plated<00:01:50.390> electrical<00:01:51.170> contacts

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
these a gold-plated electrical contacts

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.249 
these a gold-plated electrical contacts
the<00:01:52.700> other<00:01:52.729> thing<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.300> realize<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
the other thing to realize is that the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.580 
the other thing to realize is that the
mount<00:01:54.470> itself<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:55.009> black<00:01:55.280> anodized<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.660> that

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
mount itself is black anodized and that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.949 
mount itself is black anodized and that
makes<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.099> very<00:01:58.280> hard<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:59.030> surfaces<00:01:59.720> is

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
makes it very hard the surfaces is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.290 
makes it very hard the surfaces is
aluminum<00:02:00.770> oxide<00:02:01.190> which<00:02:01.429> is<00:02:01.580> basically<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
aluminum oxide which is basically the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.809 
aluminum oxide which is basically the
same<00:02:02.709> material<00:02:03.709> that<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.860> find<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.340> sandpaper

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
same material that you find in sandpaper

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.419 
same material that you find in sandpaper
it's<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.179> very<00:02:05.450> hard<00:02:05.869> surface<00:02:06.530> very<00:02:07.160> long

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's a very hard surface very long

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.580 
it's a very hard surface very long
wearing<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.929> other<00:02:09.080> thing<00:02:09.289> that's<00:02:09.319> nice

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
wearing and the other thing that's nice

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.490 
wearing and the other thing that's nice
about<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.450> non<00:02:11.660> conductive<00:02:12.319> for

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
about it is that it's non conductive for

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.350 
about it is that it's non conductive for
example<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.130> multimeter<00:02:13.489> here<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.380 

you'll<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:19.099> mount<00:02:19.310> itself<00:02:19.459> does

you'll see that the mount itself does

problems with this amount and the camera
one<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:29.599> have<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.930> recess<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
one we have the recess to we have the

one we have the recess to we have the

going to use the the torques tool that

red<00:02:56.290> supplies<00:02:56.740> with<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.280> camera<00:02:58.180> and<00:03:00.480> just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
red supplies with the camera and just

snug these up don't over tighten them
it's<00:03:03.580> very<00:03:03.880> strong<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.540> an<00:03:04.660> excellent

it's very strong it's an excellent

it's very strong it's an excellent
system<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.710> think<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:06.130> red<00:03:06.310> has<00:03:06.460> devised<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
system I think that red has devised and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.440 
system I think that red has devised and
then<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.920> at<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.760> point<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.300> can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
then you can at this point you can

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.730 
then you can at this point you can
decide<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.230> want<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:13.320> check<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.500> depth

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
decide that you want to check the depth

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.040 
decide that you want to check the depth
flange<00:03:15.220> focal<00:03:15.460> distance<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> adjustment

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
flange focal distance and the adjustment

for<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> camera<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.190> right<00:03:18.430> here<00:03:18.850> I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
for that on the camera is right here I

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.160 
for that on the camera is right here I
doubt<00:03:21.580> most<00:03:21.850> people<00:03:22.330> will<00:03:22.510> ever<00:03:22.600> have<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.050> do

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
doubt most people will ever have to do

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.500 
doubt most people will ever have to do
that<00:03:23.380> between<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.130> PL<00:03:24.490> mount<00:03:24.760> supplied<00:03:25.270> by

that between the PL mount supplied by

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.260 
that between the PL mount supplied by
red<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> canon<00:03:26.350> mount<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.770> our<00:03:26.890> nikon<00:03:27.340> mount
