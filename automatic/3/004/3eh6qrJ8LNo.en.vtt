 My name is Alejandro GarcÃ­a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.160
 my name of your skin corn 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 my name is our Baptist 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.870
 let's invent boys 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.840
 in this average of the musical scale 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.330
 of music the second interpret 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.430
 experimentally sound through 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.080
 elements of the way it has and the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.879
 third analyze the amount of 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.250
 approximate in which necessary for 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.090
 play musical notes 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.360
 necessary materials for this 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.930
 laboratory are crystal glasses water a 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.150
 pitch and the musical scale the first 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.159
 cup with a water of stock that has 45 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 milliliters about cubic centimeter of 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.250
 Water 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.120
 a drink with water the king who is 60 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.120
 milliliters 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.900
 the third cup of water is my one that has 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.170
 75 milliliters 2 cubic centimeters of 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.170
 Water 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.570
 here is like with water the sun that has 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.570
 105 milliliters 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.220
 lasexta2 cup is the one that has 120 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.490
 milliliters over cubic centimeters of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 Water 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.330
 the seventh cup is the note so 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 contains 135 milliliters centimeters 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.530
 tobacco with water is what has 150 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.530
 milliliters about cubic centimeter 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.690
 we learned to draw experimentally 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.100
 musicals through glasses of water 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.350
 second this nation lab is a 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.350
 little about sound waves and music 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 and that after 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.310
 the amount 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.150
 Standby
