very<00:01:05.159> easy<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:06.119> acceptable<00:01:06.840> um<00:01:07.939> somewhat

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
very easy very acceptable um somewhat

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
very easy very acceptable um somewhat
argue<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> system

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
argue it's not as good as the system

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
argue it's not as good as the system
magazine<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> goes

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
magazine just because of the way it goes

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580 
magazine just because of the way it goes
so<00:01:14.189> far<00:01:14.520> back<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.509> system<00:01:15.689> magazine<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> know

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so far back the system magazine you know

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
so far back the system magazine you know
it<00:01:16.770> goes<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.070> forward<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.659> more

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it goes a bit forward and is a lot more

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.310 
it goes a bit forward and is a lot more
balanced<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> might<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.570> what<00:01:21.570> works<00:01:21.869> for

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
balanced so that might be what works for

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
balanced so that might be what works for
you<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.479> better

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

you but I just like this better
personally<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> bigger<00:01:26.670> opening<00:01:27.240> up

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
personally it's got a bigger opening up

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.740 
personally it's got a bigger opening up
top<00:01:28.159> along<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.700> using<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.270> dials

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
top along with that I'm using the dials

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
top along with that I'm using the dials
head<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.259> love<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.070> head<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.729> probably<00:01:32.820> my

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
head I love this head it's probably my

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.899

favorite<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.740> rapid-fire

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
favorite for rapid-fire

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.990 
favorite for rapid-fire
one<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> best<00:01:37.049> four<00:01:37.409> rapid-fire

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
one of the best four rapid-fire

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
one of the best four rapid-fire
undoubtably<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.530> grip<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
undoubtably just because of the grip it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.260 
undoubtably just because of the grip it
provides<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.820> top<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> only<00:01:44.270> cross

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
provides up top it's the only cross

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
provides up top it's the only cross
fight<00:01:45.600> head<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.500> goes<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.250> far

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
fight head part that goes this far

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.969 
fight head part that goes this far
forward<00:01:48.210> which<00:01:48.689> allows<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> finger

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
forward which allows you to put a finger

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
forward which allows you to put a finger
way<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.409> very

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
way up here and I think that's very

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
way up here and I think that's very
comfortable<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.000> allows<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.630> sort

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
comfortable it also allows you to sort

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.600 
comfortable it also allows you to sort
of<00:01:54.960> push<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.420> solid

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
of push down there and get a very solid

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.319 
of push down there and get a very solid
shooting<00:01:59.610> ground<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.360> guess<00:02:01.009> also<00:02:02.030> using<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
shooting ground I guess also using the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.139 
shooting ground I guess also using the
sword<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.140> arm<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.490> clearly

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
sword one arm just because it's clearly

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.219 
sword one arm just because it's clearly
the<00:02:06.540> best<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.500> handed<00:02:07.950> grip<00:02:08.250> arm<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.970> there

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the best one handed grip arm out there

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.320 
the best one handed grip arm out there
way<00:02:10.890> better<00:02:11.129> than<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
way better than the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.900 
way better than the
great<00:02:12.720> version<00:02:12.990> from<00:02:13.590> Mocs<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.160> sword<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
great version from Mocs a sword and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.130 
great version from Mocs a sword and
better<00:02:15.900> than<00:02:16.170> either<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.220> device<00:02:17.870> arms<00:02:18.870> in

better than either of the device arms in
my<00:02:19.380> opinion<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.630> using<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.110> burst<00:02:22.350> bison

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
my opinion now I'm using the burst bison

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.970 
my opinion now I'm using the burst bison
trigger<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.650> just<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.740> very

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
trigger because this is just a very

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860 
trigger because this is just a very
versatile<00:02:26.550> trigger<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.240> good<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.690> power

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
versatile trigger it's good for power

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.140 
versatile trigger it's good for power
types<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.830> good<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.190> control<00:02:29.580> types<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
types it's good for control types and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.700 
types it's good for control types and
it's<00:02:30.270> especially<00:02:30.720> good<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.200> rapid<00:02:31.680> fire

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
it's especially good for rapid fire

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.220 
it's especially good for rapid fire
types<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.910> sort<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.210> emulate<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
types because it can sort of emulate the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.070 
types because it can sort of emulate the
same<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.010> trigger<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.420> roll<00:02:36.780> says

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
same kind of trigger that roll says

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.480 
same kind of trigger that roll says
sword<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> moxa<00:02:37.920> sword<00:02:38.190> uses<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.060> loop

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
sword and moxa sword uses with the loop

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.400 
sword and moxa sword uses with the loop
very<00:02:41.490> good<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.820> rapid<00:02:42.090> fire<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.140> core

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
very good for rapid fire now the core

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.310 
very good for rapid fire now the core
I'm<00:02:43.590> using<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.420> bit<00:02:45.540> interesting<00:02:45.930> a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
I'm using is a little bit interesting a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.090 
I'm using is a little bit interesting a
lot<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.800> people<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.400> opted<00:02:47.880> straight<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
lot of people just opted straight to the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.970 
lot of people just opted straight to the
sonic<00:02:50.610> core<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:52.020> core<00:02:52.560> don't

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
sonic core and that's a good core don't

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.810 
sonic core and that's a good core don't
get<00:02:53.160> me<00:02:53.310> wrong<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.440> lacks<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
get me wrong I think it just lacks a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.530 
get me wrong I think it just lacks a
significant<00:02:57.810> amount<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.440> power<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.180> can

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
significant amount of power so you can

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.060 
significant amount of power so you can
see<00:03:00.900> here<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:02.790> barely<00:03:03.420> knocks<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.650> pin

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
see here like it barely knocks that pin

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.820 
see here like it barely knocks that pin
over<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.970> when<00:03:06.390> playing<00:03:06.720> brake<00:03:07.110> bomber<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
over and when playing brake bomber it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.000 
over and when playing brake bomber it
barely<00:03:08.580> knocks<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.630> bombs<00:03:09.900> through<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
barely knocks the bombs through the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.320 
barely knocks the bombs through the
tower<00:03:11.959> that's<00:03:12.959> not<00:03:13.170> ideal<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.209> doesn't<00:03:15.209> work

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
tower that's not ideal and doesn't work

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.540 
tower that's not ideal and doesn't work

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
for a whole lot of situations don't get

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.340 
for a whole lot of situations don't get
me<00:03:17.670> wrong<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.269> said<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.690> great<00:03:18.959> for

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
me wrong like I said it's great for

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.630 
me wrong like I said it's great for
rapid<00:03:19.709> fire<00:03:19.739> it's<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.489> very<00:03:21.269> speedy<00:03:21.930> core<00:03:22.640> it's

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
rapid fire it's a very speedy core it's

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.390 
rapid fire it's a very speedy core it's
just<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.239> very<00:03:24.269> versatile<00:03:25.110> now<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:26.070> lot<00:03:26.370> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
just not very versatile now a lot of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.020 
just not very versatile now a lot of
people<00:03:26.610> also<00:03:27.090> opt<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:28.140> using<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.160> device<00:03:29.190> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
people also opt for using the device to

people also opt for using the device to
leg<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.050> lot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.800> mobility<00:03:32.280> probably

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
leg it's got a lot of mobility probably

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
leg it's got a lot of mobility probably
the<00:03:33.180> best<00:03:33.510> for<00:03:33.870> mobility<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.040> whole

the best for mobility in the whole

once<00:03:36.330> again<00:03:36.480> that's<00:03:36.870> very<00:03:36.930> true<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:37.709> you'll

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
once again that's very true but you'll

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.180 
once again that's very true but you'll
notice<00:03:39.000> here<00:03:39.600> I'm<00:03:39.830> not<00:03:40.830> using<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.940> power<00:03:42.420> block

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
notice here I'm not using a power block

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.940 
notice here I'm not using a power block
that's<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.580> because<00:03:45.140> through<00:03:46.140> testing<00:03:46.739> I

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that's just because through testing I

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.770 
that's just because through testing I
found<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:48.170> when<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.230> am<00:03:50.040> rapid<00:03:50.880> firing<00:03:51.300> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
found that when I am rapid firing the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.330 
found that when I am rapid firing the
power<00:03:51.930> block<00:03:52.200> will<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.560> straight<00:03:52.800> up<00:03:52.830> fall

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
power block will just straight up fall

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.800 
power block will just straight up fall
off<00:03:53.580> because<00:03:54.330> Rev<00:03:55.050> is<00:03:56.090> one<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.330> older

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
off because Rev is one of the older

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.770 
off because Rev is one of the older
cores<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.500> thus<00:03:59.010> does<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.390> latch

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
cores and thus does not have a latch

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.710 
cores and thus does not have a latch
system<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:02.130> doesn't<00:04:02.340> have<00:04:02.580> anything<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:03.269> top

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
system it doesn't have anything up top

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.090 
system it doesn't have anything up top
for<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.530> newer<00:04:04.940> stabilizers<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.769> slot<00:04:07.769> into

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
for the newer stabilizers to slot into

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.630 
for the newer stabilizers to slot into
so<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.570> decided<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.320> have<00:04:10.620> nothing<00:04:11.190> back

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
so I just decided to have nothing back

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.699 
so I just decided to have nothing back
here<00:04:12.060> at<00:04:12.239> all<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.049> because<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.500> that

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
here at all and and because of that

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.350 
here at all and and because of that
there's<00:04:14.370> not<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> whole<00:04:14.700> lot<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.880> back<00:04:15.120> support

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
there's not a whole lot of back support

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.020 
there's not a whole lot of back support
and<00:04:15.840> he<00:04:16.200> would<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.440> fall<00:04:16.739> over<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.519> instead

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
and he would just fall over so instead

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.670 
and he would just fall over so instead
of<00:04:18.090> using<00:04:18.660> Sonic<00:04:19.560> or<00:04:20.299> device<00:04:21.299> 2<00:04:21.780> for<00:04:22.320> my<00:04:22.440> leg

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.300 
of using Sonic or device 2 for my leg
part<00:04:23.039> I'm<00:04:23.310> using<00:04:23.970> the

pieces on the back just to support him a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.810 
pieces on the back just to support him a
little<00:04:32.570> bit<00:04:32.750> when<00:04:33.139> he's<00:04:33.350> not<00:04:33.650> loaded<00:04:34.250> at<00:04:34.430> least

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
little bit when he's not loaded at least

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.860 
little bit when he's not loaded at least
when<00:04:35.720> he<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:35.900> loaded<00:04:36.350> he'll<00:04:36.919> support<00:04:37.600> up<00:04:38.600> to

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
when he is loaded he'll support up to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.230 
when he is loaded he'll support up to
the<00:04:38.960> point<00:04:39.230> where<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.919> start<00:04:40.220> loading<00:04:40.460> into

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the point where you start loading into

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.600 
the point where you start loading into
the<00:04:43.360> wide<00:04:44.360> magazine<00:04:44.900> itself<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.740> even<00:04:46.130> then

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
the wide magazine itself and even then

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.740 
the wide magazine itself and even then
the<00:04:48.010> burst<00:04:49.010> bison<00:04:49.490> trigger<00:04:49.790> will<00:04:50.060> keep<00:04:50.330> him<00:04:50.570> up

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the burst bison trigger will keep him up

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.810 
the burst bison trigger will keep him up
now<00:04:51.110> if<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:51.350> did<00:04:51.560> use<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.950> system<00:04:52.340> magazine

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
now if you did use the system magazine

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.970 
now if you did use the system magazine
it<00:04:53.060> would<00:04:53.210> offset<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.840> weight<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:54.230> lot<00:04:54.650> better

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
it would offset the weight a lot better

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.190 
it would offset the weight a lot better
and<00:04:55.280> he<00:04:55.669> wouldn't<00:04:55.940> fall<00:04:56.150> over<00:04:56.510> especially

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
and he wouldn't fall over especially

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560 
and he wouldn't fall over especially
considering<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.190> metal<00:04:58.520> Rev<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:59.150> it's

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
considering it's the metal Rev and it's

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.040 
considering it's the metal Rev and it's
got<00:04:59.720> all<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.200> front<00:05:00.919> weight<00:05:01.160> anyway<00:05:01.729> I<00:05:02.050> just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
got all this front weight anyway I just

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.219 
got all this front weight anyway I just
think<00:05:03.470> metal<00:05:03.620> Rev<00:05:03.919> is<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:05.120> lot<00:05:05.389> more<00:05:05.540> solid<00:05:05.870> a

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
think metal Rev is a lot more solid a

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.409 
think metal Rev is a lot more solid a
lot<00:05:06.410> more<00:05:06.560> stable<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.370> lot<00:05:07.550> more<00:05:07.580> smooth

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
lot more stable and a lot more smooth

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.070 
lot more stable and a lot more smooth
even<00:05:09.110> though<00:05:09.680> Sonic<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.669> a<00:05:10.700> pretty<00:05:11.570> smooth<00:05:11.840> to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
even though Sonic is a pretty smooth to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.629 
even though Sonic is a pretty smooth to
be<00:05:12.200> in<00:05:12.320> with<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.620> just<00:05:12.860> like<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.280> way<00:05:13.460> this

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
be in with I just like the way this

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.230 
be in with I just like the way this
functions<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.479> bit<00:05:14.660> better<00:05:15.280> all<00:05:16.280> of<00:05:16.340> that<00:05:16.820> said

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
functions a bit better all of that said

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.120 
functions a bit better all of that said
let's<00:05:17.600> actually<00:05:17.780> do<00:05:18.169> some<00:05:18.440> tests<00:05:18.860> I'm<00:05:18.979> not

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
let's actually do some tests I'm not

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.219 
let's actually do some tests I'm not
going<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.310> do<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.430> power<00:05:19.639> test<00:05:20.030> because<00:05:20.419> nothing

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
going to do a power test because nothing

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.150 
going to do a power test because nothing
really<00:05:21.490> changes<00:05:22.490> much<00:05:22.760> from<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.510> normal

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
really changes much from the normal

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.050 
really changes much from the normal
drove<00:05:25.160> ice<00:05:25.340> core<00:05:26.240> here<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.930> normal<00:05:27.430> metal<00:05:28.430> Rev

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
drove ice core here the normal metal Rev

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.719 
drove ice core here the normal metal Rev
so<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:30.229> mean<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:30.890> slightly<00:05:31.160> less<00:05:31.520> powerful

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
so I mean it's slightly less powerful

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.700 
so I mean it's slightly less powerful
just<00:05:32.270> because<00:05:32.479> there's<00:05:32.630> no<00:05:32.750> power<00:05:32.990> block<00:05:33.380> but

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
just because there's no power block but

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.680 
just because there's no power block but
not<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.160> whole<00:05:34.310> lot<00:05:34.460> changes<00:05:34.820> anyway<00:05:35.240> what<00:05:35.660> I

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
not a whole lot changes anyway what I

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.360 
not a whole lot changes anyway what I
really<00:05:35.990> wanted<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.260> do<00:05:36.470> in<00:05:36.620> this<00:05:36.710> video<00:05:36.919> is

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
really wanted to do in this video is

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.770 
really wanted to do in this video is
just<00:05:37.400> fire<00:05:38.060> off<00:05:38.360> a<00:05:38.600> lot<00:05:39.140> of<00:05:39.410> shots<00:05:40.100> so<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:41.330> have<00:05:41.479> a

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
just fire off a lot of shots so I have a

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.520 
just fire off a lot of shots so I have a
hundred<00:05:42.169> marbles<00:05:42.770> here<00:05:43.100> and<00:05:43.340> I'm<00:05:43.550> just<00:05:43.760> gonna

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
hundred marbles here and I'm just gonna

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.460 
hundred marbles here and I'm just gonna
shoot<00:05:45.530> them<00:05:45.680> all<00:05:45.800> off<00:05:46.300> there's<00:05:47.320> not<00:05:48.320> a<00:05:48.350> whole

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
shoot them all off there's not a whole

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.890 
shoot them all off there's not a whole
lot<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.650> say<00:05:48.919> anyway<00:05:49.400> let's<00:05:49.760> get<00:05:50.000> started

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
lot to say anyway let's get started

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.580 
lot to say anyway let's get started
once<00:05:51.830> again<00:05:51.919> I<00:05:52.250> love<00:05:52.669> how<00:05:53.360> easy<00:05:53.750> it<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.080> to<00:05:54.380> just

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
once again I love how easy it is to just

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.879 
once again I love how easy it is to just
load<00:05:55.130> marbles<00:05:55.970> into<00:05:56.240> this<00:05:56.690> magazine<00:05:57.139> but

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
load marbles into this magazine but

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:21.450 
load marbles into this magazine but
getting<00:05:58.340> started

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.080 

and<00:06:22.460> there<00:06:22.670> you<00:06:22.760> go

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
and there you go

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.530 
and there you go
hundred<00:06:23.480> shots<00:06:23.660> pretty<00:06:24.590> easy<00:06:24.800> um<00:06:25.220> again<00:06:25.910> it

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
hundred shots pretty easy um again it

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.460 
hundred shots pretty easy um again it
works<00:06:26.780> really<00:06:27.260> well<00:06:27.410> for<00:06:27.620> me<00:06:28.510> but<00:06:29.510> rapid-fire

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
works really well for me but rapid-fire

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.260 
works really well for me but rapid-fire
is<00:06:30.590> very<00:06:30.770> suggestive<00:06:31.010> what<00:06:31.670> works<00:06:31.880> for<00:06:31.970> me<00:06:32.120> is

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
is very suggestive what works for me is

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.140 
is very suggestive what works for me is
not<00:06:32.540> quite<00:06:33.410> gonna<00:06:33.890> work<00:06:34.130> for<00:06:34.430> everyone<00:06:34.940> else

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
not quite gonna work for everyone else

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.210 
not quite gonna work for everyone else
you<00:06:35.660> just<00:06:35.690> sort<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.110> have<00:06:36.170> to<00:06:36.350> play<00:06:36.530> around<00:06:36.890> and

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
you just sort of have to play around and

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.370 
you just sort of have to play around and
and<00:06:37.400> build<00:06:38.060> something<00:06:38.420> suited<00:06:38.990> for<00:06:39.200> you

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
and build something suited for you

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.230 
and build something suited for you
everyone<00:06:39.830> has<00:06:39.980> different<00:06:40.130> sized<00:06:40.550> hands

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
everyone has different sized hands

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.180 
everyone has different sized hands
everyone<00:06:41.660> has<00:06:42.080> a<00:06:42.470> different<00:06:43.720> mental<00:06:44.830> pace<00:06:45.830> I

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
everyone has a different mental pace I

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.260 
everyone has a different mental pace I
guess<00:06:46.460> there's<00:06:47.120> a<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:48.560> lot<00:06:49.040> of<00:06:49.280> variables<00:06:49.940> in

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
guess there's a a lot of variables in

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.220 
guess there's a a lot of variables in
rapid<00:06:50.900> fire<00:06:50.930> it's<00:06:51.920> a<00:06:52.100> lot<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:53.020> listening<00:06:54.020> I

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
rapid fire it's a lot of listening I

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.590 
rapid fire it's a lot of listening I
think<00:06:54.590> yeah<00:06:55.280> you<00:06:55.370> have<00:06:55.610> to<00:06:55.670> listen<00:06:56.120> to<00:06:56.150> marbles

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
think yeah you have to listen to marbles

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.230 
think yeah you have to listen to marbles
go<00:06:56.720> into<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.050> chamber<00:06:57.560> and<00:06:57.970> everyone<00:06:58.970> has

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
go into the chamber and everyone has

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.560 
go into the chamber and everyone has
different<00:06:59.750> abilities<00:07:00.020> so<00:07:01.120> build<00:07:02.120> what'll

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
different abilities so build what'll

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.970 
different abilities so build what'll
work<00:07:02.690> for<00:07:03.080> you

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
work for you
