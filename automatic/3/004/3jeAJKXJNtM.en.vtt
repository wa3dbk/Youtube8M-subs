completely<00:01:03.300> different<00:01:03.780> using<00:01:04.439> players<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
contrast and it's really really cool so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
contrast and it's really really cool so
it<00:01:09.180> mixed<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.260> lead<00:01:10.439> 21<00:01:10.680> players

more<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.520> an<00:01:14.790> interesting<00:01:15.060> twist<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
more of an interesting twist and it's a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
more of an interesting twist and it's a
really<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.860> solid<00:01:17.189> team<00:01:17.549> especially<00:01:17.909> the

like<00:02:52.200> i<00:02:52.350> said<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.830> start<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.280> think<00:02:53.520> it

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
like i said at the start I think it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.180 
like i said at the start I think it
really<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.200> benefit<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.800> team<00:02:55.830> if

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
really really does benefit the team if

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.430 
really really does benefit the team if
you<00:02:56.340> don't<00:02:56.580> do<00:02:56.760> already<00:02:56.970> these<00:02:57.660> are<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.170> ones

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the start of each game and then have to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.840 
the start of each game and then have to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
really struggled at the style quite a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.870 
really struggled at the style quite a
few<00:03:55.530> games<00:03:55.769> you'll<00:03:56.070> see<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.459> clips<00:03:56.700> I

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
few games you'll see in the clips I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.699 
few games you'll see in the clips I
might<00:03:57.360> be<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> gold<00:03:57.810> down<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> try<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
might be a gold down and I try and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.830 
might be a gold down and I try and
equalizer<00:03:59.250> managed<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.820> which<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.600> awesome

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
equalizer managed to which is awesome

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.660

but<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.200> kind<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.560> don't<00:04:01.830> want<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.580> do

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
but I kind of don't want to have to do

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.030 
but I kind of don't want to have to do
that<00:04:02.700> because<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.330> know<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.290> come<00:04:04.560> back<00:04:04.739> like

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that because I know I can come back like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.240 
that because I know I can come back like
most<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.519> time<00:04:05.670> I'm<00:04:05.910> playing<00:04:06.840> right<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:08.040> can

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
most of time I'm playing right and I can

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.680 
most of time I'm playing right and I can
make<00:04:08.370> something<00:04:08.610> happen<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.180> game<00:04:09.450> I

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
make something happen like this game I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.680 
make something happen like this game I
was<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.320> know<00:04:10.470> down<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.190> managed<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.640> win<00:04:11.910> 53

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.199 
was to know down and I managed to win 53
in<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.870> end<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.590> was<00:04:14.070> tempted<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.880> quit

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
in the end so I was tempted to quit

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.390 
in the end so I was tempted to quit
because<00:04:15.450> he's<00:04:16.169> gone<00:04:16.410> too<00:04:16.650> ridiculously

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
because he's gone too ridiculously

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.280 
because he's gone too ridiculously
annoying<00:04:17.640> goals<00:04:18.030> I'm<00:04:18.540> glad<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.870> didn't<00:04:19.229> because

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
annoying goals I'm glad I didn't because

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.409 
annoying goals I'm glad I didn't because
I<00:04:19.470> managed<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.950> score<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.120> girls

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
I managed to score a lot of girls

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.870 
I managed to score a lot of girls
without<00:04:22.169> conceding<00:04:22.620> anymore<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.490> had<00:04:23.640> such

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
without conceding anymore but I had such

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.490 
without conceding anymore but I had such
a<00:04:24.150> terrible<00:04:24.479> start<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.169> what<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.350> found

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
a terrible start that's what I found

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.620 
a terrible start that's what I found
this<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.919> him<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.430> was<00:04:26.640> weird<00:04:26.850> but<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.270> a

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
this to him it was weird but it's a

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.750

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
think it was just me playing a little

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
think it was just me playing a little
bit<00:04:31.740> bad<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.100> let<00:04:32.610> me<00:04:32.700> know<00:04:32.820> how<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.030> guys<00:04:33.270> find

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the team if you try it because on paper

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.180 
the team if you try it because on paper
it<00:04:36.090> looks<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:36.690> an<00:04:36.840> absolutely<00:04:37.530> astonishing
