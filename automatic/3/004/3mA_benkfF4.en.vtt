00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
little drum works is it's kind of a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.539 
little drum works is it's kind of a
little<00:01:34.229> rubber<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.890> top<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.180> little

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
little rubber on top and it has little

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
little rubber on top and it has little
screw<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> tighten<00:01:40.470> down

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the screw the drum actually expands and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
the screw the drum actually expands and
so<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.720> band<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
will actually expand as you tighten this

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.639 
will actually expand as you tighten this
little<00:01:50.220> screw<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> hold<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> band<00:01:51.840> tightly

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
little screw and hold the band tightly

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
little screw and hold the band tightly
together<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.759> 8<00:01:56.759> inch<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
together and so this is a 8 inch a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
together and so this is a 8 inch a
little<00:01:57.810> rod<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.130> fit<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> type

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
little rod which will fit in this type

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
little rod which will fit in this type

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.240 
piece here and just make sure it's tight
then<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.060> put<00:02:08.300> your<00:02:08.540> little<00:02:09.610> band<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:12.160> put<00:02:13.160> it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
then you put your little band on put it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.690 
then you put your little band on put it
on<00:02:13.540> center<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.310> then<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.490> use

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
on center there and then you use

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.460 
on center there and then you use
actually<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.300> think<00:02:17.390> grab<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> different

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
actually I think grab a different

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.940 
actually I think grab a different
screwdriver<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:20.140> let<00:02:21.140> me<00:02:21.260> find<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.740> where's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
screwdriver here let me find one where's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.490 
screwdriver here let me find one where's
my<00:02:22.100> skewers

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
my skewers

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
my skewers
it's<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.710> screwdriver<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:29.440> then<00:02:30.910> just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
it's in the screwdriver and then just

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.119 
it's in the screwdriver and then just
tighten<00:02:32.300> it

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.739 

so<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.819> doesn't<00:02:37.999> feel<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.269> it's<00:02:38.569> going<00:02:38.689> to

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:38.749 
so it doesn't feel like it's going to

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.440 
so it doesn't feel like it's going to
come<00:02:38.959> off<00:02:38.989> okay<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.879> we're<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.389> to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
come off okay and so we're just going to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.599 
come off okay and so we're just going to
sand<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.349> little<00:02:42.620> bit<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.040> see<00:02:43.280> how<00:02:43.489> it

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
sand this a little bit and see how it

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.670 
sand this a little bit and see how it
works<00:02:44.920> put<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> low<00:02:46.280> setting<00:02:46.519> for<00:02:46.879> now

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
works put it on a low setting for now

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.849 
works put it on a low setting for now
oops

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
oops

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.509 
oops
plugging<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.810> first<00:02:50.810> step<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.349> any<00:02:51.709> project<00:02:52.310> is

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
plugging it first step of any project is

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.929 
plugging it first step of any project is
splitting<00:02:52.969> things<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:56.060> second<00:02:57.819> all<00:02:58.819> right

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
splitting things in one second all right

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:19.510 
splitting things in one second all right
let's<00:02:59.239> try<00:02:59.329> it<00:02:59.420> again

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.130 

that<00:03:20.520> looks<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.150> works<00:03:21.510> pretty<00:03:21.840> darn

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
that looks like it works pretty darn

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.890 
that looks like it works pretty darn
good<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.500> got<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.250> close<00:03:23.610> inside<00:03:24.270> here

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
good I got really close inside here

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.630 
good I got really close inside here
let's<00:03:25.350> see<00:03:25.530> if<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.710> can<00:03:25.920> do<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.400> top

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
let's see if I can do it from the top

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.610 
let's see if I can do it from the top
and<00:03:26.970> see<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:28.050> get<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.320> little

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and see if it I can get this little

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:38.910 
and see if it I can get this little
groove<00:03:28.950> here

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080 

what<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.160> didn't<00:03:40.460> get<00:03:40.520> all<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.790> way<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.060> course

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
what it didn't get all the way of course

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.720 
what it didn't get all the way of course
because<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.260> too<00:03:42.560> has<00:03:42.740> limitations<00:03:43.130> in<00:03:43.490> size

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
because it too has limitations in size

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.000 
because it too has limitations in size
but<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.390> getting<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> lot<00:03:45.110> closer<00:03:45.440> than<00:03:45.650> my<00:03:45.950> do

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
but it's getting a lot closer than my do

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.270 
but it's getting a lot closer than my do
it<00:03:46.310> did<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.150> let's<00:03:47.360> go<00:03:47.540> ahead<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.810> swap<00:03:48.740> off<00:03:48.980> to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
it did so let's go ahead and swap off to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.500 
it did so let's go ahead and swap off to
the<00:03:49.370> quarter<00:03:49.640> inch<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:49.940> see<00:03:50.090> if<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.210> can<00:03:50.390> do<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
the quarter inch and see if I can do a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.190 
the quarter inch and see if I can do a
little<00:03:50.750> bit<00:03:50.840> better<00:03:52.150> okay<00:03:53.150> got<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:53.780> it's

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
little bit better okay got it on it's

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.040 
little bit better okay got it on it's
also<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.560> eighth<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:55.130> an<00:03:55.250> inch<00:03:55.430> bar<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.390> works

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
also a eighth of an inch bar and works

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.570 
also a eighth of an inch bar and works
on<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.260> same<00:03:57.440> principle<00:03:57.980> as<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.220> tighten<00:03:58.430> up

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
on the same principle as you tighten up

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.930 
on the same principle as you tighten up
the<00:03:58.730> screw<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.600> expands<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.350> rubber<00:04:00.940> gasket

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
the screw it expands the rubber gasket

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.000 
the screw it expands the rubber gasket
in<00:04:02.090> there<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.600> tightens<00:04:03.380> everything<00:04:03.440> up<00:04:03.800> so

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
in there and tightens everything up so

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
in there and tightens everything up so
let's<00:04:04.190> give<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.580> shot

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.640 

well<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.060> was<00:04:29.240> expected<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:29.900> works<00:04:30.110> just<00:04:30.380> very

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
well I was expected this works just very

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.400 
well I was expected this works just very
similar<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.460> half<00:04:32.240> inch<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.810> think<00:04:33.139> that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
similar to the half inch I think that

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.810 
similar to the half inch I think that
half<00:04:33.590> inch<00:04:33.860> look<00:04:34.190> worked<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.520> little<00:04:34.669> bit

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
half inch look worked a little bit

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.450 
half inch look worked a little bit
better<00:04:34.880> give<00:04:35.330> me<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.509> little<00:04:35.690> surface<00:04:36.199> area

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
better give me a little surface area

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.879 
better give me a little surface area
this<00:04:37.460> maybe<00:04:37.820> in<00:04:38.300> some<00:04:38.660> I'm<00:04:39.410> not<00:04:39.440> sure<00:04:39.800> about

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
this maybe in some I'm not sure about

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.770 
this maybe in some I'm not sure about
this<00:04:40.160> little<00:04:40.310> square<00:04:40.699> but<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.300> let's<00:04:41.539> say<00:04:41.660> if

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
this little square but and let's say if

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.110 
this little square but and let's say if
you<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> circular<00:04:42.949> I<00:04:43.190> do<00:04:43.460> have<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.850> couple

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
you have a circular I do have a couple

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.330 
you have a circular I do have a couple
little<00:04:44.389> circles<00:04:45.050> here<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.949> this<00:04:46.190> would

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
little circles here that this would

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.700 
little circles here that this would
probably<00:04:46.699> fit<00:04:46.970> in<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.300> little<00:04:47.509> bit<00:04:47.750> better<00:04:47.960> to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
probably fit in a little bit better to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.670 
probably fit in a little bit better to
sign<00:04:49.009> around<00:04:49.190> but<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.150> max<00:04:50.600> these<00:04:51.080> are<00:04:51.229> actually

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
sign around but I max these are actually

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.770 
sign around but I max these are actually
pretty<00:04:52.190> handy<00:04:52.580> so<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:52.729> think<00:04:52.820> I'll<00:04:53.090> use<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.479> to

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
pretty handy so I think I'll use this to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.640 
pretty handy so I think I'll use this to
finish<00:04:54.110> up<00:04:54.320> my<00:04:54.590> hang<00:04:55.580> sanding<00:04:56.090> here<00:04:56.270> and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
finish up my hang sanding here and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.110 
finish up my hang sanding here and
hopefully<00:04:57.650> my<00:04:57.919> project<00:04:58.340> will<00:04:58.430> work<00:04:58.580> out<00:04:58.820> well

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
hopefully my project will work out well

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.050 
hopefully my project will work out well
I<00:04:59.740> hope<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.949> helped<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.250> out<00:05:01.400> I'll<00:05:01.699> see<00:05:01.970> you

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
I hope this helped you out I'll see you

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.900 
I hope this helped you out I'll see you
next<00:05:02.090> time<00:05:02.360> bye<00:05:02.870> bye
