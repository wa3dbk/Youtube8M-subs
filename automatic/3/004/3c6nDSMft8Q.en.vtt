big<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.780> think<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.260> pretty<00:02:20.500> sweet

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.710 
big and I think that was pretty sweet
and<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.910> what<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> want<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.270> talk<00:02:22.420> about<00:02:22.450> is

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and so what I want to talk about is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.210 
and so what I want to talk about is
gamakichi<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.500> might<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.830> able<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.980> play<00:02:24.070> as

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
gamakichi we might be able to play as

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.610 
gamakichi we might be able to play as
gamakichi<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:25.110> actually<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.530> see

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
gamakichi or actually you can see

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.790 
gamakichi or actually you can see
gamakichi<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.430> slug<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.030> Sasuke's<00:02:28.660> snake<00:02:29.620> so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
gamakichi the slug and Sasuke's snake so

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400 
gamakichi the slug and Sasuke's snake so
I<00:02:29.830> think<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.400> may<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.670> able<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.570> battle<00:02:32.110> as

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
I think we may be able to battle as

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.260 
I think we may be able to battle as
these<00:02:32.890> characters<00:02:33.460> as<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.000> it's

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
these characters as well I think it's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.670 
these characters as well I think it's
only<00:02:34.360> part<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> story<00:02:34.900> mode<00:02:35.470> I'm

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
only part of the story mode I'm

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.650 
only part of the story mode I'm

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
definitely looking at these screenshots

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.990 
definitely looking at these screenshots
their<00:02:38.200> story<00:02:38.740> mode<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.280> believe<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
their story mode I believe the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.210 
their story mode I believe the
screenshot<00:02:40.570> from<00:02:40.660> store<00:02:40.990> mud<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.380> snow

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
zooming in the bottom right hand corner

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.040 
zooming in the bottom right hand corner
you<00:02:44.500> also<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:44.920> Sasuke<00:02:45.400> Naruto<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.720> Sakura

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
you also see Sasuke Naruto and Sakura

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.110 
you also see Sasuke Naruto and Sakura

understand<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:16.660> thought<00:03:16.959> it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
understand and I actually thought it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.050 
understand and I actually thought it
would<00:03:17.230> be<00:03:17.380> when<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.830> look<00:03:17.980> at<00:03:18.100> first<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.760> um

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
would be when I look at first but um

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.310 
would be when I look at first but um
it's<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.630> gonna<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:19.810> really<00:03:19.930> something<00:03:20.140> so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
it's not gonna be really something so

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's not gonna be really something so
much<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.620> guess<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.310> looking<00:03:22.120> at<00:03:22.209> stone<00:03:22.450> fall

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
much I guess and looking at stone fall

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.449 
much I guess and looking at stone fall
of<00:03:22.959> workers<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.320> princeville<00:03:23.860> I<00:03:23.950> think<00:03:24.190> you

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
of workers in princeville I think you

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.920 
of workers in princeville I think you
know<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.700> company<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.150> stuck<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> portal

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
know the company is stuck on the portal

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.720 
know the company is stuck on the portal
they're<00:03:26.200> gonna<00:03:26.320> work<00:03:26.560> hard<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
they're gonna work hard on it and I

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.009 
they're gonna work hard on it and I
don't<00:03:27.910> think<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.180> me<00:03:28.300> complete<00:03:28.600> anytime

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
don't think it's me complete anytime

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.440 
don't think it's me complete anytime
soon<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.560> also<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.310> think<00:03:30.459> there<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> scan

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
soon and also I think there was a scan

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.800 
soon and also I think there was a scan
already<00:03:32.140> somewhere<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.640> this<00:03:33.940> game<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.450> going

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
already somewhere but this game is going

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.560 
already somewhere but this game is going
to<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:34.930> released<00:03:35.290> sometime<00:03:35.620> full<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.640> 4<00:03:36.970> 2015

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
to be released sometime full in 4 2015

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.330 
to be released sometime full in 4 2015
so<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:37.780> means<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.530> will<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.860> released<00:03:39.160> around
