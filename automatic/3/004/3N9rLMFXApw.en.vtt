kind of different things that prey on
the<00:01:11.820> crickets<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.140> tricks<00:01:13.350> under<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> lot

of stress and so we try to eliminate as

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
of stress and so we try to eliminate as
much<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:18.840> try<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> feed<00:01:19.470> them

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
know the reduction of stresses and key
thingy<00:01:48.720> thinks<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.350> every<00:01:49.590> day<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.399> know

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
people do to take that six weeks to go

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.050 
people do to take that six weeks to go
to<00:03:45.410> four<00:03:45.709> weeks<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.220> get<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.639> full-grown

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
to four weeks to get a full-grown

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.020 
to four weeks to get a full-grown
cricket<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.709> why<00:03:49.220> don't<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.639> do<00:03:49.819> those

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
cricket and and why don't you do those

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.500 
cricket and and why don't you do those
well<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:52.549> actually<00:03:52.700> feed<00:03:53.389> them

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
well you can you can actually feed them

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.270 
well you can you can actually feed them
a<00:03:53.599> hotter<00:03:53.810> fee<00:03:54.049> which<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.410> no<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.769> high<00:03:54.980> protein

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
a hotter fee which is no a high protein

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.479 
a hotter fee which is no a high protein
B<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.269> can<00:03:56.950> raise<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:57.980> temperature<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:58.459> your

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
B you can raise the temperature in your

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.569 
B you can raise the temperature in your
cricket<00:03:58.790> farm<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> higher<00:04:00.349> level<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.980> it'll

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
cricket farm to a higher level and it'll

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.920 
cricket farm to a higher level and it'll
make<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.790> creates<00:04:02.060> grow<00:04:02.209> faster<00:04:02.660> but<00:04:02.810> there

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
make it creates grow faster but there

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.650 
make it creates grow faster but there
won't<00:04:03.019> be<00:04:03.169> as<00:04:03.290> healthy<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.510> know

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
won't be as healthy just just you know

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.860 
won't be as healthy just just you know
think<00:04:06.560> we'll<00:04:06.709> say<00:04:06.859> they<00:04:07.040> are<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:07.599> just<00:04:08.599> I've

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
think we'll say they are but just I've

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.930 
think we'll say they are but just I've
never<00:04:08.930> seen<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.410> oh<00:04:09.829> it's<00:04:10.340> called<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.669> hot

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
never seen that oh it's called a hot

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.170 
never seen that oh it's called a hot
cricket

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
cricket

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.649 
cricket
and<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.579> insistence<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.420> come

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
and that we we have insistence to come

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.080 
and that we we have insistence to come
to<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.079> temptation<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:17.009> grow<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.250> hot<00:04:17.579> cricket

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
to that temptation to grow a hot cricket

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.979 
to that temptation to grow a hot cricket
to<00:04:18.239> cut<00:04:18.479> costs<00:04:18.989> right<00:04:19.530> night<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:21.449> think

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
to cut costs right night and I think

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.260 
to cut costs right night and I think
environment<00:04:22.979> has<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> lot<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.759> do<00:04:23.910> with<00:04:23.940> raising

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
environment has a lot to do with raising

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.110 
environment has a lot to do with raising
our<00:04:24.600> crickets<00:04:25.050> we're<00:04:26.009> in<00:04:26.130> Georgia<00:04:26.430> we're<00:04:26.880> sort

our crickets we're in Georgia we're sort

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.080 
our crickets we're in Georgia we're sort
of<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.300> middle<00:04:27.600> part<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.930> Georgia<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.910> what

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
of the middle part of Georgia and what

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.180 
of the middle part of Georgia and what
are<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.240> thoughts<00:04:30.479> one<00:04:31.199> thing<00:04:31.560> Georgia<00:04:32.070> is

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
are your thoughts one thing Georgia is

are your thoughts one thing Georgia is
such<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> good<00:04:32.759> place<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.240> grow<00:04:33.419> crickets<00:04:35.000> mms

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
such a good place to grow crickets mms

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.700 
such a good place to grow crickets mms
several<00:04:36.330> things<00:04:36.509> i<00:04:36.630> think<00:04:36.810> i<00:04:37.050> think<00:04:37.199> humidity

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
several things i think i think humidity

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.070 
several things i think i think humidity
has<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.919> lot<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.400> with<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.870> animal<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.020> uh

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
has a lot to do with it animal that uh

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.529 
has a lot to do with it animal that uh
you<00:04:40.740> know<00:04:40.889> sheds<00:04:41.310> its<00:04:41.460> skin<00:04:41.550> makes<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.360> certain

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
you know sheds its skin makes a certain

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:43.969 
you know sheds its skin makes a certain
amount<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.810> humidity<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.620> make<00:04:43.800> them<00:04:43.949> work

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
amount of humidity to make them work

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.060 
amount of humidity to make them work
right<00:04:47.330> all<00:04:48.330> right<00:04:48.539> where<00:04:49.259> we<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> hot

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
right all right where we have a hot

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.939 
right all right where we have a hot
climate<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.610> know<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.300> crickets<00:04:51.990> love<00:04:52.259> hot

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
climate I know that it crickets love hot

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.909 
climate I know that it crickets love hot
weather<00:04:53.220> right<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.270> know<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:55.500> can<00:04:55.680> get<00:04:55.800> them

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
weather right you know you can get them

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.460 
weather right you know you can get them
too<00:04:56.099> hot<00:04:56.340> but<00:04:56.669> at<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.000> same<00:04:57.180> time<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:58.289> need

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
too hot but at the same time you need

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.620 
too hot but at the same time you need
need<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.919> hot<00:04:59.130> environment<00:04:59.310> throw<00:04:59.849> me<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.210> you

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
need a hot environment throw me in you

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.490 
need a hot environment throw me in you
know<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:01.139> have<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.259> long<00:05:01.699> warm<00:05:02.699> season<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:04.020> we

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
know we have a long warm season so we

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.339 
know we have a long warm season so we
can<00:05:04.650> grow<00:05:04.740> Greg<00:05:05.009> is<00:05:05.660> probably<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.780> little<00:05:07.169> less

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
can grow Greg is probably a little less

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.320 
can grow Greg is probably a little less
expensive<00:05:07.889> than<00:05:07.919> people<00:05:08.220> up<00:05:08.280> north<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.759> yeah

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
expensive than people up north can yeah

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.839 
expensive than people up north can yeah
so<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.289> a<00:05:10.410> temperature<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.099> humidity<00:05:11.639> and

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
so it's a temperature and humidity and

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.089 
so it's a temperature and humidity and
you<00:05:12.810> know<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:12.960> find<00:05:13.289> throughout<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> United

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
you know you find throughout the United

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.860 
you know you find throughout the United
States<00:05:14.130> certain<00:05:14.849> things<00:05:15.120> grow<00:05:15.479> better<00:05:15.750> in

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
States certain things grow better in

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.379 
States certain things grow better in
certain<00:05:16.380> regions<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:17.520> region<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.210> we're

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
certain regions this region that we're

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.480 
certain regions this region that we're
in<00:05:18.539> really<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:19.050> ideally<00:05:19.740> suited<00:05:19.979> for<00:05:20.159> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
in really is ideally suited for the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.510 
in really is ideally suited for the
raising<00:05:20.909> growing<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.449> crickets<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:23.310> there

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
raising growing of crickets is there

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.120 
raising growing of crickets is there
anything<00:05:23.699> else<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.479> think<00:05:24.539> that<00:05:24.900> we<00:05:25.889> do

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
anything else that you think that we do

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.300 
anything else that you think that we do
that<00:05:26.460> maybe<00:05:27.030> sense<00:05:27.599> of<00:05:27.750> support<00:05:28.070> from<00:05:29.070> other

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
that maybe sense of support from other

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.820 
that maybe sense of support from other
ones<00:05:29.550> I'm<00:05:30.449> looking<00:05:30.630> thing<00:05:30.960> we<00:05:31.080> do<00:05:31.260> but<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.620> drink

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
ones I'm looking thing we do but I drink

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.950 
ones I'm looking thing we do but I drink
it<00:05:31.949> so<00:05:32.190> we<00:05:32.550> people<00:05:33.090> tell<00:05:33.240> us<00:05:33.270> every<00:05:33.599> day<00:05:33.630> how

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
it so we people tell us every day how

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.350 
it so we people tell us every day how
healthy<00:05:34.349> they<00:05:34.500> are<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.039> I<00:05:35.099> think<00:05:35.130> did<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.639> you

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
healthy they are and I think did it you

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.339 
healthy they are and I think did it you
know<00:05:36.479> if<00:05:36.570> you're<00:05:36.659> gonna<00:05:36.750> feed<00:05:37.020> your<00:05:37.169> pet
