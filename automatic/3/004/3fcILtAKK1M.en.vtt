00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
amazing what we can do with this

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.230 
amazing what we can do with this
technology<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.310> patient<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> fire<00:01:33.030> bed

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
technology the patient in the fire bed

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
technology the patient in the fire bed
cannot<00:01:33.990> breathe<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.439> his<00:01:34.680> own<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.850> he's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
cannot breathe on his own so he's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
cannot breathe on his own so he's
connected<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> ventilator<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.740> our

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
connected to a ventilator so our

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
connected to a ventilator so our
students<00:01:38.310> are<00:01:38.400> taught<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> care<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
students are taught how to care for that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.330 
students are taught how to care for that
patient<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
patient because when they go in the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
patient because when they go in the
hospital<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.240> ventilator<00:01:42.720> will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
hospital they see that ventilator will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.819 
hospital they see that ventilator will
they<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> do

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
they know what to do

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.770 
they know what to do
probably<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.390> they'll<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.689> an

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
probably not but here they'll have an

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
probably not but here they'll have an
opportunity<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> practice<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.829> learn<00:01:46.860> all

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
opportunity to practice and learn all

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.510 
opportunity to practice and learn all
about<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
about it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.859 
about it
so<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> room<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.689> their

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so this room is where they get their

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.389 
so this room is where they get their
supplies<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> hospital

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
supplies from just like in a hospital

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.380 
supplies from just like in a hospital
they<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> figure<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.030> supplies

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they have to figure out what supplies

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.270 
they have to figure out what supplies
they<00:01:51.600> need<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.380> machine<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.100> an

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they need that machine is actually an

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920 
they need that machine is actually an
electronic<00:01:53.820> machine<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
electronic machine they actually have to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690 
electronic machine they actually have to
put<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> code<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.829> their<00:01:55.979> fingerprint<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
put in a code put their fingerprint on

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
put in a code put their fingerprint on
and<00:01:56.939> withdraw<00:01:57.540> medications<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and withdraw medications just like in a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
and withdraw medications just like in a
hospital<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.640> Henry<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.090> actually<00:02:00.420> tomorrow

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
hospital so Henry is actually tomorrow

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
hospital so Henry is actually tomorrow
gonna<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.170> using<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> simulation<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.250> sickle

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
gonna be using a simulation a sickle

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
gonna be using a simulation a sickle
cell<00:02:02.790> anemia<00:02:03.149> crisis<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.960> tomorrow<00:02:04.619> actually

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
cell anemia crisis and tomorrow actually

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
cell anemia crisis and tomorrow actually
the<00:02:05.100> students<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.520> scheduled<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.909> come<00:02:06.000> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
getting all the machines ready they can

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
getting all the machines ready they can
actually<00:02:09.509> put<00:02:09.959> medication<00:02:10.739> through<00:02:10.920> his

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
actually put medication through his

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
cuz we want them to practice and train

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.089 
cuz we want them to practice and train
how<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.659> use<00:02:14.959> what<00:02:15.530> they<00:02:15.650> would<00:02:15.799> see<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.040> the
