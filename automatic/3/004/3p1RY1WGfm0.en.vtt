anything like that
Oh<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.420> my<00:02:22.450> practice<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.020> don't<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:23.380> any<00:02:23.560> tests<00:02:24.100> I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
Oh in my practice I don't do any tests I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
Oh in my practice I don't do any tests I
just<00:02:24.490> speak<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:24.970> people<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> listen<00:02:26.350> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
just speak with people and listen to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.980 
just speak with people and listen to
them<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> then<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.220> make<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> decision<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.360> what

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
them and then I make a decision in what

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.920 
them and then I make a decision in what
kind<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> illness<00:02:29.890> should<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:31.570> have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
kind of illness should be we don't have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.160 
kind of illness should be we don't have
