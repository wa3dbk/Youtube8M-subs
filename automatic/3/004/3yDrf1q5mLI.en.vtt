00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
because now is when I've been getting

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
because now is when I've been getting
the<00:03:05.880> question<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.080> form<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the question so I don't want to form a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.770 
the question so I don't want to form a
new<00:03:08.160> opinion<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:09.000> guess<00:03:09.240> because<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.660> already

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
new opinion I guess because I already

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.550 
new opinion I guess because I already
kind<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.560> an<00:03:10.650> opinion<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.460> him<00:03:11.940> so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
kind of do have an opinion on him so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.070 
kind of do have an opinion on him so
it's<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:13.740> nothing<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.310> good<00:03:14.460> things<00:03:15.080> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
it's really nothing but good things I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's really nothing but good things I
know<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.250> only<00:03:17.370> knocks<00:03:17.730> I've<00:03:18.030> heard<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.660> him

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
know the only knocks I've heard on him

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.860 
know the only knocks I've heard on him
are<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.440> he's<00:03:19.650> cocky<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.370> think<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:21.060> kind

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
are that he's cocky but I think he kind

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.540 
are that he's cocky but I think he kind
of<00:03:21.930> deserves<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.560> be<00:03:22.739> number<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.310> number

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
of deserves to be number one and number

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.420 
of deserves to be number one and number
two<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.360> think<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.320> lot<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.800> was<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.100> fun

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
two I think a lot of it was on fun

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.940 
two I think a lot of it was on fun
anyways<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.570> really<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:27.840> he<00:03:28.320> was

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
anyways and I don't really think he was

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.630 
anyways and I don't really think he was
really<00:03:30.590> serious<00:03:31.590> hundred<00:03:32.220> percent<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.580> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
really serious hundred percent of the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.300 
really serious hundred percent of the
time<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.410> that's<00:03:34.410> pretty<00:03:34.680> much<00:03:34.830> my<00:03:35.040> thoughts

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
time so that's pretty much my thoughts

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.150 
time so that's pretty much my thoughts
on<00:03:35.550> him<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.959> main<00:03:37.170> thing<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:38.130> I

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
has to do with is just the amount that

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
has to do with is just the amount that
your<00:04:58.650> body<00:04:58.860> can<00:04:59.100> change<00:04:59.430> in<00:04:59.760> a<00:05:00.240> week's<00:05:00.510> time

your body can change in a week's time

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.650 
your body can change in a week's time
just<00:05:01.260> due<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.860> foods<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.400> eat<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.820> it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
just due to the foods you eat and it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.780 
just due to the foods you eat and it
kind<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:03.930> seems<00:05:04.230> obvious<00:05:04.650> i<00:05:05.010> guess<00:05:05.250> but<00:05:05.430> i<00:05:05.520> just

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
kind of seems obvious i guess but i just

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.100 
kind of seems obvious i guess but i just
didn't<00:05:06.030> think<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.330> was<00:05:06.450> such<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> drastic

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
didn't think it was such a drastic

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.350 
didn't think it was such a drastic
change<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.370> that's<00:05:08.520> why<00:05:08.790> i<00:05:08.820> thought<00:05:09.180> it'd<00:05:09.330> be

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
change so that's why i thought it'd be

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.659 
change so that's why i thought it'd be
kind<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.720> cool<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.930> document<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.890> should<00:05:11.580> be

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
kind of cool to document it so should be

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.970 
kind of cool to document it so should be
