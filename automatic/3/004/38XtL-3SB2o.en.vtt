using<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> useful<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

degree<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.870> shooting<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
degree but when you're shooting really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
degree but when you're shooting really
small<00:00:55.620> targets<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> lose

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
small targets you're going to lose

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
small targets you're going to lose
precision<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> start<00:00:58.829> stretching

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
things out really far you're talking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
things out really far you're talking
about<00:01:00.899> trying<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> guess<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.190> half<00:01:02.550> mil<00:01:02.850> dot<00:01:03.090> or

about trying to guess a half mil dot or
three<00:01:03.809> quarters<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.350> million<00:01:05.900> limitations

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
three quarters of a million limitations

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
three quarters of a million limitations
to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> mil<00:01:07.320> dot<00:01:07.470> system<00:01:07.909> furthermore<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to the mil dot system furthermore have a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.950 
to the mil dot system furthermore have a
look<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:10.409> 100<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.520> 150<00:01:12.360> yard<00:01:12.600> range

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
look at this from 100 to 150 yard range

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.070 
look at this from 100 to 150 yard range
the<00:01:13.650> pellet<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.100> dropping<00:01:14.700> almost<00:01:14.939> three<00:01:15.720> feet

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the pellet is dropping almost three feet

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.789 
the pellet is dropping almost three feet
so<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.340> our<00:01:17.700> target<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.210> six<00:01:18.450> inches<00:01:18.750> high<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so if our target is six inches high and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.429 
so if our target is six inches high and
I<00:01:19.950> guess<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.820> 120<00:01:21.600> yards<00:01:21.720> when<00:01:22.320> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I guess it to be at 120 yards when it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
I guess it to be at 120 yards when it's
actually<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.860> 130<00:01:23.520> yards<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.360> almost<00:01:24.720> 8

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
actually at 130 yards that's almost 8

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually at 130 yards that's almost 8
inches<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.500> drop<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.610> miss<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> target

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
inches of drop I would miss the target

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.280 
inches of drop I would miss the target
entirely<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.400> why<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.290> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
entirely and that's why I use this so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.660 
entirely and that's why I use this so
today<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:32.009> show<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> guys<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
today I'm gonna show you guys what a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340 
today I'm gonna show you guys what a
powerful<00:01:33.000> device<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.170> long

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
powerful device this can be for long

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
powerful device this can be for long
range<00:01:34.560> shots<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:35.729> take<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.060> through<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
range shots well take a look through the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.289 
range shots well take a look through the
range<00:01:36.509> finder<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.439> we'll<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:37.770> our<00:01:37.950> shot<00:01:38.299> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
range finder and we'll take our shot so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
range finder and we'll take our shot so
back<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> original<00:01:40.049> example<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
back to this original example and the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
back to this original example and the
longest<00:01:41.729> shot<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.420> video<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.990> thought<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
longest shot on this video I thought the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
longest shot on this video I thought the
guy<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> right<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> red-winged

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
guy to the right was a red-winged

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
guy to the right was a red-winged
blackbird<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> guy<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> left<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
blackbird and the guy to the left was a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
blackbird and the guy to the left was a
Starling<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> thought<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> other<00:01:48.899> bird<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
Starling I thought that other bird was

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
Starling I thought that other bird was
actually<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> red-winged<00:01:49.950> blackbird<00:01:50.490> based<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
actually a red-winged blackbird based on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
actually a red-winged blackbird based on
his<00:01:51.810> profile<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.829> looked<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> month<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
his profile as I looked at a month of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
his profile as I looked at a month of
wire<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.970> seems<00:01:54.240> thinner<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> leaning<00:01:55.170> more

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
wire he seems thinner and leaning more

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
wire he seems thinner and leaning more
forward<00:01:55.890> starlings<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> lean<00:01:56.969> back<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
forward starlings kind of lean back and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.469 
forward starlings kind of lean back and
up<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.290> you've<00:01:58.469> seen<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.979> guy

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
up just like you've seen with this guy

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
up just like you've seen with this guy
so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> spot<00:02:00.899> these<00:02:01.049> birds<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.009> range<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so I spot these birds at a range that I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
so I spot these birds at a range that I
estimated<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.329> about<00:02:03.390> 125<00:02:04.320> yards<00:02:04.530> away

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
estimated to be about 125 yards away

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.580 
estimated to be about 125 yards away
based<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.149> pole<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.869> closest<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
based on the pole that was closest to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
based on the pole that was closest to
them

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
them

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050 
them
I'd<00:02:09.869> doped<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.410> wind<00:02:10.619> i<00:02:10.979> holdover<00:02:11.790> for

I'd doped for the wind i holdover for
the<00:02:12.120> trajectory<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.040> dock<00:02:14.240> my<00:02:15.240> uncle<00:02:15.569> was

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the trajectory and dock my uncle was

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
the trajectory and dock my uncle was
actually<00:02:15.990> standing<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.560> next<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.920> me

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
actually standing right next to me
during<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.370> shot<00:02:17.640> smiling<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.569> me<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.690> I
