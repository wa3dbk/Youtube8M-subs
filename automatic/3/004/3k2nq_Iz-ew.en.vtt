00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just an added bonus it involves a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
just an added bonus it involves a
culture<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
culture so it's like a kind of like a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
culture so it's like a kind of like a
fermentation<00:00:56.219> process<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.899> grow

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
fermentation process you and you grow

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
fermentation process you and you grow
something<00:00:58.770> called<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> Scobie<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.180> can

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
something called a Scobie you can

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970

purchase<00:01:00.539> mail-order<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.500> purchase<00:01:01.829> these

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
purchase mail-order and purchase these

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
purchase mail-order and purchase these
Scoobies<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Scoobies or you can get one from a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
Scoobies or you can get one from a
friend<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.110> someone<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.949> brewing<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.369> batch<00:01:05.489> of
