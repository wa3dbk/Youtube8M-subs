 I would like to give an example

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.080
 i 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.170
 when I want to favor the defender 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.050

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.690
 the new steps were marked by the buoy 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.640
 for there to be a city there 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.470

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.390
 inside 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.740
 and it can not be presentable when I 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.740
 I'm going to deny him all 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.800
 they were grenades I was ironing that 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.900
