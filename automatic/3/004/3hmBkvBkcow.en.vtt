00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.030 
and it's really cool the difference
between<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.660> first<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.080> second<00:02:28.530> generation

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
between the first and second generation

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.810 
between the first and second generation
is<00:02:29.400> obviously<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> thickness<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.460> second

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
is obviously the thickness on the second

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.560 
is obviously the thickness on the second
generation<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.450> also<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.870> speakers<00:02:35.570> volume

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
generation you also have speakers volume

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.650 
generation you also have speakers volume
control<00:02:36.990> on<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> side<00:02:37.440> right<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.660> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
control on the side right here and you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.540 
control on the side right here and you
have<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.080> little<00:02:40.350> improvement<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.220> speed

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
have a little improvement in like speed

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.190 
have a little improvement in like speed
and<00:02:41.580> stuff<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:42.990> really

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and stuff like that but I don't really

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
and stuff like that but I don't really
find<00:02:43.410> any<00:02:43.800> problem<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:44.280> mine<00:02:44.520> besides

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
find any problem with mine besides

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.790 
find any problem with mine besides
speakers<00:02:46.940> okay<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.150> once<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.900> open<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.350> for

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
speakers okay so once you open it for

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.230 
speakers okay so once you open it for
your<00:02:49.920> first<00:02:50.100> time<00:02:50.340> you're<00:02:50.910> gonna<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.180> to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
different ways you can charge it in your

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.320 
different ways you can charge it in your
computer<00:02:58.740> through<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> USB<00:03:00.530> iPod<00:03:01.530> connector

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330

now and that's really it they need to
know<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.840> charging<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.260> powering<00:03:28.290> up<00:03:28.770> pretty

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
know for charging and powering up pretty

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.650 
know for charging and powering up pretty
simple<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.850> just<00:03:30.030> look<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.240> your<00:03:30.300> battery

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
night when you first open it it won't be

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.420 
night when you first open it it won't be
like<00:03:37.920> mine

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
like mine

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.340 
like mine
it'll<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.970> probably<00:03:39.480> an<00:03:39.570> earth<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
it'll have probably an earth on the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.350 
it'll have probably an earth on the
screen<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.610> might<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.940> configure

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360

so<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.910> your<00:04:21.810> iPod<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.470> will<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.940> four

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
so on your iPod you will have four

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.320 
so on your iPod you will have four
columns<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.720> then<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> dock<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.680> bottom

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
columns and then the dock at the bottom

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.470 
columns and then the dock at the bottom
you

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
you

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.100 
you
and<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.500> hold<00:04:28.800> your<00:04:29.160> finger<00:04:30.030> down<00:04:30.110> they'll

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
and if you hold your finger down they'll

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.780 
and if you hold your finger down they'll
start<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.530> move<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.460> can<00:04:32.610> be

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
start to move and then you can be
