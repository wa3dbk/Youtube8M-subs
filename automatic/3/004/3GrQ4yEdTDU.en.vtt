so<00:03:20.639> not<00:03:20.910> really<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.269> concern<00:03:21.569> anymore<00:03:22.160> we're

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so not really a concern anymore we're

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
so not really a concern anymore we're
going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.859> destructive<00:03:25.859> winds<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.489> to

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
strongest winds we probably won't see

that<00:03:33.569> anymore<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:34.169> is<00:03:34.200> again<00:03:34.980> good<00:03:35.310> news

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
that anymore which is again good news

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.520 
that anymore which is again good news
because<00:03:35.849> of<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.269> system<00:03:36.660> tracking<00:03:36.959> more<00:03:37.290> to

because of the system tracking more to
the<00:03:37.650> west<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:38.400> may<00:03:38.609> turn<00:03:38.819> west<00:03:39.090> north<00:03:39.359> westerly

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the west it may turn west north westerly

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.520 
the west it may turn west north westerly
in<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.169> next<00:03:40.470> few<00:03:41.069> hours<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:42.049> overall<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
in the next few hours but overall the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
in the next few hours but overall the
direct<00:03:44.220> impact<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.970> not<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:46.579> doesn't<00:03:47.579> look<00:03:47.730> so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
direct impact is not a doesn't look so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.580 
direct impact is not a doesn't look so
so<00:03:48.660> likely<00:03:49.319> anymore<00:03:51.109> again<00:03:52.109> it's<00:03:52.260> not<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
so likely anymore again it's not a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.939 
so likely anymore again it's not a
reason<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.299> complacent<00:03:54.840> here<00:03:55.410> as<00:03:55.769> a

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
reason to be to be complacent here as a

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.189 
reason to be to be complacent here as a
system<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:56.699> still<00:03:56.940> pretty<00:03:57.150> powerful<00:03:57.750> even

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199
