there is a way to have learners
independently<00:00:05.879> identify<00:00:06.540> labelled<00:00:06.960> items<00:00:07.410> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
independently identify labelled items in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.339 
independently identify labelled items in
a<00:00:07.740> diagram<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:09.240> slide<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> an<00:00:09.840> example<00:00:10.260> of

a diagram this slide is an example of

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.320 
a diagram this slide is an example of
how<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.559> might<00:00:10.740> work<00:00:10.920> using<00:00:11.639> text<00:00:12.000> entries

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
how that might work using text entries

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.200 
how that might work using text entries
and<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.870> pick<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.320> quiz<00:00:13.620> question<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:15.059> could

I'll<00:01:44.909> change<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:48.500> we'll<00:01:49.500> leave<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
I'll change that and we'll leave the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.050 
I'll change that and we'll leave the
value<00:01:50.130> blank<00:01:52.040> now<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.100> need<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> convert<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
value blank now we need to convert this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
value blank now we need to convert this
to<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.360> free-form<00:01:54.990> quiz<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
to a free-form quiz and the reason is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
to a free-form quiz and the reason is
because<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.119> graded<00:01:57.750> fill<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> blank

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because the graded fill in the blank

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
because the graded fill in the blank
does<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.979> allow<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.670> learners<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.210> type

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
does not allow for the learners to type

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.410 
does not allow for the learners to type
in<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:01.140> than<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.530> answer<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
in more than one answer so what you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.880 
in more than one answer so what you
would<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> insert<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.770> then

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
would do is go to insert and then

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
would do is go to insert and then
convert<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.310> freeform<00:02:05.659> mine<00:02:06.659> says<00:02:06.930> remove

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
convert to freeform mine says remove

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
convert to freeform mine says remove
because<00:02:07.680> I've<00:02:08.069> already<00:02:08.280> done<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.149> save

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
because I've already done that to save

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.570 
because I've already done that to save
time<00:02:09.750> yours<00:02:10.379> could<00:02:10.590> say<00:02:10.739> convert<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> freeform

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
time yours could say convert to freeform

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
time yours could say convert to freeform
you<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.780> want<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> text<00:02:13.290> entry

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you don't want the text entry

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
you don't want the text entry
because<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:14.940> allow<00:02:15.240> for

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
because that also will not allow for

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.630 
because that also will not allow for
more<00:02:15.660> than<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.020> answer<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.550> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
more than one answer but you do want to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.180 
more than one answer but you do want to
pick<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.750> choose<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.920> is

that's<00:02:43.980> done<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.490> triggers<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.209> again<00:02:45.810> I've

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
that's done with triggers and again I've

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.990 
that's done with triggers and again I've

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
started mine to save time but I'll

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.210 
started mine to save time but I'll
double<00:02:48.360> click<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.750> them<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.140> explain<00:02:49.950> what's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
double click on them and explain what's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.699 
double click on them and explain what's
done<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.600> want<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.170> change<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
done so what we want to do is change the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.340 
done so what we want to do is change the
state<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.280> correct<00:02:53.730> box<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.570> selected

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
state of this correct box to selected

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.260 
state of this correct box to selected
when<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.950> happens<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.700> will<00:02:56.820> show<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
when that happens it will show the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.570 
when that happens it will show the
correct<00:02:57.630> layer<00:02:57.870> when<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.860> user<00:02:59.040> clicks<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
correct layer when the user clicks the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.940 
correct layer when the user clicks the
submit<00:02:59.820> button<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.870> only<00:03:01.020> on<00:03:01.230> condition<00:03:01.260> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
submit button but only on condition that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.220 
submit button but only on condition that
they<00:03:02.100> get<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.000> answers<00:03:03.360> correct<00:03:03.600> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
they get all of the answers correct so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.530 
they get all of the answers correct so
we<00:03:04.380> need<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.709> add<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.370> last<00:03:05.700> answer<00:03:06.000> here

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
we need to add in that last answer here

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
we need to add in that last answer here
and<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.790> needs<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.180> equal<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.900> ignore<00:03:10.290> case

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
and it needs to be equal to ignore case

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.010 
and it needs to be equal to ignore case
that<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.160> means<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.550> don't<00:03:11.760> care<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.330> they<00:03:12.959> do

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
that just means we don't care if they do

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.699 
that just means we don't care if they do
upper<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:13.890> lower<00:03:14.250> case<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.470> that's<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
upper or lower case and that's the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.190 
upper or lower case and that's the
correct<00:03:17.040> value<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.540> these<00:03:18.660> need<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.049> be

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
correct value so all of these need to be

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.680 
correct value so all of these need to be
correct<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.459> also<00:03:20.610> need<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> tell<00:03:21.180> story<00:03:21.480> line

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
correct you also need to tell story line

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.570 
correct you also need to tell story line
how<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.959> show<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> incorrect<00:03:22.980> layer<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
how to show the incorrect layer and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.610 
how to show the incorrect layer and
that's<00:03:24.060> by<00:03:24.299> changing<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> state<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
that's by changing the state of the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.280 
that's by changing the state of the
incorrect<00:03:26.220> rectangle<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.090> selected<00:03:27.690> when<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
incorrect rectangle to selected when the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
incorrect rectangle to selected when the
user<00:03:28.470> clicks<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.010> submit<00:03:29.190> button<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:30.269> only

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
user clicks the submit button but only

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.539 
user clicks the submit button but only
on<00:03:30.660> condition<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:31.200> they<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.769> any<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
on condition that they get any of the

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.000 
on condition that they get any of the
answers<00:03:32.700> incorrect<00:03:33.540> notice<00:03:34.230> we're<00:03:34.440> using<00:03:34.590> or
