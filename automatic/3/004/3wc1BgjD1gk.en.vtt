the<00:02:06.420> application<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.349> we<00:02:07.440> need<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
the application that we need to

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.919 
the application that we need to
jailbreak<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> ask<00:02:09.569> us<00:02:09.810> if

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
jailbreak so it's going to ask us if

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.570 
jailbreak so it's going to ask us if
we're<00:02:10.050> jailbreaking<00:02:10.500> an<00:02:10.619> Apple<00:02:10.950> TV<00:02:11.069> today<00:02:11.519> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
we're jailbreaking an Apple TV today so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
we're jailbreaking an Apple TV today so
for<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:11.970> tutorial<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.690> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> say<00:02:13.260> no

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
for this tutorial I'm going to say no

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.199 
for this tutorial I'm going to say no
because<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.129> jailbreaking<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.760> Apple

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
because we are not jailbreaking on Apple

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.180 
because we are not jailbreaking on Apple
TV<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.690> now<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.349> want<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.769> make<00:02:16.890> sure<00:02:16.920> our

are<00:02:22.080> ready<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.440> start<00:02:22.650> jailbreaking<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
look like it's crashing but it will

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.320 
look like it's crashing but it will
crash<00:03:13.959> back<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:14.769> these<00:03:15.310> lines<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.849> code<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.299> you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
crash back to these lines of code as you

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.690 
crash back to these lines of code as you
can<00:03:16.599> see<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.620> all<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.190> code<00:03:18.430> now

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
can see and this is all the code now

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.550 
can see and this is all the code now
this<00:03:18.849> is<00:03:18.909> what<00:03:19.239> we<00:03:19.330> really<00:03:19.540> want<00:03:19.659> now<00:03:20.349> we're

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
this is what we really want now we're

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.680 
this is what we really want now we're
going<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.860> matrix<00:03:21.370> mode<00:03:21.580> here<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.000> do<00:03:22.209> not<00:03:22.390> let

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
going to matrix mode here so do not let

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.240 
going to matrix mode here so do not let
go<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.049> home<00:03:23.230> button<00:03:23.530> until<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.830> see<00:03:24.129> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
go of the home button until you see the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
go of the home button until you see the
Apple<00:03:24.280> logo<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.480> very<00:03:25.720> vital<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.290> keep

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
Apple logo that is very vital so keep

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.670 
Apple logo that is very vital so keep
holding<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.980> home<00:03:27.160> button<00:03:27.190> throughout<00:03:27.849> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
holding the home button throughout this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.530 
holding the home button throughout this
matrix<00:03:29.680> line<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.129> code<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.760> guess<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.390> could

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
matrix line of code I guess you could

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.770 
matrix line of code I guess you could
say<00:03:31.569> ish<00:03:32.220> process<00:03:33.220> because<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.970> will<00:03:34.510> not

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
say ish process because it will not

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.080 
say ish process because it will not
actually<00:03:35.500> continue<00:03:36.190> through<00:03:36.519> unless<00:03:36.910> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
actually continue through unless you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.580 
actually continue through unless you
press<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.480> home<00:03:37.510> button<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:38.079> know<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.410> weird

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
press the home button I know it's weird

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.470 
press the home button I know it's weird
but<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.849> only<00:03:39.879> way<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.390> will

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
but that is the only way it will

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.840 
you will see actually makes an
automatically<00:05:39.230> spring<00:05:39.770> take<00:05:40.040> effect<00:05:40.460> as<00:05:40.670> you

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
automatically spring take effect as you

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.020 
automatically spring take effect as you
guys<00:05:41.000> can<00:05:41.240> see<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:41.720> so<00:05:42.380> after<00:05:43.010> we<00:05:43.040> re<00:05:43.670> spring

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
guys can see and so after we re spring

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.540 
guys can see and so after we re spring

here it is so slide to unlock swipe to

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.990 
here it is so slide to unlock swipe to
the<00:05:54.140> right<00:05:54.170> once<00:05:54.470> open<00:05:54.920> up<00:05:55.040> cydia<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.880> will

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
the right once open up cydia and it will

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.240 
the right once open up cydia and it will
do<00:05:56.120> its<00:05:56.300> initializing<00:05:57.110> filesystem<00:05:57.830> dance<00:05:58.040> so

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
do its initializing filesystem dance so

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.010 
do its initializing filesystem dance so
I<00:05:58.280> somewhat<00:05:58.790> lied<00:05:59.030> about<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.480> sorry

this<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:00.980> last<00:06:01.220> step<00:06:01.460> before<00:06:01.520> we<00:06:01.910> actually

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
this is the last step before we actually

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.930 
this is the last step before we actually
get<00:06:02.420> Cydia<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.990> work<00:06:03.140> fully<00:06:04.040> so<00:06:04.550> this<00:06:04.730> is<00:06:04.850> the

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
get Cydia to work fully so this is the

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.210 
get Cydia to work fully so this is the
initializing<00:06:05.680> filesystem<00:06:06.680> dance<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.040> city

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
initializing filesystem dance the city

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.460 
initializing filesystem dance the city
always<00:06:07.460> does<00:06:07.850> so<00:06:08.600> basically<00:06:08.960> it's<00:06:09.290> basically

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
always does so basically it's basically

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.050 
always does so basically it's basically
downloading<00:06:10.040> all<00:06:10.280> these<00:06:10.430> packages<00:06:10.790> and

downloading all these packages and

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.430 
downloading all these packages and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
call them from the internet is to

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.430 
call them from the internet is to
restring<00:06:14.060> your<00:06:14.210> device<00:06:14.420> applying<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.080> magic
