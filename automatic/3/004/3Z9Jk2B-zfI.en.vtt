starts folding I push with my right hand

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
starts folding I push with my right hand
which<00:02:21.459> is

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
which is

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.559 
which is
out<00:02:21.959> hand<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.590> push<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.120> straighten

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
out hand I push that out to straighten

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.110 
out hand I push that out to straighten
the<00:02:24.600> arms<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.860> cross<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.700> other<00:02:26.850> one

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the arms and to cross the other one

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.860 
the arms and to cross the other one
underneath<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:28.950> kind<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> Lake<00:02:29.520> up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
underneath it so I make kind of Lake up

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.140 
underneath it so I make kind of Lake up
almost<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> t-shape<00:02:31.770> with<00:02:32.040> my<00:02:32.190> arm<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
almost like a t-shape with my arm and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.480 
almost like a t-shape with my arm and
then<00:02:33.360> my<00:02:33.480> knees<00:02:33.750> fold<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> same<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
then my knees fold at the same time and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.820 
then my knees fold at the same time and
I<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.940> loosen<00:02:36.390> up<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.020> right<00:02:37.260> foot<00:02:37.620> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
I have to loosen up the right foot and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.250 
I have to loosen up the right foot and
that<00:02:38.550> tends<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> slide<00:02:39.270> around<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> pedal

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that tends to slide around on the pedal

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.380 
that tends to slide around on the pedal
and<00:02:40.440> sometimes<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.180> bit

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and sometimes it can get a little bit

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.000 
and sometimes it can get a little bit
scary<00:02:42.780> especially<00:02:43.020> when<00:02:43.500> your<00:02:43.650> feet<00:02:43.860> are

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
scary especially when your feet are

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.910 
scary especially when your feet are
moving<00:02:44.190> around<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.300> new<00:02:45.480> position<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.230> at

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
moving around it's a new position and at

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.080 
moving around it's a new position and at
times<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.370> might<00:02:47.520> think<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.880> feet<00:02:48.060> are

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
times you might think your feet are

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.610 
times you might think your feet are
going<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> fly<00:02:48.600> off<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.380> stick

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
going to fly off but you have to stick

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.580 
going to fly off but you have to stick
with<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> combine<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.319> two

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
with it and when you combine the two

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.690 
with it and when you combine the two
together<00:02:52.950> both<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.120> knees<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.260> arms<00:02:55.709> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
together both the knees and the arms it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.810 
together both the knees and the arms it
makes<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> bike<00:02:57.390> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> flip<00:02:58.260> into<00:02:59.220> an

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
makes the bike kind of flip into an

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.810 
makes the bike kind of flip into an
inverted<00:03:00.390> position<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:02.130> took

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
inverted position and then you just took

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.509 
inverted position and then you just took
in<00:03:03.150> more<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.989> make<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.470> bike<00:03:04.769> stick<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
in more just to make that bike stick to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.820 
in more just to make that bike stick to
your<00:03:05.640> body<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.120> feel<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:06.900> feet<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.410> stick<00:03:07.680> to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
your body and feel your feet to stick to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.430 
your body and feel your feet to stick to
the<00:03:07.860> pedals<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:09.180> maximize<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.170> style

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the pedals really maximize on the style

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.350 
the pedals really maximize on the style
of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.800> trick<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.430> how<00:03:11.610> far<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.180> can

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
of the trick and just how far you can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.300 
of the trick and just how far you can
push<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.720> tricks<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.140> its<00:03:13.290> limits<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.190> know

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
push that tricks to its limits you know

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.479 
push that tricks to its limits you know
it's<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.840> me<00:03:16.050> when<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.709> take<00:03:17.040> off<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.400> a

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
it's it's for me when I take off on a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.030 
it's it's for me when I take off on a
vert<00:03:17.670> ramp<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.150> all<00:03:18.420> about<00:03:18.450> leaning<00:03:19.350> with<00:03:19.860> my

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
vert ramp it's all about leaning with my

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.130 
vert ramp it's all about leaning with my
right<00:03:20.280> side<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.420> get<00:03:21.750> my<00:03:21.900> weight

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
right side so I can really get my weight

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.559 
right side so I can really get my weight
almost<00:03:23.069> like<00:03:23.430> I'm<00:03:23.580> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.819> flip<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.360> bike

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
almost like I'm going to flip the bike

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.440 
almost like I'm going to flip the bike
like<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> flare<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:26.280> then<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.519> really<00:03:26.940> push<00:03:27.209> in

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
like a flare but then I really push in

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.509 
like a flare but then I really push in
on<00:03:27.570> my<00:03:27.720> left<00:03:27.959> side<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.440> really<00:03:29.070> tweak<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
on my left side and really tweak that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.789 
on my left side and really tweak that
bike<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.209> bike<00:03:30.450> goes<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.230> wheels<00:03:31.440> point

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
bike so the bike goes the wheels point

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.789 
bike so the bike goes the wheels point
to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.070> roof<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.549> I'm<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.410> inside<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> bike

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
to the roof and I'm all inside the bike

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.100 
to the roof and I'm all inside the bike
and<00:03:35.040> crunched<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.329> left<00:03:36.600> side<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.019> my

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
and crunched up with the left side of my

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.039 
and crunched up with the left side of my
body<00:03:37.140> really<00:03:37.890> pushing<00:03:38.519> down<00:03:39.420> towards<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
body really pushing down towards the
