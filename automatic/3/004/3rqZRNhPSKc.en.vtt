okay<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.140> follow-up<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:02.190> an<00:00:02.520> earlier

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay this is a follow-up to an earlier

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay this is a follow-up to an earlier
video<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.510> did<00:00:03.629> where<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> had<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.100> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
video that I did where I had it on the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
video that I did where I had it on the
spot<00:00:05.759> focus<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.509> had<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> point<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
spot focus and I had the point in the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.470 
spot focus and I had the point in the
wrong<00:00:07.290> place<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:09.030> know<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
wrong place and you know you have to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.629 
wrong place and you know you have to
make<00:00:09.570> sure<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.809> that's<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.349> your<00:00:10.530> face<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.130> put

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
make sure that that's on your face I put

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.200 
make sure that that's on your face I put
it<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> wide<00:00:12.179> area<00:00:12.620> auto<00:00:13.620> focusing<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
it on the wide area auto focusing to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.200 
it on the wide area auto focusing to
test<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.750> if<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.500> will<00:00:16.650> remain<00:00:17.609> locked<00:00:17.940> on

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
test to see if it will remain locked on

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.080 
test to see if it will remain locked on
the<00:00:18.390> face<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.410> program<00:00:19.859> mode<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.580> I'm

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the face and I'm in program mode and I'm

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.560 
the face and I'm in program mode and I'm
at<00:00:21.210> 70<00:00:21.600> millimeter<00:00:22.020> F<00:00:22.230> 2.8<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:24.029> notice

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
at 70 millimeter F 2.8 and so notice

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.320 
at 70 millimeter F 2.8 and so notice
here<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.099> doing<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> pretty<00:00:26.699> good<00:00:26.789> job<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
here this is doing a pretty good job of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
here this is doing a pretty good job of
tracking<00:00:27.930> my<00:00:28.230> face<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.590> getting<00:00:28.769> close<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
tracking my face I'm getting close to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820 
tracking my face I'm getting close to
the<00:00:29.279> camera<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> tracking<00:00:31.500> my

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the camera here and it's tracking my

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
the camera here and it's tracking my
face<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.489> believe<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.239> focus<00:00:33.480> we'll

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
face and I believe that's in focus we'll

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
face and I believe that's in focus we'll
know<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> minute<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> look<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
know in a minute when I look at it on

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.119 
know in a minute when I look at it on
the<00:00:36.239> big<00:00:36.469> computer<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.300> here

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
the big computer but as I go back here

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.619 
the big computer but as I go back here
see<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.520> much<00:00:41.760> further<00:00:42.030> away<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
see here I'm much further away from the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.020 
see here I'm much further away from the
camera<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.860> seems<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.370> tracking<00:00:44.760> my

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
camera and it seems to be tracking my

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
camera and it seems to be tracking my
face<00:00:45.300> fine<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> other<00:00:46.620> side

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
face fine and go over to the other side

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.450 
face fine and go over to the other side
and<00:00:47.899> it<00:00:48.899> seems<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> still<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.680> tracking<00:00:50.129> my

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and it seems to still be tracking my

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.080 
and it seems to still be tracking my
face<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.960> said<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.980> focus<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
face and I said I'm in focus so this is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
face and I said I'm in focus so this is
about<00:00:54.449> I'd<00:00:55.110> say<00:00:55.250> seven<00:00:56.250> eight<00:00:56.460> feet<00:00:56.760> away<00:00:57.000> from

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
about I'd say seven eight feet away from

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700 
about I'd say seven eight feet away from
the<00:00:57.360> camera<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:57.960> again<00:00:58.230> seventy

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the camera right now again seventy

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
the camera right now again seventy
millimeter<00:00:59.100> F<00:00:59.370> 2.8<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> were<00:01:01.559> doing<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
millimeter F 2.8 so if you were doing a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.520 
millimeter F 2.8 so if you were doing a
stand-up<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> had<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.030> people

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
stand-up and you had two people

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.690 
stand-up and you had two people
side-by-side<00:01:04.530> you'd<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.010> probably<00:01:05.519> about

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
side-by-side you'd be probably about

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
side-by-side you'd be probably about
this<00:01:06.090> distance<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> camera<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this distance from the camera if you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.300 
this distance from the camera if you
wanted<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.460> tight<00:01:08.850> shot<00:01:09.619> get<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
wanted a really tight shot get up here I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.969 
wanted a really tight shot get up here I
got<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> thoughts<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
got a thoughts down a little bit and

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.760 
got a thoughts down a little bit and
then<00:01:13.979> you'd<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:15.110> relatively<00:01:16.110> tight<00:01:16.409> shot

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
then you'd have a relatively tight shot

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.999 
then you'd have a relatively tight shot
and<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.270> 70<00:01:18.780> millimeter<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and again I'm at 70 millimeter so this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
and again I'm at 70 millimeter so this
was<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> test<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> subscriber<00:01:21.720> asked

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
was the test that the subscriber asked

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.609 
was the test that the subscriber asked
for<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.619> 70<00:01:23.070> millimeter<00:01:23.490> F<00:01:23.729> 2.8<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
for was 70 millimeter F 2.8 and this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.280 
for was 70 millimeter F 2.8 and this
follow-up<00:01:26.040> test<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.850> showing<00:01:27.600> how<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
follow-up test is showing how well it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740 
follow-up test is showing how well it
tracks<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.159> far<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.270> moving<00:01:30.479> around

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
tracks me as far as as I'm moving around

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.219 
tracks me as far as as I'm moving around
tracks<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.890> face<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.490> focus<00:01:33.000> which<00:01:33.720> again<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
tracks my face on focus which again you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
tracks my face on focus which again you
can't<00:01:34.470> always<00:01:34.650> use<00:01:34.799> manual<00:01:35.130> focus<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.970> mean<00:01:36.210> if

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
can't always use manual focus I mean if

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
can't always use manual focus I mean if
you're<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.259> person<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.130> moving

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you're only one person and you're moving

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.270 
you're only one person and you're moving
around<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.420> shot<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> need<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
around and a shot like this you need it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.130 
around and a shot like this you need it
to<00:01:41.400> track<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> needs<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.630> accurate

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to track you and it needs to be accurate

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.069 
to track you and it needs to be accurate
and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.710> found<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> f<00:01:44.280> C<00:01:44.430> 1000<00:01:45.270> Panasonic

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and I found what the f C 1000 Panasonic

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
and I found what the f C 1000 Panasonic
it<00:01:46.229> does<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.829> some<00:01:47.070> hunting<00:01:47.430> issues<00:01:47.820> when

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it does have some hunting issues when

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.230 
it does have some hunting issues when
when<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.780> doing<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.140> exact<00:01:49.619> same<00:01:49.920> thing

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
when we're doing this exact same thing
