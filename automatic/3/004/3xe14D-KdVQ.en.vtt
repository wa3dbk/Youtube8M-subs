00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.329
 making decisions and putting them into practice is the most important task of the 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.839
 managers and also of any person in their day to day but it is 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.259
 possible to learn to decide 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.609
 in I did see that the view Miguel Angel AriÃ±o and Pablo Maella raise ten 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.800
 principles to achieve optimal decision-making although they warn that a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 correct decision not always according to the text 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930
 to live is to make decisions 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.280
 and making decisions is to live our lives we are shaping it according to the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.210
 decisions 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.670
 we have taken 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 in the professional plane the same thing happens 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.970
 Decision making is the fundamental directive act on the one hand 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.990
 but also 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.060
 the most important personal act 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.710
 yes we do not make decisions 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.290
 in the best of cases what we are doing 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.530
 is leaving control of our lives to third parties 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.470
 many times what happens is that we make decisions because we have 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.230
 to solve some issue 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.690
 we see the situation and we make the decision that seems more reasonable 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.550
 but we do not stop them to think m if we are taking into account all the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.370
 factors or all the things that have to be taken into account 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.270
 there is no regulated education there is no subject in the school 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.810
 cent and in the university where one is taught to make decisions 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.450
 How you learn to walk, how you learn to swim, how you dare 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.040
 to make decisions by making decisions 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.500
 and for that we have distilled ten principles that if one goes 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.940
 following if you do not take them into account will improve your process of making 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 decisions 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 worry to define well more than to guess 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.119
 clearly identify your goals 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.279
 pose your problems realistically 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.829
 he did not play in Welsh it's very easy to do it 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.919
 attends only to the relevant information 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.819
 recognizes uncertainty and managed 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.959
 be creative and generate alternatives 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 but keep in mind that your decisions have consequences 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.389
 what you decide to put into practice 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.249
 I am aware that not everything is rationality 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.770
 The importance 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.069
 is relative 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.149
 the starting point of each person when making decisions 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.949
 for example 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.259
 who is very intuitive 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.230
 when making decisions 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.290
 and I did not think much about whether they are very action-oriented 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.849
 a principle that is probably going to be already going to be especially useful that 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.680
 that clearly identifies your goals percent knows well 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.779
 really what do you want to achieve before making the decision 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:16.809
 but for example 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.029
 another person 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.029
 what is not so intuitive what is more thoughtful 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.649
 well probably a principle that will be more useful to him than he 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.939
 Whatever you decide, only practice 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:30.719
 by whom 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.100
 the decision-making process does not end 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.980
 with making the decision but ends with the application of that decision 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.309
 we in the book say 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.349
 there is no good decision if nobody does something with it 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.289
 another principle that I think is quite important is that of not 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.329
 acted in damages 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.069
 It is very easy to do it 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.129
 and this is because we often have a perception 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.589
 Subjective reality 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.709
 often biased 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.569
 and almost always in our favor 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.249
 we see things as we would like them to be more than what they really are and 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:11.120
 this often makes us make decisions yes 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.830
 know reality well and therefore poor decisions 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.639
 we make decisions because we want to solve situations we want to solve 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.829
 affairs 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.639
 if we do not know well the reality that happens to us many times a cause can 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.639
 of the problem that we intend to solve so we are contemplating 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.759
 no matter how much we say we analyze how much they send, let's see alternatives 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.789
 we will never solve that our problems our situation because no 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.240
 we are contemplating a cause that is the cause of our program therefore 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.800
 know the reality I think is an important advice for managers and 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 for the people 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.830
 we can not know with total certainty seven we have taken a correct system not crazy 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.240
 we can know is if we have followed a few steps because we have followed some principles 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.470
 percent that more or less your home will make it easier have p we have already 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.349
 I decide well 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.709
 but we can always put something out despite taking into account 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.889
 On the other hand, I think it's interesting to highlight 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.860
 that this one and that's something that gets confused a lot that it's not the same to say well 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.189
 the conseller the result has to do with the decision 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.139
 per cent the decision percent and only those aspects intervene 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.970
 about which we can influence 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.710
 but the results of the decision 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.720
 in many times luck influences 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.200
 influence other decisions of other people who are not under our 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.610
 control with which we can be defining well and who we have not 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.870
 achieved what we intended
