tell<00:01:15.540> ya<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> several<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> birds

tell ya there's a several of the birds
here<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> bird<00:01:17.729> show<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:18.240> older<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
here at the bird show are older than the

here at the bird show are older than the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
those bird species and I think there's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
those bird species and I think there's
something<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.200> said<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.100> know

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
something to be said about that you know

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
something to be said about that you know
everyone<00:01:26.610> knows<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.970> birds<00:01:27.530> particularly

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
everyone knows that birds particularly

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
everyone knows that birds particularly
birds<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> prey<00:01:29.100> live<00:01:29.310> quite<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> bit<00:01:29.820> longer<00:01:30.060> at

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
birds of prey live quite a bit longer at

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
birds of prey live quite a bit longer at
a<00:01:30.360> captain<00:01:30.750> situation<00:01:31.350> compared<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> what

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
a captain situation compared to what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
a captain situation compared to what
they<00:01:32.070> live<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> wild<00:01:32.600> but<00:01:33.600> again<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
they live in the wild but again some of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.109 
they live in the wild but again some of
the<00:01:34.860> birds<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.520> older<00:01:35.850> than<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the birds we have are older than the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
the birds we have are older than the
oldest<00:01:36.360> known<00:01:36.509> published<00:01:37.049> lifespans<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
oldest known published lifespans and I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
oldest known published lifespans and I
again<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> says<00:01:39.270> something<00:01:39.299> about

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
again I think that says something about

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.190 
again I think that says something about
having<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.170> purpose<00:01:40.560> working<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> living

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
having a purpose working for a living

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
having a purpose working for a living
not<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.259> staying<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.829> exhibit<00:01:44.280> being<00:01:44.579> able

not just staying on exhibit being able

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
to being able to get out and fly and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.310 
to being able to get out and fly and
work<00:01:47.790> several<00:01:48.090> times<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.540> day<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.049> front
