00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the digital world we have to digivolve

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.480 
the digital world we have to digivolve
so<00:01:04.710> simple<00:01:05.460> digivolution<00:01:06.270> sequence<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.619> so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so simple digivolution sequence go so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
so simple digivolution sequence go so
know<00:01:08.790> josho<00:01:09.150> turns<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.570> gabumon<00:01:09.900> era<00:01:10.650> got

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
know josho turns into gabumon era got

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
know josho turns into gabumon era got
room<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.250> fortunately<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.939> didn't<00:01:12.240> turn<00:01:12.270> out

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
room on fortunately this didn't turn out

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
room on fortunately this didn't turn out
the<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.720> she<00:01:12.990> wanted<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the way that she wanted it to but you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
the way that she wanted it to but you
know<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> her<00:01:15.360> first<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know this is one of her first one so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.999 
know this is one of her first one so
it's<00:01:16.200> okay<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.180> west<00:01:18.180> slope<00:01:18.740> did<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> evolve

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it's okay and west slope did you evolve

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's okay and west slope did you evolve
into<00:01:20.400> diplo<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.840> turned<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.140> really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
into diplo this one turned out really

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
into diplo this one turned out really
cool<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:24.810> at

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
cool as you can see so now we're at

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.660 
cool as you can see so now we're at
champion<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.310> once<00:01:26.520> again<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.150> must<00:01:27.360> digivolve

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
champion so once again we must digivolve

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.380 
champion so once again we must digivolve
even<00:01:29.670> further<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.390> volcano<00:01:31.259> did<00:01:31.439> evolves<00:01:31.860> into

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
even further so volcano did evolves into

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.840 
even further so volcano did evolves into
where<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.600> rivermont<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.350> quedar<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.850 

Greymon<00:01:38.850> digivolve<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.570> metal<00:01:40.170> Greymon<00:01:41.450> so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
Greymon digivolve into metal Greymon so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
Greymon digivolve into metal Greymon so
certain<00:01:43.860> problems<00:01:44.340> always<00:01:44.670> seem<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> arise<00:01:45.540> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
certain problems always seem to arise in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
certain problems always seem to arise in
the<00:01:45.930> digital<00:01:46.049> world<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.210> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the digital world because you know to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.139 
the digital world because you know to
Ultimates<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> handle<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
Ultimates can handle it so we have to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.160 
Ultimates can handle it so we have to
digivolve<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.780> mega<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.479> Darwin<00:01:54.479> oh<00:01:54.659> did<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
digivolve into mega so Darwin oh did you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.980 
digivolve into mega so Darwin oh did you
bulbs<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:56.960> loggia<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:59.420> metal<00:02:00.420> Greymon<00:02:00.780> has

bulbs into loggia and metal Greymon has

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.600 
bulbs into loggia and metal Greymon has
to<00:02:01.170> warp<00:02:01.380> digivolve<00:02:01.560> into<00:02:03.500> la<00:02:04.500> guia<00:02:04.770> good<00:02:05.460> old
