00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
her place this year it was a big step

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.040 
her place this year it was a big step
for<00:02:34.670> us<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.850> get<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.660> were<00:02:35.750> worried<00:02:35.990> about

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
for us to get here we were worried about

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110 
for us to get here we were worried about
even<00:02:36.470> making<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.340> once<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.760> got<00:02:37.910> here

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
even making it here so once we got here

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.080 
even making it here so once we got here
a<00:02:38.990> couple<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> younger<00:02:39.830> guys<00:02:40.090> you're

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
a couple of the younger guys you're

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.250 
a couple of the younger guys you're
apparently<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:41.720> might<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:41.990> been<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.110> bit

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
apparently they might have been a bit

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.140 
apparently they might have been a bit
overwhelmed<00:02:42.860> they<00:02:43.520> feel<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:43.940> didn't

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
overwhelmed they feel they didn't

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.400 
overwhelmed they feel they didn't
perform<00:02:44.300> as<00:02:44.570> well<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.780> they<00:02:44.870> thought<00:02:45.140> they<00:02:45.260> did

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
perform as well as they thought they did

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.350 
perform as well as they thought they did
but<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:46.520> think<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:46.760> did<00:02:46.910> really<00:02:46.940> well<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
but I of all think we did really well I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.260 
but I of all think we did really well I
think<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:49.100> don't<00:02:49.670> want<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> say<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.120> we're<00:02:50.239> a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
think I don't want to say that we're a

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.880 
think I don't want to say that we're a
young<00:02:50.420> team<00:02:50.480> might<00:02:50.810> say<00:02:51.020> we<00:02:51.140> have<00:02:51.290> maybe<00:02:51.620> raced

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
young team might say we have maybe raced

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.160 
young team might say we have maybe raced
enough<00:02:52.160> together<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.760> any<00:02:53.330> upcoming<00:02:53.540> seasons

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
enough together but any upcoming seasons

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.449 
enough together but any upcoming seasons
I<00:02:54.320> think<00:02:54.500> we're<00:02:54.590> gonna<00:02:54.739> do<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.830> lot<00:02:55.010> better<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
I think we're gonna do a lot better and

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490 
I think we're gonna do a lot better and
we<00:02:55.730> got<00:02:55.880> something<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.209> prove<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:57.230> would<00:02:57.410> be

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
we got something to prove this would be

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.350 
we got something to prove this would be
a<00:02:57.530> great<00:02:57.739> experience<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.640> it'll<00:02:59.180> also

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
a great experience for them it'll also

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.479 
a great experience for them it'll also
serve<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.350> well<00:03:00.530> through<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.890> indoor<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
serve them well through the indoor and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.790 
serve them well through the indoor and
outdoor<00:03:01.580> track<00:03:02.030> season<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:03.140> think<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.650> in

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
outdoor track season and I think that in

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.259 
outdoor track season and I think that in
the<00:03:03.890> next<00:03:04.040> two<00:03:04.280> years<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.760> know<00:03:04.880> we'll<00:03:05.090> get

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
the next two years you know we'll get

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.690 
the next two years you know we'll get
one<00:03:05.540> or<00:03:05.660> two<00:03:05.810> more<00:03:05.989> guys<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.590> our<00:03:07.100> depth<00:03:07.489> will

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
one or two more guys and our depth will

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.270 
one or two more guys and our depth will
be<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.239> good<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.920> they'll<00:03:10.160> be

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
be really really good and and they'll be

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.540 
be really really good and and they'll be
they'll<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.820> right<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.150> there<00:03:11.180> again
