00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.730
 this is the blackberry playbook the company does research in motion also 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.260
 Known as there are the creators behind the blackberry smartphones it is 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.380
 the first time open against that come 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.810
 if this technology targets the business market 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510
 and that's what he actually looks like 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.110
 the outside is made a kind of hard rubber and hold both sides well 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.470
 also fed it really can take a beating 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.920
 it is a blessing set 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200
 the resolution of 1024 by 600 and that is a very good protection 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.450
 it is a so-called typing screen 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.280
 that means that the viewing angles are very good, color reproduction is very good 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.140
 but especially this specific type 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 can be put very clearly 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.250
 disappeared other tablet screens is already a lot higher 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.749
 he made useful for that 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.049
 Imagine you are working outside with his leg in the bright sun or wind 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.540
 it busy a lot of lights 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.140
 now it is still good to see what the protector is all about with some smart 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.490
 french of the tablets 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 by making it so difficult to see what is being displayed 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.450
 the term ugly resto bridal flight 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 back from the pack 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.539
 millimeter connection at the top 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.659
 for headphones on the back and a 5 megapixel camera on the front 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.860
 a camera for video calling 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.040
 only see the bottom or a few connections to charge and one 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 micro hdmi output now most on a tv or a big mouth also a touch 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.740
 at the top or you knock 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 two buds arising 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.390
 a separate button 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 for break and clothing can use music application of the four application 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.609
 and this very small thing is the on off button 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.159
 and that found a much larger capacity a very small pot 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.440
 when I hardly get out 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.470
 he must nail you or with good pressure of your things to let you in as well 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.470
 in practice it is actually quite annoying 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.569
 eighty man completely new interface designed it is a completely new 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.899
 operating system 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.049
 they did that I have already mentioned 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.659
 and lots of make you feel use of jazz shirts from movements 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.209
 but not only that the screen itself is touch sensitive 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.219
 also on the stock exchanges 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.140
 the edge around it reacted to touch the penguin 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.669
 and that is actually what esp is based on 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.769
 imagine you want application that you open 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.799
 you start it on the bible 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.239
 drag her up 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.689
 then you get to see it 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.819
 other way around 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.759
 recover the curator as an example settings menu we open utrecht de 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.629
 topside 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.790
 The Chamber of Commerce settings related to dividend adding screen brightness 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.379
 those kind of things 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.069
 you have also been dragged away 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.729
 as in the same jazz share interface that sounds about multitasking 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.849
 the more the programs are open at the same time 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.269
 will be at browser 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.249
 I want to do something else there can be several things 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.969
 if the application now opens again, you will see in small detail which programs 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.329
 be open 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.769
 also one the camera for example 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.189
 then you see the camera and the pause 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.080
 crosses 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.599
 can close 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.529
 also something for the kid 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.480
 if you are after 11 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.739
 is in the program and then swap the cu on the sides and left 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.919
 move to the right 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.649
 if you go left 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.749
 can turn the camera off 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 much more we are using again 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.309
 and when sneaking up again we get the survived 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.129
 and they can take a moment 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.969
 yes close 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.889
 what 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.599
 the new operating system has been able to come for the helicopter 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.879
 designs but it is also a few drawbacks the big drawback is the 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.269
 availability of hertz 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.439
 then you have to come to the elaboration and it is seen that it is important that 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.629
 your applications 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.259
 before the end we will discuss this brand new one on the demonstrators 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.159
 so there aren't that many ers there 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.429
 is available than the world 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.879
 then you can download a new application 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.349
 but the offer is a reasonable card application 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.090
 the we are very interesting the large applications and commonly used applications 

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.779
 who are used to it 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.549
 and then jones that just aren't in it 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.309
 only major erp the popular is not the prophet team 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:27.879
 he is not there or I made it myself for this 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.639
 to tell them 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.469
 This is of course which application is included as you are used to 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:34.610
 talk sales 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.770
 you can view photos that can browser 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.180
 the music player 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.999
 play videos built-in to the camera 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.509
 four play that can be very good and very good processes 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.980
 before that a 1080p material without a shocked one 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.749
 the perfect not play 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.249
 and revolutionary pim to let some little things know as a joke 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.569
 and they take two more games to show 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.770
 that you can already think 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.220
 for example, the large presence here that it was there to communicate with 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.520
 the criminals that does not look standard on it 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.339
 If you want to ruin things you need a couple to your blackberry phone 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.740
 that are not on the catÃ­ there are things like people that can make a context and 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.389
 that only works if a duvet is linked and that it is really on one 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.589
 major drawback 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.319
 well if you already have a blackberry 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.580
 that is not such a problem with linking 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.110
 no blackberry yet 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.590
 it becomes difficult to measure there 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.860
 really certain basic functionality 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.689
 on your tablet 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.189
 They have already let them know that Samos is a Serbia plow 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:38.639
 sync with the blackberry 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.990
 just don't know what to do anymore they are not 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.659
 with the introduction of the 2 0 and that is just a big loss the game 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.339
 the second place a bit of a double feeling behind 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.559
 the hackers group 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.240
 fencers nice he is speed well built after a solid have none of it 

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:57.249
 to notice 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:58.740
 but it's that time again 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.039
 the new operating system 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.259
 it is actually also great see the very nicely worked out tasty randy 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.080
 chesters 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.270
 only the is just a lack of applications and software 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.699
 if you already have a blackberry of course she still has a sink I get some extra 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.219
 functionalities at 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.610
 makes people who are no longer employed, the functionality is very bad 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.919
 limited there are actually another tent on the market not much more offer 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:21.850
 the winter 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.589
 There is a lot of potential 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.080
 but this moment may still be a bit too short 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.080
 to repeat 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.759
 No
