00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
if I read ten books in a month that was

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
if I read ten books in a month that was
great<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.140> only<00:00:49.320> read<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.760> was

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
great if I only read one then that was

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.770 
great if I only read one then that was
good<00:00:51.360> too

good too

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
good too

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
but since I've been making videos I've

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
but since I've been making videos I've
noticed<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> put<00:00:54.539> off<00:00:54.660> longer<00:00:55.020> books<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

much more often because I do set reading

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
incredibly long book I am trying to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.990 
incredibly long book I am trying to
rectify<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.039> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.399> moment<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.789> have<00:01:17.970> been

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
rectify that at the moment I have been

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.499 
rectify that at the moment I have been
reading<00:01:18.470> longer<00:01:19.470> books<00:01:19.729> since<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.910> am<00:01:21.060> having<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
reading longer books since I am having a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
reading longer books since I am having a
little<00:01:21.690> bit<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> extra<00:01:22.080> time<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> moment

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
little bit of extra time at the moment

little bit of extra time at the moment
but<00:01:23.250> book<00:01:23.700> length<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.240> definitely<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:25.140> factor

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
but book length is definitely a factor

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.740

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.889 
do I read short novels and I read some

I<00:02:00.929> hardly<00:02:01.619> ever<00:02:01.800> pick<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.369> short<00:02:02.610> stories<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
I hardly ever pick up short stories and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
I hardly ever pick up short stories and
I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.509> no<00:02:03.780> idea<00:02:04.069> why<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.099> is<00:02:05.550> I<00:02:05.849> do<00:02:05.970> know

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I have no idea why that is I do know

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
I have no idea why that is I do know
that<00:02:06.599> I<00:02:06.660> am<00:02:06.899> slightly<00:02:07.319> picky<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.039> comes

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that I am slightly picky when it comes

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
that I am slightly picky when it comes
to<00:02:08.429> short<00:02:08.640> stories<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.270> sometimes<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to short stories I sometimes think it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
to short stories I sometimes think it
can<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.200> more<00:02:10.410> difficult<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.790> across

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
can be more difficult to get across

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.180 
can be more difficult to get across
everything<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.620> short<00:02:13.860> story

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
everything you want in a short story

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.369 
everything you want in a short story
than<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.849> would<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.510> you're<00:02:15.720> writing<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
than it would be if you're writing a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.240 
than it would be if you're writing a
complete<00:02:16.800> novel<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:18.989> all<00:02:19.170> writers<00:02:19.500> have

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
complete novel so not all writers have

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.380 
complete novel so not all writers have
that<00:02:21.050> succinct<00:02:22.050> skill<00:02:22.560> down<00:02:23.239> but<00:02:24.239> I've

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that succinct skill down but I've

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
that succinct skill down but I've
definitely<00:02:24.599> read<00:02:25.080> amazing<00:02:25.739> short<00:02:25.980> stories<00:02:26.310> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
definitely read amazing short stories I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.369 
definitely read amazing short stories I
mean<00:02:26.580> I'm<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> big<00:02:27.090> Edgar<00:02:27.480> Allan<00:02:27.690> Poe<00:02:27.840> fan<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
mean I'm a big Edgar Allan Poe fan and

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.860 
mean I'm a big Edgar Allan Poe fan and
he<00:02:28.739> wrote<00:02:29.129> almost<00:02:29.819> nothing<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.569> short

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
he wrote almost nothing but short

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
he wrote almost nothing but short
stories<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> poetry<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:32.640> suppose<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.359> we're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
stories and poetry so I suppose if we're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.700 
stories and poetry so I suppose if we're
considering<00:02:33.900> shorts

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
considering shorts

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.510 
considering shorts
into<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> mix<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.670> am<00:02:36.650> definitely<00:02:37.650> more<00:02:37.950> likely

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
into the mix I am definitely more likely

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.090 
into the mix I am definitely more likely
to<00:02:38.880> pick<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.780> novel<00:02:40.260> than<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> am<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> short

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
to pick up a novel than I am a short

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.970 
to pick up a novel than I am a short
story<00:02:41.990> but<00:02:42.990> as<00:02:43.650> far<00:02:43.890> as<00:02:43.920> novel<00:02:44.430> links<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:45.150> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
story but as far as novel links go I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.010 
story but as far as novel links go I
usually<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.310> pick<00:02:47.610> up<00:02:47.760> ones<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.900> are

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
usually like to pick up ones that are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.010 
usually like to pick up ones that are
about<00:02:49.230> two<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> three<00:02:50.190> hundred<00:02:50.400> pages<00:02:51.020> rather

about two to three hundred pages rather

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
than five to 800 pages but I definitely

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.760 
than five to 800 pages but I definitely
admit<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.480> failing<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.140> mine<00:02:58.350> and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
admit that that is a failing of mine and

admit that that is a failing of mine and
one<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.250> am<00:02:59.670> trying<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.780> overcome<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.650> the

one that I am trying to overcome at the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.650 
one that I am trying to overcome at the
moment<00:03:02.160> but<00:03:02.520> I'm<00:03:02.640> definitely<00:03:02.820> interested<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
moment but I'm definitely interested to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.630

have<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.490> preference<00:03:20.760> because<00:03:21.600> some<00:03:22.530> short

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
have a preference because some short

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.470 
have a preference because some short
novels<00:03:23.820> are<00:03:24.540> perfect<00:03:25.350> they<00:03:26.100> are<00:03:26.430> perfect<00:03:27.300> in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480

novels are perfect they are perfect in
their<00:03:27.660> entirety<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.710> everything<00:03:29.520> that

their entirety they have everything that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.320

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
you could ever need or want in a very

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.630 
you could ever need or want in a very
short<00:03:33.660> space<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:33.990> time<00:03:34.170> other<00:03:34.800> novels<00:03:35.250> need

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
short space of time other novels need

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.060 
short space of time other novels need
much<00:03:35.940> longer<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.690> accomplish<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.590> same<00:03:37.620> thing

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
much longer to accomplish the same thing

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.100 
much longer to accomplish the same thing
but<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.580> depends<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.720> writer<00:03:39.930> it

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
but it just depends on the writer it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.780 
but it just depends on the writer it
depends<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.560> story<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.010> depends<00:03:41.700> on

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
depends on the story it just depends on

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.140 
depends on the story it just depends on
the<00:03:41.880> characters<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.620> there<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.940> always

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the characters but there have always

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.600 
the characters but there have always
been<00:03:45.270> moments<00:03:45.630> when<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.710> have<00:03:47.040> been<00:03:47.160> completely

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
been moments when I have been completely

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.000 
been moments when I have been completely
in<00:03:48.030> love<00:03:48.210> with<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.450> book<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.650> might<00:03:49.890> have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
in love with a book and it might have

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.190 
in love with a book and it might have
been<00:03:50.040> 600<00:03:50.700> pages<00:03:50.850> long<00:03:51.210> but<00:03:51.420> when<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.870> get<00:03:52.080> to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
been 600 pages long but when I get to

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.380 
been 600 pages long but when I get to
the<00:03:52.290> end<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.710> wish<00:03:53.010> there<00:03:53.310> were<00:03:53.430> another<00:03:53.640> 600

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the end I wish there were another 600

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.600 
the end I wish there were another 600
pages<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:55.350> me<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> keep<00:03:55.710> going<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.310> just

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
pages for me to keep going and just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.060 
pages for me to keep going and just
spend<00:03:57.120> more<00:03:57.300> time<00:03:57.480> with<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.500> characters<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
spend more time with the characters and

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.810 
spend more time with the characters and
with<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.280> story

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
with the story

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.550 
with the story
I<00:03:59.850> do<00:04:00.090> think<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:00.750> not<00:04:00.870> necessarily<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
I do think that it's not necessarily the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
I do think that it's not necessarily the
case<00:04:01.710> that<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.980> book<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.610> better<00:04:03.150> or<00:04:03.420> worse

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
case that a book can be better or worse

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.240 
case that a book can be better or worse
depending<00:04:04.020> on<00:04:04.350> if<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.650> had<00:04:04.800> more<00:04:05.070> or<00:04:05.100> less

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
depending on if it had more or less

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.340 
depending on if it had more or less
pages<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.270> think<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.050> what<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
pages I just think it's just what the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.050 
pages I just think it's just what the
author<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.860> do<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.310> amount<00:04:08.460> of<00:04:08.580> pages

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
author can do with the amount of pages

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.330 
author can do with the amount of pages
that<00:04:09.270> they<00:04:09.630> end<00:04:09.810> up<00:04:09.900> utilizing<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.710> do<00:04:10.920> quite

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that they end up utilizing I do quite

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.760 
that they end up utilizing I do quite
like<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.820> feeling<00:04:12.240> of<00:04:12.390> being<00:04:12.870> left<00:04:13.320> wanting

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.950 
more I like the feeling of coming to the
end<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.799> book<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.700> wishing<00:04:18.420> I<00:04:18.720> could
