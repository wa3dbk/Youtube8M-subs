they have canola oil in them and then

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
they have canola oil in them and then

they have you know sugar in them and you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.039 
they have you know sugar in them and you
know<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.430> oils<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.240> worse<00:01:30.540> and

know other oils that are worse and
artificial<00:01:31.860> sweeteners<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.759> maybe

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
artificial sweeteners because maybe

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
artificial sweeteners because maybe
they're<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.420> low-calorie<00:01:33.960> salad<00:01:34.560> dressings

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
they're like low-calorie salad dressings
