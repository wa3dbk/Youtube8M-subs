 Indian the Indians you know they put the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.190
 names inspired by nature in 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.990
 the things that surround them for example 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.480
 It has occurred to me that I can be a mountain 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.059
 nevada and you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.230

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.050
 fast scissors I like 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.180
 band we are going to make a great hat 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.600
 Indian chief with lots of feathers 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.450
 colors 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.980
 we need pinocho paper cardboards 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 the pens 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.940
 adhesive tapes 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.820
 with a gift ribbon 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.560
 colourful feathers 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 of stapler and scissors the first thing that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 we will do is mark a line and this line 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.640
 we cut it with scissors 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.510
 we will have to fold it in half 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.510
 panda like that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.110
 and this will be the Indian tomorrow tape 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.570
 decorate it we will do as you like 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.100
 using colored ribbons for example 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.549
 this orange that is very striking 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.530
 and this other green we can also do 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.530
 some small drawings with a marker 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.580
 and now with the colored cards 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.310
 let's make the feathers the first 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.150
 the highest we will fold the cardboard 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.150
 like a fan 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.400
 and we will draw some feathers look panda 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.310
 then we cut it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.280
 to give it a little more realism 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.920
 let's draw the feathers look at a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.330
 central line 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.520
 and some hairlines 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.520
 a central line and roots 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.650
 and now we have to continue doubling the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.489
 cardboard looks small 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.489
 folds like this 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.600
 and we put a little bit of tape 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.080
 band opens this very well and we stick it 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 inside our tape 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.290
 so that when we do not see the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.290
 Scotch tape 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.790
 but now we have to keep putting 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.790
 more pens of other colors 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.519
 yes 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.080
 Y 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.510
 we can also make other pens with 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.900
 different materials for example paper 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.650
 pinocho we superimpose several layers of 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.039
 pinocho paper we fold like that and fold 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.800
 so to be able to cut many feathers to the 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.270
 see panda, how simple is it to do the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.270
 shape of a pen 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.810
 once 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.190
 and so that it has more realism still 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.190
 we make some courts and houses and we want 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:53.160
 ah 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.720
 and finally we are going to put some 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.479
 small colorful feathers let's see 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.250
 bands what color is better 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:03.560
 the orange looks fantastic with a 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.560
 we will hold a little bit of tape 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.289
 two 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.150
 to continue adorning the cap of 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.889
 our great Indian chief 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.129
 let's use gift ribbon 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.709
 we will cut a strip 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:24.459
 that we will record to one of the sides of 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:26.050
 our tape and another on the other side 

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:29.550
 end of the tapes we can hang 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.550
 also some small feathers 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.440
 to see to see what good you have panda you are 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.110
 an authentic Indian chief, since I was made 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.169
 another for me and now only the touch remains 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.120
 final to close it with the measure of our 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.120
 head we can do it with some staples 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.150
 Hey panda that hat is the big boss 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.860
 Indian but we can also do other 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.540
 hats for the rest of the tribe by 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.070
 example if we want to play with friends 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.070
 we have a female version 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.490
 and look with braids to dad we add a 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.069
 little bit of wool and some colored rubber bands 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.360
 and with the same materials we can 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.360
 make us another design 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.590
 but not 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.850
