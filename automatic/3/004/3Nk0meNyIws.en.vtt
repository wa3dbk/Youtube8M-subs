00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
Bill's beat them 27 to nothing I hope

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.240 
Bill's beat them 27 to nothing I hope
the<00:07:12.600> only<00:07:12.750> time<00:07:12.900> I<00:07:12.960> ever<00:07:12.990> shut<00:07:13.470> out<00:07:13.590> Dan<00:07:13.830> Marino

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
the only time I ever shut out Dan Marino

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.580 
the only time I ever shut out Dan Marino
and<00:07:14.850> they<00:07:15.030> believe<00:07:15.600> they<00:07:15.720> piled<00:07:15.990> up<00:07:16.110> over<00:07:16.230> 300

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
and they believe they piled up over 300

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.310 
and they believe they piled up over 300
yards<00:07:17.040> rushing<00:07:17.220> they<00:07:17.580> just<00:07:17.850> pounded<00:07:18.510> they

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
yards rushing they just pounded they

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.800 
yards rushing they just pounded they
just<00:07:19.560> pounded<00:07:19.770> the<00:07:20.130> Dolphins<00:07:20.640> and<00:07:21.330> I<00:07:21.510> think

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
just pounded the Dolphins and I think

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.740 
just pounded the Dolphins and I think
they<00:07:22.010> they<00:07:23.010> kind<00:07:23.340> of<00:07:23.430> put<00:07:23.700> the<00:07:23.820> fear<00:07:24.150> in<00:07:24.360> Miami

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
they they kind of put the fear in Miami

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.510 
they they kind of put the fear in Miami
because<00:07:24.960> I<00:07:25.110> don't<00:07:25.140> think<00:07:25.590> Miami<00:07:25.980> recovered

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
because I don't think Miami recovered

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.690 
because I don't think Miami recovered
from<00:07:26.610> that<00:07:26.790> game
