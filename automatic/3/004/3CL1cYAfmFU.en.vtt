00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
machine gun is that it actually has

machine gun is that it actually has
recoil<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.989> actually<00:00:44.989> has<00:00:45.140> more<00:00:45.170> critical

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
up the recoil it's kind of someone of a

up the recoil it's kind of someone of a
good<00:00:53.480> or<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.690> bad<00:00:53.720> thing<00:00:53.960> depending<00:00:54.290> on<00:00:54.739> how<00:00:54.860> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
good or a bad thing depending on how you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
take it it does give more of a real

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.630 
take it it does give more of a real
realism<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> machine<00:00:59.989> gun<00:01:00.460> but<00:01:01.460> at<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
realism with a machine gun but at the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.190 
realism with a machine gun but at the
same<00:01:01.850> time<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:02.149> will<00:01:02.390> throw<00:01:02.570> your<00:01:02.690> aim<00:01:02.899> off<00:01:05.200> you

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
same time I will throw your aim off you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.929 
same time I will throw your aim off you
know<00:01:06.290> most<00:01:06.439> of<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.710> moderate<00:01:07.280> range<00:01:07.549> machine

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
know most of the moderate range machine

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.370 
know most of the moderate range machine
guns<00:01:08.149> are<00:01:08.270> actually<00:01:08.719> you<00:01:09.049> know<00:01:09.140> really

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
guns are actually you know really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.919 
guns are actually you know really
terrible<00:01:10.009> most<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.490> time<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:11.869> is

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
terrible most of the time this is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.929 
terrible most of the time this is
probably<00:01:12.259> like<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.859> only<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:13.759> that<00:01:13.909> I

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
probably like the only one that I

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.969 
probably like the only one that I
currently<00:01:14.030> know<00:01:14.450> that's<00:01:14.959> somewhat<00:01:15.740> pretty

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
currently know that's somewhat pretty

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.069 
currently know that's somewhat pretty
decent<00:01:16.579> but<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:16.909> will<00:01:17.030> not<00:01:17.209> really<00:01:17.539> have<00:01:17.869> much

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
decent but it will not really have much

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.800 
decent but it will not really have much
of<00:01:18.109> a<00:01:18.319> huge<00:01:18.649> advantage<00:01:19.270> against<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.450> cheeser

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
of a huge advantage against the cheeser

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.730 
of a huge advantage against the cheeser
or<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.799> super<00:01:22.219> cheeser<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.479> lasers<00:01:23.899> so

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
or the super cheeser or the lasers so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.859 
or the super cheeser or the lasers so
again<00:01:25.130> most<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.609> the<00:01:25.759> most<00:01:25.999> popular<00:01:26.450> weapons

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
again most of the most popular weapons

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.019 
again most of the most popular weapons
out<00:01:27.049> there<00:01:27.079> will<00:01:27.920> probably<00:01:28.189> defeat<00:01:28.609> you<00:01:28.789> most

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:29.029 
out there will probably defeat you most

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.929 
out there will probably defeat you most
of<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.240> time<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.979> only<00:01:31.189> advantage<00:01:31.459> with<00:01:31.819> this

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
of the time the only advantage with this

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.669 
of the time the only advantage with this
weapon<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:32.359> that<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:32.569> an<00:01:32.840> all-around<00:01:33.079> type

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
weapon is that it's an all-around type

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.569 
weapon is that it's an all-around type
weapon<00:01:34.189> um<00:01:35.499> because<00:01:36.499> it<00:01:36.679> like<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:37.069> said<00:01:37.310> since

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
weapon um because it like I said since

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.919 
weapon um because it like I said since
it's<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.819> moderate<00:01:38.149> range<00:01:38.359> weapon<00:01:38.779> you'll

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's a moderate range weapon you'll

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.660 
it's a moderate range weapon you'll
never<00:01:39.170> really<00:01:39.380> have<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.799> worry<00:01:40.039> about<00:01:40.189> not

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
never really have to worry about not

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.989 
never really have to worry about not
having<00:01:41.179> enough<00:01:41.240> reach<00:01:42.039> or<00:01:43.039> attacking

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
having enough reach or attacking

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.629 
having enough reach or attacking
multiple<00:01:44.299> people<00:01:44.990> at<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.829> time<00:01:46.159> we're<00:01:46.429> rushing

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
multiple people at a time we're rushing

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.489 
multiple people at a time we're rushing
them<00:01:46.939> with<00:01:47.090> legged<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.749> I<00:01:47.929> guess<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.380> it's

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
them with legged that I guess that it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.529 
them with legged that I guess that it's
highly<00:01:48.799> recommended<00:01:48.829> use<00:01:49.579> legged<00:01:50.060> when<00:01:50.209> using

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
highly recommended use legged when using

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.349 
highly recommended use legged when using
this<00:01:50.630> weapon<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.520> compensate<00:01:52.520> for<00:01:53.209> the

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
this weapon to compensate for the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.679 
this weapon to compensate for the
mid-range<00:01:53.990> moderate<00:01:54.590> range<00:01:54.859> you<00:01:55.520> know<00:01:55.689> for

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
mid-range moderate range you know for

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.959 
mid-range moderate range you know for
the<00:01:56.779> use<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.380> kind<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.770> weapon<00:01:58.130> because

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
the use of this kind of weapon because

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.239 
the use of this kind of weapon because
of<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.749> saying<00:02:00.109> you<00:02:00.200> use<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.499> cheesy<00:02:00.770> you

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
of you saying you use the cheesy you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.219 
of you saying you use the cheesy you
have<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:01.579> be<00:02:01.669> really<00:02:01.969> close<00:02:02.209> but<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:02.810> run<00:02:03.079> out

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
have to be really close but you run out

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.499 
have to be really close but you run out
of<00:02:03.259> bullets<00:02:03.439> really<00:02:03.859> fast<00:02:04.130> if<00:02:04.399> you<00:02:04.489> miss<00:02:04.729> this

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
of bullets really fast if you miss this

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.770 
of bullets really fast if you miss this
weapon<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.889> I<00:02:06.919> said<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.340> more<00:02:07.669> steady<00:02:08.239> much

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
weapon like I said it's more steady much

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.199 
weapon like I said it's more steady much
slower<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.560> doesn't<00:02:10.160> use<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.640> much<00:02:10.759> bullets

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
slower it doesn't use up so much bullets

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.620 
slower it doesn't use up so much bullets
you<00:02:11.569> know<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:13.069> yoga<00:02:13.880> said<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.150> every<00:02:14.390> shot

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
you know so it yoga said in every shot

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.860 
you know so it yoga said in every shot
is<00:02:14.660> more<00:02:15.470> reliable<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:17.060> again<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.570> have<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
is more reliable but again you have to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.240 
is more reliable but again you have to
make<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.350> count

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
make it count

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.980 
make it count
