00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.460
 what an amazing final today I am 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.809
 really enjoyed it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 I think we also have the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.619
 enjoyed it until it was a final 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 for fingers and thumbs of licking 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.029
 yes help for tom dumoulin and rap 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
 seems at a crucial moment 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 Belkin taking the course in the hands 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.519
 extremely hard 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.500
 start cycling for as many as possible 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 to take the lead on Tom Dumoulin 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.910
 but all in all it's about the damage 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 limited and yet have a final 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.430
 got that the apotheosis is like 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.140
 not true wind in a beautiful way 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 Henk how you have experienced the finals 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.680
 I think it did n't work out which 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 completely spotless 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.590
 well look what in a honda from it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.300
 did well 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.149
 well represented with the men who 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 on it you had to sit mollema and the day after tomorrow 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.199
 tÃ¼rk loading boom 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 someone who can say here i looked and the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.930
 arrives week because very early tonk 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 rider arrival have him and several 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 driven times 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 final was next must then you know that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 you have to sit in the front row 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.700
 avoid risks 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 it is what you say yes the tom de combi 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 Molar was the question when it only became 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.580
 drove really fast 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 to my big competitor 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 to get a beautiful fight 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.930
 but others can I say yes those guys 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490
 we did what we had to do 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.720
 to do 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.940
 however in that church there is like that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.500
 in which the sprint year then unfortunately then 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.850
 have to accept that yes me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.990
 I think they did everything 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 have boots that have tried 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 and there should not expect 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 he waved johan times why not me 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 you more about it 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.010
 yes but you also have the cross gates and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030
 she sat with extra men 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.040
 so yeah well let them go a bit 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.080
 then also took to that case where it 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 best represented about for irina 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
 but he was disappointed because he came 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.930
 across the finish and I saw one run out 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.910
 send store of course if you own 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.140
 save the public then you are disappointed as 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.640
 can't finish it 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.010
 Maria can't do bingo every year 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.510
 for him from here but lines 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.640
 I think we really have a great one 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.060
 seen the final that we had to see 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.780
 what was not just belkin and omega 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 pharma quickstep 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 bmc but who also committed 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.149
 done for the win away here 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.770
 to hold 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.620
 so far has tried quincy car 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.920
 has therefore tried on numerous teams 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.510
 were present 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 has tried cannondale but yes it 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.480
 Surely the longest end was yes I did 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.310
 had to try it for the tent 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.780
 postament this year 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.390
 yes you think we are just one 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.909
 preview of the final ranking 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.069
 yes really yes but he a man who 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.069
 explosion with or on the climbs 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.730
 I think even more to luis balloon 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 and therefore must leave also en route 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.590
 take a few seconds once 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.579
 but we also had a lot of viewing later 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.709
 am 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.870
 also thinks in seconds in months 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.220
 basically a second game remains 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.870
 yes but they are so connected 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.450
 daring and I think they are forgotten 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.190
 you through my favorite to double 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.379
 and what I told him the last two days 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 have seen years doing incredible 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.690
 yes that certainly incredible but eeh 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.180
 today too 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.010
 huge hard drive for unwinding and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.750
 I also think that they are deep down 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.470
 arsenal has had to point out 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.010
 wells 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.920
 so today has the time trial today tomorrow 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.810
 is a program but he is today 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.580
 So showing something is my best 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.110
 heart savior 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.300
 do not want to present here 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.140
 but is that also for tomorrow tomorrow the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.640
 the third stage time trial over 9.6 km is that 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.450
 the favorite of both of you 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.220
 Tomorrow I think anyway Tom Dumoulin 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.020
 towering favorite but yes and forget 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 not there are other strong guys in it 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.440
 that is the bat we are expanding 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.970
 have chances were we have one 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.090
 motivated lars tree that is a small one 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.160
 distance season shorter distance than 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.170
 his paul niki terpstra stokebrand for 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.230
 a good performance to put down what 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.730
 you have a long version of longer so he 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.130
 is a wonderful rider who certainly 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.230
 can clean at the top 5 and up to 10 and 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.600
 i think chancellor on the rock and tno 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 decided testing 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.030
 until 3 this morning I want yours 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 heard both say but it is it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.020
 until now morel pin 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.320
 not for lars tree two and niki 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.120
 Terpstra says you can come to me more 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.090
 find 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.700

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.260
 i also like but i like that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.690
 today you have a jacket again 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.410
 done because what he left in the final 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.930
 see that is unprecedented there we have 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.210
 see few brakes and yes 9 km 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.490
 well i also go for and in cool tom and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.040
 also 2 after a chancery only once and 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.220
 then I also put navardauskas three here 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.540
 not in it either and they would be one too 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.540
