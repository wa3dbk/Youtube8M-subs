the economic crisis I think that the
biggest<00:00:27.390> problem<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
biggest problem is that it's not a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
biggest problem is that it's not a
crisis<00:00:29.160> based<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.300> country<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
crisis based on one country but it's a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.000 
crisis based on one country but it's a
crisis<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.840> sort<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> huge<00:00:34.739> problem

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

you know having an income I think it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
you know having an income I think it

things<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.900> important<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
things that that are important and

necessary<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.520> should

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
necessary you know I think we should

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the money that we don't have and I hope

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.499 
the money that we don't have and I hope
that<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> Greek<00:01:18.930> people<00:01:19.250> understand<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that the Greek people understand that it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
that the Greek people understand that it
is<00:01:21.750> important<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:22.979> someone<00:01:23.549> has

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is important that you know someone has

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.179 
is important that you know someone has
to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.210> charge<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.960> sort<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> push<00:01:26.159> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to be in charge and sort of push for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.410 
to be in charge and sort of push for
certain<00:01:26.880> things<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.380> able<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.860> stabilize

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
certain things to be able to stabilize

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
certain things to be able to stabilize
what<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> European<00:01:31.049> Union<00:01:31.380> stands<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
what the European Union stands for and I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
what the European Union stands for and I
think<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> Greek<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.900> act

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
think that the Greek people would act

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
think that the Greek people would act
the<00:01:34.920> same<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> Germans<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.689> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the same way if the Germans would have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
the same way if the Germans would have
the<00:01:37.049> problems<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> Greek<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the problems as the Greek have as a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
the problems as the Greek have as a
German<00:01:39.509> citizen<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.439> important

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
German citizen I think it's important

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.389 
German citizen I think it's important
you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.720> where<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.500> taxes<00:01:44.100> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you know that I know where my taxes go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
you know that I know where my taxes go
and<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.689> important<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.439> know

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and I think it's important to know

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.319 
and I think it's important to know
what's<00:01:47.009> happening<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:47.970> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
what's happening with them I think they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.889 
what's happening with them I think they
that<00:01:49.259> angular<00:01:49.950> market<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.610> doing<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.659> right

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that angular market is doing the right

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.340 
that angular market is doing the right

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
decisions that she makes but I think
it's<00:01:56.610> important<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> she<00:01:57.090> focuses<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.869> the

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
language that they speak ill what is the

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.449 
language that they speak ill what is the
magazine<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:24.019> they're<00:03:24.590> Spiegel<00:03:25.100> they<00:03:25.280> had

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
magazine that they're Spiegel they had

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.160 
magazine that they're Spiegel they had
done<00:03:25.609> this<00:03:25.790> famous<00:03:26.060> cover<00:03:26.389> in<00:03:26.660> Greece<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.079> I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
done this famous cover in Greece and I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.479 
done this famous cover in Greece and I
think<00:03:27.350> that's<00:03:27.530> where<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.950> Greeks<00:03:28.130> got<00:03:28.190> really

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
think that's where the Greeks got really

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.670 
think that's where the Greeks got really
upset<00:03:28.579> with<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:29.540> Greek<00:03:29.810> statue<00:03:30.260> giving<00:03:30.590> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
upset with this Greek statue giving the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.710 
upset with this Greek statue giving the
finger<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.970> think<00:03:32.150> that's<00:03:32.329> where<00:03:32.600> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
finger and I think that's where it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080 
finger and I think that's where it
started<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.650> media<00:03:33.950> war<00:03:34.459> between<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
started all this media war between the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.729 
started all this media war between the
Greek<00:03:35.269> media<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> German<00:03:36.200> media<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.650> think

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
Greek media and the German media I think

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.830 
Greek media and the German media I think
that's<00:03:37.130> always<00:03:37.370> someone<00:03:37.850> who<00:03:37.970> starts<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.569> and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
that's always someone who starts it and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.809 
that's always someone who starts it and
I<00:03:38.930> think<00:03:39.200> there<00:03:39.380> should<00:03:39.530> always<00:03:40.069> be<00:03:40.310> someone

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
I think there should always be someone

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.970 
I think there should always be someone
who<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.030> said<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.420> don't<00:03:41.480> know<00:03:41.690> if<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.380> started

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
who in said I don't know if we started

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.490 
who in said I don't know if we started
it<00:03:43.100> if<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.670> started<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.510> think<00:03:45.019> at<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
it if you started it I think at the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.340 
it if you started it I think at the
moment<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.940> Greek<00:03:47.239> people<00:03:48.079> are

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
moment the the Greek people are

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.050 
moment the the Greek people are
frustrated<00:03:48.620> with<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> situation<00:03:49.940> that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060

they're<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.269> because<00:03:50.600> they<00:03:50.870> know<00:03:50.900> they've

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
they're in because they know they've

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.020 
they're in because they know they've
done<00:03:51.470> something<00:03:51.889> wrong<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.519> mean<00:03:52.880> that's

some stupid things you know now it's

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.379 
some stupid things you know now it's
basically<00:04:13.069> instead<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.430> thinking<00:04:13.910> about<00:04:14.150> it

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
basically instead of thinking about it

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.390 
basically instead of thinking about it
that<00:04:14.540> one<00:04:15.200> nation<00:04:15.560> tries<00:04:15.799> to<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.099> other

well for the European Union you know I

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.300

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
think if if one European country

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.270 
think if if one European country
completely<00:04:32.090> breaks<00:04:32.539> down<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.229> it's<00:04:34.129> a

completely breaks down and it's a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.969 
completely breaks down and it's a
possibility<00:04:34.729> with<00:04:35.150> with<00:04:35.690> Greece<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.379> think

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
possibility with with Greece I think

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.159 
possibility with with Greece I think
every<00:04:37.460> other<00:04:37.639> country<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.330> gonna<00:04:38.539> fall<00:04:38.750> apart
