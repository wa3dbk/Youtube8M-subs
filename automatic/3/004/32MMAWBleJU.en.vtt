00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
stronger and maybe then we can help out

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.490 
stronger and maybe then we can help out
in<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.340> majin<00:05:09.700> buu<00:05:09.850> fight<00:05:10.090> who<00:05:10.750> knows<00:05:10.960> again

there's a lot of ways this can play out
now<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:12.940> course<00:05:13.090> earthling<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.750> would<00:05:13.870> be

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
now of course earthling it would be

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.300 
now of course earthling it would be
insanely<00:05:14.320> hard<00:05:14.590> for<00:05:14.800> your<00:05:14.890> average<00:05:15.160> earthling
