00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
different which would be the unfair I

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.210 
different which would be the unfair I
think<00:03:23.180> by<00:03:23.330> most<00:03:23.600> accounts<00:03:23.770> judging<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:25.069> is

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
think by most accounts judging that is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.040 
think by most accounts judging that is
going<00:03:25.430> on<00:03:25.550> in<00:03:25.610> boxing<00:03:26.060> for<00:03:26.270> many<00:03:26.420> decades<00:03:26.660> that

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
going on in boxing for many decades that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.320 
going on in boxing for many decades that
you<00:03:27.140> can't<00:03:27.380> pin<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.770> one<00:03:27.950> promoter<00:03:28.370> or<00:03:28.670> are

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
you can't pin it on one promoter or are

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.900 
you can't pin it on one promoter or are
one<00:03:29.600> promotion<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.860> we<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.340> all<00:03:31.520> agree<00:03:31.550> I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
one promotion but we can all agree I

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.240 
one promotion but we can all agree I
think<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.630> boxing<00:03:33.020> has<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.380> serious<00:03:33.920> problem

that<00:03:52.130> that's<00:03:52.340> probably<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.739> problem<00:03:54.950> you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
that that's probably the problem you

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.030 
that that's probably the problem you
know<00:03:55.819> it's<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.209> boxing<00:03:57.050> judging<00:03:57.860> is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
subjective sometimes you have a judge

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.020 
subjective sometimes you have a judge
who<00:04:02.480> has<00:04:02.600> personal<00:04:03.260> problems<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.819> not

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030
