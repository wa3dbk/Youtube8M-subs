00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
you see that achievement that's for
killing<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.880> believe<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:22.820> 50<00:01:24.380> unloaded

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
killing I believe it's 50 unloaded

killing I believe it's 50 unloaded
guards<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.580> kill<00:01:26.820> moves<00:01:27.740> okay<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.530> can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
guards what kill moves okay and you can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.140 
guards what kill moves okay and you can
probably<00:01:32.509> play<00:01:33.509> through<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.970> entire

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
probably play through then the entire

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.870 
probably play through then the entire
run<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.290> game<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> probably<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.700> all

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
run of the game you can probably get all

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.880 
run of the game you can probably get all
50<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:40.520> not<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.880> by<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.479> second<00:01:43.320> run

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
50 if not then by your second run

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
50 if not then by your second run
through<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.149> should<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.439> 50<00:01:47.930> unalloyed

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
through you should get the 50 unalloyed

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.620 
through you should get the 50 unalloyed
guard<00:01:49.350> kill<00:01:50.070> moves<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:08.660 

Oh<00:02:00.590> else<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.979> else<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:07.399> wasn't<00:02:08.399> really<00:02:08.550> sure

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
Oh else what else I wasn't really sure

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.160 
Oh else what else I wasn't really sure
if<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.970> wanted<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> guide<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.410> game

be<00:03:07.440> somewhat<00:03:08.190> more<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.150> hassle<00:03:12.889> then<00:03:13.889> if<00:03:14.069> you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
be somewhat more of a hassle then if you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.830 
be somewhat more of a hassle then if you
just<00:03:14.400> stay<00:03:14.609> up<00:03:14.639> here<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.060> just<00:03:15.299> kill<00:03:15.630> them

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
guy for this game mostly because it's a

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.110 
guy for this game mostly because it's a
not<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:28.000> great<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.510> game<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:30.120> looking
