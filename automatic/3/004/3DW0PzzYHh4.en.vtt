00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.760
 this is my left arm tucked inside 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.410
 of the antenna and tucked inside the optimal 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.849
 15 general electric keys 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.490
 We have spoken on the blog 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.800
 about this team of four 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.259
 resonance that came to Spain does not 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.829
 many years and as you can see I'm 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.220
 being object of model doing a little 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.829
 of fear of how it is placed and how it 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.380
 can one do this kind of resonance 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.680
 this type of test I'm going to get up 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.050
 and you are going to see how it is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.150
 how are the antennas both for arms 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.170
 like for legs for members 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.720
 inferior the applications of this 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.200
 General electric stand in this course 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.210
 in this 15th meeting of the asem in 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.989
 marbella has allowed me to do it 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.989
 I have sat here 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 and this is where reclined and accommodating 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.700
 the chair can then be attended to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.640
 patient that template is going to take it out 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 Now that is perfectly set that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 inside the tube of this resonance 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.870
 lizard in 1.5 optimal assonance 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.690
 teslas of general electric this would be 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.590
 as well 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 s 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.539
 to accommodate the other leg in our 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.609
 lower limb since one can 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.829
 enter you can enter here to 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.899
 do the knee resonances of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.420
 ankle joints to be 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.510
 placing our partner of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.710
 Applications 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.729
 for example this would be the antenna of this 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.640
 a small foot a knee a few fingers 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.030
 for example and now let's record 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.030
 having 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.450
 well now let's do the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.009
 knee show stuck in the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.390
 shoe thank god I've never had 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.300
 important knee injury so 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.420
 I have removed my own shoe 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.630
 I have sat down and now I can put 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.120
 [Music] 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.150
 they approach me and position me fairly 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 with my chair 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.209
 and man as they say here as 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 my other leg so I can be more like 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.069
 this super reclining super comfortable and what 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290
 same will do be in this kind of 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.200
 in this team that got into a 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.060
 total resonance whether it's open either 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.220
 closed to be this kind of 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.569
 evidence is not the same of course 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.909
 mind 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.590
 late as I say my lower limb 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.719
 left tucked knee to make 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.469
 this resonance of good articulation 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:59.069
 depends on the position it could be of 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.069
 ankle fingers 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.270
 moving the way you want 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.270
 respectively 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.990
 so many more agents that are going to install 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.580
 seven of the best and nothing 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.020
 I think that is the political horn 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.150
 this approach for school zone 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.750
 of them 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 people 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.620
 active 1.5 islands
