00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
so be well protected by the engine i'll

00:00:44.140 --> 00:01:01.349 
so be well protected by the engine i'll
see<00:00:44.320> if<00:00:44.379> i<00:00:44.469> can<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.769> bottle<00:00:45.070> shot<00:00:55.829> and<00:01:00.359> sort

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
see if i can get a bottle shot and sort

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:09.470 
see if i can get a bottle shot and sort
of<00:01:01.449> hard<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:01.719> see<00:01:02.320> but<00:01:05.670> ok

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
goes with the blinker and then when you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:41.199 
goes with the blinker and then when you
come<00:02:26.860> inside

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.160 

so<00:02:42.209> van<00:02:42.510> help<00:02:47.120> turning<00:02:48.120> signal<00:02:48.540> everything

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
