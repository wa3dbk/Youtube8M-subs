00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 he 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.989
 the bmw i8 is part of this new 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.070
 generation of sportswomen 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.509
 traffic constraints 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 of today at the time when the majority 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.379
 earthlings are also sites help 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.850
 once is not custom we started 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.739
 parked a sportswoman in the city 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.129
 but if there is a model that he 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.409
 deserved 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.329
 it's this real bentley v8 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.579
 incarnation of the future and here I must say 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.290
 how all electric in urban 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.100
 it fits very well and attracts 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.839
 all eyes 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.220
 just a little problem anyway 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.600
 suspensions that are very firm on the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.850
 Milanese cobblestones it beats a little 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.290
 people the 8 is a hybrid sportswoman 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.229
 rechargeable associated with an engine 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.850
 electric 231 horses in the front 110 kg 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.610
 lithium-ion batteries in the center and a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.770
 thermal engine one liter 5 turbo 231 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.350
 horses at the back the whole develops 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 a combined power of 362 horsepower and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.880
 is implanted as not as possible 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.680
 in order to lower the center of gravity 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.780
 limit can thus travel up to 37 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.310
 km in all-electric mode in order to 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.990
 sneaking without greek in the centers 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.970
 states cities a car that can 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.950
 go as well on highway that can 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 go as well in town and you can 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 drive fines and perfect hydra 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.859
 silence with zero emissions 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 it's an extremely versatile car 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.600
 but first it's a real bmw where you 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.979
 can find a driving pleasure and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.579
 driving pleasure in being 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.229
 sports be virtuous side look bmw 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.060
 dared to transcribe almost to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.850
 the identical the style of the concept cars 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.249
 view dynamic sheet and 8 presented 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.799
 in Frankfurt in 2009 and 2011 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.810
 the series d82 seems so straight 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.639
 escaped from a salon the record of the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.039
 proportion of real sports but there 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.600
 add a complex game of color with 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.860
 a contrasting bodywork and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.830
 more keys signature models 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 of dead vecchi it's on the doors in 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.170
 Elytre is for the show 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.610
 but everything else is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.900
 serious look here we had to carbon 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290
 the whole upper part is in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.600
 carbon 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.800
 the floor is aluminum all that 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.050
 to compensate for the weight of the batteries 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.580
 side style is simple they designer bmw 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.480
 have outright broken their days and their 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.510
 nights in the wind tunnel 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 the result a cx of only 0 26 he 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.360
 must be said that they were well helped by 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 carbon fiber that allows for 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.600
 pretty amazing shapes like this channel 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.890
 of airflow really they are 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.110
 let go to check if the civic will be 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.550
 mastered its incredible complexity for 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
 offer a driving pleasure 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.540
 authentic a small winding road 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.760
 overlooking Lake Iseo east of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 Bergamus and the ideal playground for 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.300
 test the interaction between the three 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.060
 motors the electronic drum 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.080
 sophisticated control one launches in short what 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.209
 is going on behind the scenes and a 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.860
 rather mind-blowing complexity but 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 the important thing is the result and I can 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.770
 tell you when driving and ben me I 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.360
 well first amuses me because we have 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.070
 excellent preferences thanks to the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 complementarity between engine 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.010
 and electric motor 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.290
 ap the road behavior is excellent 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.150
 with a very good balance once 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.590
 switch to sport mode the system of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 country is entirely focused on 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560
 maximum performance 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.720
 then they are then stretched like an arc 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.140
 and for stretches do on the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.450
 bends 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.010
 the front end is precise and catchy 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.450
 he comes on the road slightly to the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.790
 go-around at the end of the curve 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.360
 brilliantly demonstrating the quality of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.590
 double fall settings 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.780
 ethics but also the remarkable 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.880
 balance of his high-tech sportsmen 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.310
 honor is so except is it 8 is 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.230
 a real bmw and if it embodies the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.660
 future of sportswomen then the future is 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.490
 radiant especially high fare tickets 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.940
 and some practical aspects 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.940
 neglected
