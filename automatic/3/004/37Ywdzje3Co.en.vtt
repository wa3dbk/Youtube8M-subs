00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.070
 but again a piece of paper to a worker 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.559
 make and there it goes on with kind 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.840
 hides little he was then quite well 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 The child is basically for the first time 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.700
 new things for new projects for things 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.170
 who are still small and will grow 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.170
 as well as the child is also still doing 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.390
 if it is in a question around 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.110
 real children goes then is the child 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.820
 of course the symbol for the child itself 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.440
 It can also be used as a property 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.480
 be meant just when it is near 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.860
 from a person had emerged in the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 Now ask really does not go with children 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.290
 then this person is either someone 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.570
 the childlike is a charming art 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.350
 and therefore someone who 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.510
 unbiased is the world with 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.020
 open eye sees a sometimes 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.610
 can be a bit naive but it can 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.300
 vice versa, it means that there is one 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.790
 Person is the childish is in the sense 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.980
 a four-year-old of the kathi little ones 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.360
 croissant has set up and so behaves 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.409
 So this person too 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.899
 childish stupid snapped shut like 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.350
 just turned four 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.939
 the child in general is 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.109
 if this card really pops up and 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.579
 new things in things that are small and 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.560
 start to thrive so prosper 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.200
 also in projects and the like that is 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.329
 so if you are not right now 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.950
 children are not in the question 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.779
 the map shows the children where you are 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 have to look a bit if they talk 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:41.689
 and the rattles are nearby 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.929
 then you should take care a bit there 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.669
 it's who in the fox the fox 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.979
 we always mirrored ok yes we did 

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:54.020
 just like that 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.939
 fox you stole the goose and that 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.889
 is also the symbolism of the fox where the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.770
 fox is true what's not there is what 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:02.929
 something lazy is maybe even lied 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.090
 or at least not completely 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.179
 given there are untruths there 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.330
 there is something wrong as first clubs 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.340
 for wrong one 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.380
 for things that maybe also so aware 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.780
 be scattered as they are scattered 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.220
 you have to be very careful so 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 when it comes to, for example, in one 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390
 find out how a map 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 thinking person on one or as they 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.840
 there is one opposite or all that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 is meant seriously and the fox dives 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.120
 on then it really looks very 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.700
 Of course that's not difficult 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.020
 against the fox personally just people 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.190
 here are by virtue of their work or 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.390
 We often have something similar to them 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.960
 animals already had at the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.440
 snake a positive relationship but for 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.890
 These cards hold true to this interpretation 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.110
 yes, and then comes the bear and the bear 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.330
 is a real cuddly bear but stands 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.160
 also for strength for sovereignty and for 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
 a certain dominance but not 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.100
 must be proved because such a bear is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.250
 a huge animal that does not have to 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.010
 say extra that 's what's on it yes 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 Sometimes you have a bear but that is 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.000
 really rare the negative property 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 the erb for jealousy stands for 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.970
 someone inside so a bit 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 is immobile and therefore easy 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.390
 jealous of others even though he is 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.220
 not have to 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.620
 sometimes this one would not be known 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.150
 how many actually have it and if 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.670
 that a person has not recognized 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.739
 then sometimes it tends to others 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.440
 Envy to admire or higher 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.980
 Although they have a huge potential 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.180
 has accepted for itself but that is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.920
 really the only thing where the bear 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.100
 a bit ambivalent otherwise 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.660
 stands for it also dominant 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.920
 Personalities he can for bosses 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.300
 he can stand for supervisors 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.120
 or generally for someone the topic 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.130
 dominates when it comes to love 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.260
 but really on the cuddly bear 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.239
 So the man with the broad shoulders 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.880
 It generally a male person card 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.410
 then the man you rely on 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.970
 Maybe there is not the big one 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.320
 yes the type of action is always 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.209
 I'll stay like that, where ever 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.160
 rambazamba is going on but you can 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.239
 to leave and that is now 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.239
 really worth a lot
