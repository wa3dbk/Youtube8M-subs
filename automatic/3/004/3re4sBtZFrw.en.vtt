 hello unbelievable fact today 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.300
 I want to review the topic for you 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.740
 everyone knows how I feel about 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.200
 topics don't like them very much 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.369
 discuss here eternal but skip past 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.320
 this topic I could not pass by 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.099
 it is called s a w ay is 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.289
 interesting name 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.289
 download from repository cedima turnip with 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.149
 she has her belt and you have to sleep and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.009
 track free quick lock screen shred 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.509
 Hyde this kind of Zaleski watch 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.550
 this is done in order not to 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.170
 conflict with the watch shade and so 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.510
 let's see what if represents 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.250
 this topic going into some kind of dialogue 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.760
 where are you and highlighting what 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.980
 message 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.780
 but becomes that orange 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.670
 and even the dialogue itself if 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.380
 highlight or any menu option this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.210
 Looks absolutely like you see it 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.100
 does not interfere with the overall interface 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.680
 it would seem such a red-orange 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.660
 flashy colors can be in seasonally but 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.010
 should somehow not really look like but 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.140
 here everything looks again in common 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.270
 the interface is fine 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.239
 looks fast set but it's easy 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.280
 amazingly I start to stutter look 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.509
 to such amazing beauty 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.240
 really as clear and beautiful 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.280
 selected font icons and even as if 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.490
 you delete some don't know the story 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.109
 Dialogue or number and calls will see already 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.530
 not glass such cues on the button 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.899
 remove 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.609
 and such a matte soft what is very 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.439
 nice to go to watch 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.539
 you see the switches already too 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.789
 slightly changed but already become much 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.100
 cute which also leads not about 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.960
 delight changed of course not only 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.789
 native icons but species have changed 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.069
 each kong of the most popular applications 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.959
 this is shazam chrome and b and so on that 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.759
 also very nice author 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.979
 I think it will generally develop develop 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.719
 it's like i said by clicking on any item 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.420
 all regulators will have orange 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.219
 shades will get used to it by 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.619
 at least i will definitely leave the trip to me 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.149
 happy but let's go let's say no to 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.189
 chrome 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.779
 let's go in the photo and delete it 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.340
 will see the photo how everything looks 

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:57.409
 by the way if you don't like what it looks like 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.300
 transparent status bar in settings 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.850
 winter board it can be removed 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.450
 and so we wanted to delete the photos 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.940
 click delete 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.040
 and after all, too, the button ikonochka remove 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.020
 photos also changed a little bit 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.390
 also very nice to watch google 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.850
 pub message pop up any event 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.160
 social network or calendar no longer 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.410
 such a glass blue instant gray 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.630
 dull again so soft shade that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.500
 also very, very nice to see how 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.630
 lock screen looks like 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.330
 why did we hide the watch so that's nice 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.800
 and gently it appears so let's say 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.810
 we have such a button tip 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 unlock doesn't even bother me 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.430
 what is written are the froids they are friday all 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.740
