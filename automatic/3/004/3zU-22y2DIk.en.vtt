said his goals were to build chemistry

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.509 
said his goals were to build chemistry
evaluate<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> chalice<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.620> push<00:00:11.130> his<00:00:11.280> team's

fitness<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.420> even<00:00:12.780> though<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.080> game<00:00:13.349> ended

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
fitness so even though this game ended

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.060 
fitness so even though this game ended
in<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.980> 0-0<00:00:14.250> draw<00:00:14.549> those<00:00:15.360> goals<00:00:15.630> were<00:00:15.990> met<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.440> do

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
in a 0-0 draw those goals were met I do

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.450 
in a 0-0 draw those goals were met I do
think<00:00:18.230> some<00:00:19.230> heavy<00:00:19.410> legs<00:00:19.710> played<00:00:20.100> into<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
think some heavy legs played into it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.099 
think some heavy legs played into it
today<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.710> 10<00:00:22.710> days<00:00:22.949> into<00:00:23.310> preseason

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
today I think 10 days into preseason

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.279 
today I think 10 days into preseason
played<00:00:25.109> into<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.590> little<00:00:25.890> bit<00:00:26.010> today<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
played into it a little bit today but

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.470 
played into it a little bit today but
it's<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.710> excuse<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.449> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's not excuse for you know what I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's not excuse for you know what I
thought<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> great<00:00:32.309> day

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
thought was you know not not a great day
for<00:00:32.790> us<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.630> only<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.230> many

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for us we only have so many

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.150 
for us we only have so many
opportunities<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:37.160> gel

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
opportunities to get out here and gel

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
opportunities to get out here and gel
and<00:00:39.350> get<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> chemistry<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.250> looking

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and get the chemistry that we're looking

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
and get the chemistry that we're looking
for<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:43.160> it<00:00:44.160> wasn't<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> end<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> world

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
for so it wasn't the end of the world

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.940 
for so it wasn't the end of the world
but<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.440> looking<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> little

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but you know I was looking for a little

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.180 
but you know I was looking for a little
bit<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.079> things<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
bit more so what are the things that you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.119 
bit more so what are the things that you
can<00:00:50.309> take<00:00:50.489> from<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.789> hath<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> build<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
can take from that hath and build on I

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
can take from that hath and build on I
finis<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:54.270> still<00:00:54.480> pushing

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
finis you know we're still pushing

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.639 
finis you know we're still pushing
through<00:00:54.989> fitness<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:58.050> whether<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
through fitness and I do whether it's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.310 
through fitness and I do whether it's
playing<00:00:58.980> quicker<00:00:59.280> whether<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.260> how<00:01:01.260> we

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
playing quicker whether it's how we

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.240 
playing quicker whether it's how we
defend<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> group<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.699> were<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.660> stretched

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
defend as a group we were very stretched

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.620 
defend as a group we were very stretched
there<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.450> can

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
there was a lot a lot of things we can

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
there was a lot a lot of things we can
look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.560> part<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
look at and and that's part of this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
look at and and that's part of this
process<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.360> taking<00:01:09.960> things<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.530> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
process is taking things out that we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.100 
process is taking things out that we
didn't<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> fixing<00:01:12.060> them<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
didn't do well and fixing them and that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
didn't do well and fixing them and that
that's<00:01:13.260> part<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.740> growth<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that's part of this growth so in that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's part of this growth so in that
way<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.710> second<00:01:17.100> half<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.430> go

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
way it's good and the second half we go

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
way it's good and the second half we go
down<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> man<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> gutsy

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
down a man and it was a gutsy

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
down a man and it was a gutsy
performance<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> second<00:01:21.540> crew<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
performance from that second crew so to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.219 
performance from that second crew so to
get<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> tie<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.970> positive<00:01:24.509> did

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
get a tie so that's that's positive did

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.399 
get a tie so that's that's positive did
anyone<00:01:25.680> send<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> today<00:01:27.049> III<00:01:28.049> thought

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
anyone send out to you today III thought

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
anyone send out to you today III thought
Fabien<00:01:28.860> Chris<00:01:29.040> we're<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:30.030> good<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
mobile I thought Sean Franklin had it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
mobile I thought Sean Franklin had it
had<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> good<00:01:35.939> day<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> second<00:01:39.060> half<00:01:39.180> again

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
had a good day in the second half again

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
had a good day in the second half again
it<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.689> more<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> group<00:01:40.229> effort<00:01:40.409> guys

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it was more of a group effort guys

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.940 
it was more of a group effort guys
