00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.969
 nobody matica advises users 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.940
 paint a distance of 15 to 20 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.990
 centimeters in this way will be achieved 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 a couple atomization at a shorter distance 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 increase the speed of the pass and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 greater distance decrease speed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.580
 of the pass in this way will be achieved 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 a perfect surface finish 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.390
 all right 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.370
 to paint a veil adjust the screw 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.710
 of regulation of the needle move away the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.600
 gun the surface and adjust the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.159
 speed of the pass according to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.159
 type of veil you want to achieve 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.519
 why 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.280
 turn the diffuser to atomize in shape 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.100
 vertical for vertical striped pattern 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 or horizontal adjust the vertical diffuser 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.410
 or horizontal as appropriate and adjust 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.110
 the paint distance approximately 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.270
 to 20 centimeters or less and adjust the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.440
 run speed for the formation of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440
 a correct wet layer 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.799
 and 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.780
 no no 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.170
 why 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.830
 for round pattern spraying rotate the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.020
 diffuser at 45 degrees and adjust the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.290
 needle adjustment screw according to 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.290
 the need 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 ah 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.799
 Y 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 why 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 do not 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.570
 Low dispersion demonstration by 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.570
 snow 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.250
 normal 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
 ah 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.270
 cover the exit hole of the cup 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.060
 by number 4 fill the cup with paint 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.300
 to make up the stopwatch on 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.800
 zero and release the exit hole 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.710
 by simultaneously pressing the button of the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.870
 stopwatch observe the output thread of 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.940
 paint and stop the stopwatch in the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.370
 same moment that I said and I do not know 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.740
 first cuts the value of the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.840
 stopwatch will indicate the viscosity of the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.170
 paint in seconds disk for form 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.449
 number 4 from there compare with the 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.120
 table 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.099
 if it has been a few seconds it is 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.469
 because the paint is very liquid 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.309
 therefore add pure paint to the 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:07.270
 mix if they have been many seconds 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.270
 add extender the measure
