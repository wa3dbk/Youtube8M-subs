00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.740
 to mount platelets on a strawberry 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 function of the type of strawberries 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 the platelet fixation system 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.670
 will be different here screw tightening 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.439
 blocking 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:33.949
 here fixing by central screw here 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.949
 corner clamping 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the same way we will find different 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.829
 platelet shapes and dimensions on 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.829
 dismantling 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.870
 we use a tight adapted support 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:03.940
 in the vice the strawberry is placed in this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 support let's get out the wafer 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 but beware of the loosening direction 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.770
 clean the slots of the plates and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 use a torso screwdriver suitable for 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.180
 loosen this type of fastener 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.480
 right here 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.780
 corner clamps came out of the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.780
 booklet 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.580
 editing before any editing of 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.410
 pads check the condition of the strawberry 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.950
 also check the condition of the soup 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:47.620
 the quest set up the platelets 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.620
 and blue that we saw her on the left 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.620
 we do the same for others 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.620
 types of strawberries 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.080
 it is important that the wafer be 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.080
 well supported in his home 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.880
 platelet height control 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.760
 to check the correct assembly of 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.400
 platelets or a deformation of the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.530
 strawberry after a shock 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.940
 we use a support with a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.940
 flat-key comparator 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.180
 the flat shower is positioned on the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.650
 high point of the wafer a defect 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.689
 can come from a bad 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.180
 positioning the wafer of a 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.209
 chips or deformation of the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.120
 strawberry by checking the correct fit and the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.120
 cleanliness often eliminates the defect 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:39.420
 checking again we can say that a 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.930
 maximum default of five hundredths is 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.930
 acceptable
