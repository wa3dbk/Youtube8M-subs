let's<00:01:10.890> start<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.280> Brickyard<00:01:11.820> you'll<00:01:12.720> notice

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
let's start with Brickyard you'll notice

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
let's start with Brickyard you'll notice
a<00:01:13.140> big<00:01:13.320> difference<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:14.100> away<00:01:14.159> between<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a big difference right away between this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
a big difference right away between this
and<00:01:14.880> break<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> serve<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> ball

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and break out see when I serve the ball

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.969 
and break out see when I serve the ball
it<00:01:17.850> goes<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.990> doesn't<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.650> hit

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it goes up and then doesn't actually hit

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.789 
it goes up and then doesn't actually hit
the<00:01:20.009> bricks<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.900> when<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> middle<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the bricks and when I use the middle of

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
the bricks and when I use the middle of
the<00:01:22.860> paddle<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> hit<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> ball<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.119> sort

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the paddle to hit the ball it just sort

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
the paddle to hit the ball it just sort
of<00:01:24.509> bounces<00:01:25.049> softly<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> hit

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
of bounces softly and then when I hit

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.499 
of bounces softly and then when I hit
the<00:01:27.180> edge<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> takes<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.509> these

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the edge then then it takes off these

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
the edge then then it takes off these
are<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.810> favorite<00:01:31.140> things<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.009> game

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
are my favorite things about this game

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
are my favorite things about this game
one<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.329> ball<00:01:33.630> seems<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.409> affected

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
one that the ball seems to be affected

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.210 
one that the ball seems to be affected
by<00:01:34.950> gravity<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.560> paddle<00:01:38.040> can

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
by gravity and to that your paddle can

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
by gravity and to that your paddle can
be<00:01:38.310> used<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> control<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.360> than<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.720> angle

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
be used to control more than just angle

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
be used to control more than just angle
you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> affect<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.030> balls

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you can use it to affect the balls

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
you can use it to affect the balls
velocity<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:43.110> hitting<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> middle<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
velocity by hitting it in the middle to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
velocity by hitting it in the middle to
take<00:01:44.399> take<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:45.000> edge<00:01:45.119> off<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> speed

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
take take a little edge off the speed

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.469 
take take a little edge off the speed
and<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.280> feels<00:01:47.520> great<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and it really feels great I like it a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.039 
and it really feels great I like it a
lot<00:01:48.799> other<00:01:49.799> aspects<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> game<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.479> don't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
lot other aspects about the game I don't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.249 
lot other aspects about the game I don't
really<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.950> much<00:01:53.180> now<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.659> course<00:01:54.720> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
really like as much now of course this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.130 
really like as much now of course this
is<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.500> personal<00:01:56.219> taste<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> fan

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is just personal taste but I'm not a fan

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
is just personal taste but I'm not a fan
of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> color<00:01:58.560> scheme<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.070> used<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
of the color scheme they used for this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
of the color scheme they used for this
game<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.259> easy<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
game it's just not really easy on the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
game it's just not really easy on the
eyes<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.479> let's<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> listen<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
eyes and let's have a listen to the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.510 
eyes and let's have a listen to the
sound

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:27.380 

I<00:02:25.010> guess<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> little<00:02:26.370> beeps<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.120> ball

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
I guess the little beeps when your ball

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
I guess the little beeps when your ball
hits<00:02:27.630> your<00:02:27.810> paddle<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.560> sidewalls<00:02:29.040> are

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
hits your paddle or the sidewalls are

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.940 
hits your paddle or the sidewalls are
okay<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.330> know<00:02:30.450> typical<00:02:30.870> breakout<00:02:31.350> sounds<00:02:31.890> I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
okay you know typical breakout sounds I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.490 
okay you know typical breakout sounds I
guess<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> little<00:02:33.420> noise<00:02:33.720> blasts<00:02:34.290> that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
guess but the little noise blasts that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.430 
guess but the little noise blasts that
happens<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.130> destroy<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> brick<00:02:36.440> really

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
happens when you destroy a brick really

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.370 
happens when you destroy a brick really

number of balls number of players and
difficulty<00:03:34.170> level<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.560> that's<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:36.090> can

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
difficulty level and that's it you can

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.510

choose to have up to 99 balls in the
game<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:39.300> interestingly<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:40.320> will<00:03:40.470> also

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
game but interestingly it will also

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.030 
game but interestingly it will also
accept<00:03:41.160> zero<00:03:41.550> as<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.880> legitimate<00:03:42.600> amount<00:03:43.080> but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
accept zero as a legitimate amount but

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.530 
accept zero as a legitimate amount but
what<00:03:44.160> happens<00:03:44.459> then<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.150> start<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
what happens then is when you start the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.750 
what happens then is when you start the
game<00:03:45.570> after<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.410> draws<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.770> play<00:03:46.950> field<00:03:47.220> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
game after it draws the play field it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
have over the ball I guess the only

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.810 
have over the ball I guess the only
thing<00:04:00.000> i<00:04:00.150> would<00:04:00.209> add<00:04:00.300> there's<00:04:00.830> maybe<00:04:01.830> have<00:04:02.640> the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
thing i would add there's maybe have the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.120 
thing i would add there's maybe have the
ball<00:04:03.000> get<00:04:03.510> faster<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:04.140> never<00:04:04.320> really<00:04:04.560> reaches

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
ball get faster it never really reaches

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.310 
ball get faster it never really reaches
the<00:04:05.160> super<00:04:05.970> high<00:04:06.270> speeds<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.900> breakout

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the super high speeds that breakout

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.250 
the super high speeds that breakout
