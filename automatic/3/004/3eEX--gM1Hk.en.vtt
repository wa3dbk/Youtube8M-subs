on<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> same<00:01:33.450> components

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on it pretty much the same components

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.370 
on it pretty much the same components
that<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.470> showed<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> 2012

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
that I just showed you in the 2012

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.999 
that I just showed you in the 2012
obviously<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> fit<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.770> finish<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
obviously the fit and finish is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.260 
obviously the fit and finish is
different<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> completely<00:01:38.970> different

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
different with the completely different

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.499 
different with the completely different
chassis<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.380> we'll<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:40.920> both<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.509> 2012

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
chassis so we'll have both of the 2012

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.290 
chassis so we'll have both of the 2012
in<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.670> 2010-2011<00:01:44.670> unit<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.000> there

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the supercharger does it build it like

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
the supercharger does it build it like
