the steps to do that another thing how
this<00:00:21.080> works<00:00:22.080> real<00:00:22.320> well<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.620> in<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> body<00:00:23.010> shop

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this works real well is in a body shop

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
this works real well is in a body shop
because<00:00:23.610> that's<00:00:23.760> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.780> where<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
because that's kind of you know where I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.640 
because that's kind of you know where I
use<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> most<00:00:25.950> because<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.730> paint<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.060> car<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
use it most because we paint a car and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
use it most because we paint a car and
sometimes<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.950> overspray<00:00:29.460> gets<00:00:29.700> on<00:00:29.820> some<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
sometimes the overspray gets on some of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240 
sometimes the overspray gets on some of
the<00:00:30.120> pain<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.360> glass<00:00:30.870> or<00:00:31.260> sometimes<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> even

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the pain or glass or sometimes it even

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.889 
the pain or glass or sometimes it even
absorbs<00:00:32.879> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> paper<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> gets<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
absorbs to the paper and gets on the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.470 
absorbs to the paper and gets on the
glass<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:35.039> if<00:00:35.129> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:36.089> ever<00:00:36.210> seen

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480

glass you know if you have ever seen
where<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.890> sunlight<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.789> know<00:00:38.879> when

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
where you see the sunlight you know when

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.319 
where you see the sunlight you know when
you<00:00:39.739> face<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.769> Sun<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.300> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

you face the Sun and kind of have that
fuzzy<00:00:42.899> hegel<00:00:43.379> hazy<00:00:43.800> look<00:00:44.100> through<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.370> glass

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fuzzy hegel hazy look through your glass

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.759 
fuzzy hegel hazy look through your glass
it's<00:00:45.329> probably<00:00:45.690> overspray<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.350> gotten<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
it's probably overspray that's gotten on

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.729 
it's probably overspray that's gotten on
it<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.909> you<00:00:48.839> know<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.019> have<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.469> problem

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
this is an easy step to fix that it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.349 
this is an easy step to fix that it's
what<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.069> clay<00:00:53.370> bar<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.239> is

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
think Mother's 3m I've also used clay

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.509 
think Mother's 3m I've also used clay
magic<00:01:03.539> works<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.929> a<00:01:03.989> while<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.309> always

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
magic works for a while but you always

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.039 
magic works for a while but you always
want<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> keep<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.150> container<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
want to keep it in this container to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
want to keep it in this container to
keep<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> clean<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.159> thing<00:01:08.610> falls

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
keep it clean because this thing falls

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
keep it clean because this thing falls
on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> dirt<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.079> might<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.290> well<00:01:10.380> throw<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
on the dirt you might as well throw it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.719 
on the dirt you might as well throw it
away<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.009> you're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.460> end<00:01:11.610> up

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
away because you're going to end up

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310 
away because you're going to end up
scratching<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.390> paint<00:01:12.600> surfaces<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
scratching your paint surfaces with it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
scratching your paint surfaces with it
because<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.130> dirt<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.520> stick<00:01:14.700> in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because you know dirt will stick in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
because you know dirt will stick in
there<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.149> it<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> turns<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> piece

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
there and it kind of turns into a piece

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
there and it kind of turns into a piece
of<00:01:16.350> sandpaper<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:22.229> you're

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of sandpaper and also you know if you're

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.779 
of sandpaper and also you know if you're
just<00:01:22.590> detailing<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.070> car<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.369> probably

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
just detailing one car you probably

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.149 
just detailing one car you probably
wouldn't<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.200> mix<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> up

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
wouldn't you know you can mix this up

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.779 
wouldn't you know you can mix this up
and<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> clean<00:01:27.119> surface<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.649> you<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
and keep a clean surface but if you you

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.190 
and keep a clean surface but if you you
know<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.509> cleaning<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
glass and overspray I'd probably have

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
glass and overspray I'd probably have
one<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.289> in<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.560> glass<00:01:34.770> and

and<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.650> mix<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:47.010> up<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.370> reuse<00:01:47.730> it<00:01:47.880> as

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and you can mix this up and reuse it as

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.360 
and you can mix this up and reuse it as
many<00:01:48.690> times<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.830> mix<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.100> still<00:01:50.280> have

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
many times as you can mix and still have

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.710 
many times as you can mix and still have
a<00:01:50.430> clean<00:01:50.610> surface<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> start<00:01:51.420> trying<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a clean surface if you start trying to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.590 
a clean surface if you start trying to
mix<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.130> can't<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.330> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
mix it up and and you can't get a a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
mix it up and and you can't get a a
clean<00:01:55.110> surface<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> work<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.160> time<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
clean surface to work with it's time to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:07.370 
clean surface to work with it's time to
throw<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.640> away<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:57.480> get<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.720> another<00:01:57.870> one

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050 

so<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.980> can<00:02:08.070> see<00:02:08.190> I've<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.640> clean

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so you can see I've got the clean

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
so you can see I've got the clean
surface<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
surface there and what this is this is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
surface there and what this is this is
Detailers<00:02:11.820> wax<00:02:12.060> came<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.630> kit<00:02:12.840> i<00:02:13.080> have

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
Detailers wax came with the kit i have

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.350 
Detailers wax came with the kit i have
just<00:02:13.710> used<00:02:13.950> water<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> lubricate<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.030> but

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
just used water to lubricate this but

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.910 
just used water to lubricate this but
this<00:02:15.480> came<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.050> i'm<00:02:16.200> sure<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.440> works<00:02:16.620> well

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
this came with it i'm sure it works well

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.220 
this came with it i'm sure it works well
i<00:02:17.160> will<00:02:18.150> spray<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.020> there

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
i will spray a little bit that on there

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.400 
i will spray a little bit that on there
and<00:02:20.510> start<00:02:21.510> rubbing<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.170> really

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and start rubbing it and it's really

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.350 
and start rubbing it and it's really
rough<00:02:22.770> cuz<00:02:23.040> i<00:02:23.310> don't<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.820> what<00:02:24.000> happened

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
rough cuz i don't know what happened

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.900 
rough cuz i don't know what happened
here<00:02:24.420> how<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.720> got<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
here how that got on there with it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:41.050 
here how that got on there with it
you<00:02:26.910> probably<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.390> hear<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.840> video

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.580 

then<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> starts<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> smooth<00:02:42.930> up<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.350> starts

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
then it starts to smooth up it starts

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.780 
then it starts to smooth up it starts
feeling<00:02:43.740> smoother<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.940> cut<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.270> off<00:02:46.790> if

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
feeling smoother you cut it off if

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.070 
feeling smoother you cut it off if
you're<00:02:47.940> using<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.420> glass<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.930> got

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
you're using this on glass we got

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.970 
you're using this on glass we got
overspray<00:02:49.560> last<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:51.720> get<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.020> wet<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.950> just

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
overspray last just get it wet you just

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.560 
overspray last just get it wet you just
go<00:02:53.310> over<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.670> again<00:02:53.910> you'll<00:02:54.090> kind<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.330> fill

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
go over it and again you'll kind of fill

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
go over it and again you'll kind of fill
that<00:02:54.750> haze<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.500> aren't<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.550> haze<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
that haze that aren't that haze but that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.810 
that haze that aren't that haze but that
uh<00:02:57.350> friction<00:02:58.350> where<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.980> kind<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.160> sticks<00:02:59.520> and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
uh friction where it kind of sticks and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
uh friction where it kind of sticks and
when<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.660> gets<00:03:00.930> real<00:03:01.170> smooth<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
when it gets real smooth I don't have a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.140 
when it gets real smooth I don't have a
restrain<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.090> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
restrain this we just kind of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.670 
restrain this we just kind of
demonstrate<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:04.260> when<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> starts

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
demonstrate it then when it starts

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.190 
demonstrate it then when it starts
moving<00:03:04.950> around<00:03:05.040> real<00:03:05.400> easy<00:03:05.870> you've<00:03:06.870> got<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
moving around real easy you've got it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:22.250 
moving around real easy you've got it
all<00:03:07.320> off<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:12.810> take<00:03:13.080> much<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:14.250> bit

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.500 

but<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.650> take<00:03:23.830> takes<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:24.580> couple<00:03:24.760> minutes<00:03:24.910> go

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
but just take takes a couple minutes go

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.960 
but just take takes a couple minutes go
around<00:03:25.750> all<00:03:25.990> your<00:03:26.170> glass<00:03:26.680> with<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.550> then

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
around all your glass with that and then

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.550 
around all your glass with that and then
you<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.270> use<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.660> know<00:03:28.780> your<00:03:28.930> regular<00:03:29.230> glass

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you can use you know your regular glass

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.380 
you can use you know your regular glass
cleaner<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.010> finish

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
cleaner and finish

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.880 
cleaner and finish
project<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:32.870> anyway<00:03:33.170> works<00:03:33.530> great<00:03:33.860> for

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
project but anyway works great for

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.879 
project but anyway works great for
removing<00:03:34.129> overspray
