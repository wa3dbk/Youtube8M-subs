00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.719
 Kinder transformer here are two 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.269
 testicles 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.369
 drawing here with bambolbi 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.150
 This is who there go optimus shuya in my opinion I 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.920
 I don't remember exactly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 here and 3 more it was in the first release 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 I could not show all three at once 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 different here is very cool that it is impossible 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.129
 Here are different by this but as I understood it in any way 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.710
 does not depend on these pictures here 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 what figures will we find inside here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.160
 let's unpack now this which 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.219
 It was in that issue I bought the most 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.579
 the first two eggs here and here I bought 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.510
 already separately still then with bambolbi 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.070
 so it will be unpacked after 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.930
 march while we look here on this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 hopefully 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.030
 let's start munis replays and in the previous 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.290
 why will I show this at the end 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 Now let's unpack first, so here we are. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.470
 unpacked 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.430
 Now we shoot neatly 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:33.650
 that neatly does not want it turns out not 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:38.450
 very neatly so all shot yes yes 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.700
 Soon the kinzo goes on transform about 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.430
 In general, as it is advertised vkontakte 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.720
 there were five free gifts 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.200
 transformer of the release date, I do in 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.690
 shocked 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.460
 but i think i need to see this one 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.390
 the film still fall my last 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.280
 previous all three parts i saw them 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.280
 opens even there it is written about 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.790
 who is it no more that's interesting yet 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.080
 not crammed right slabs who even bad 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.690
 So here is the main part of 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.180
 they all understood the paintings karting 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.580
 which is all composed in principle here 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.860
 from this circle of different-different colors and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.459
 not all of these circles here and this 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.890
 attached so everything is shorter to this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.600
 little circle okay liner I will not show 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.350
 here is this piece of paper it is standard she 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.769
 damn it at all every time and where it is 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.730
 what is the liner for us is interesting to me 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:48.860
 participant I am collecting all and though 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 no lan let's show here because they 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 such mint as in margo whether there they were 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 dug up at all in three deaths here 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.130
 only one fold Optimus Prime 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.530
 This is Optimus Prime Even I rarely read them 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.360
 looking for she was there sold for money and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 on ebay when something I did not understand exactly 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.269
 Well, here are friends here optimus prime 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.440
 generally cool very cool optimus this 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:22.120
 Optimus Prime as it was going there 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 this is well, as usual, arms and legs 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.110
 hands and legs let's get started again 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.230
 something 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:37.020
 why did not you understand the stop and so now 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:41.770
 now I understand it like this 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:45.220
 a cop here is a handle to our best one 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.920
 Now we will do the second or so 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.820
 better and even better to listen to climbs 4 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.680
 not quite right oh legs are wrong here 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:03.330
 like the previous ones were from the first part 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.290
 Many here, too, here in these are thrust 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.680
 pretty cool did what 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.150
 collect they turn out great that is 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.150
 Custom size around a pancake 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.630
 so what can it do 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.630
 get loose i think okay so right now we 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.550
 tune your legs well so here we are 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.020
 set up legs 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:43.620
 but also body to body here in the middle also 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:47.270
 fixed now about everything 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.440
 all-all-everything wants a curve it's a little stop 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.580
 damn turn on but while turning 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:01.680
 everything is different 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:04.080
 I will turn so curves not crooked and no, not 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.960
 it's crooked here and yes here it should 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.940
 horse all-all is not crooked everything is fine 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.820
 It happened so now we will adjust the legs 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:22.190
 so that it was a pancake here for some reason 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.190
 curve army or not whether you grow by the hand 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.840
 So 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.310
 and that's what she actually says 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.820
 it turned out now I will show you more 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:43.130
 here's our optimus prime 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.979
 here is a little cool for some reason, so 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.830
 here he first let's see now 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.199
 in a closer-closer actually in this as 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.630
 our optimus prime looks 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:58.190
 this is optimus prime guys this to me 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.910
 some kind of side view so back 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:06.320
 as powerful as the leg is a little crooked 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:11.530
 okay other side and that's it 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:14.270
 right and let's go right now I will show 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.930
 figure from the previous release and this 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.080
 by the way girl she has titi here 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.350
 This is Arsen. I read Archie. I later dumped. 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.690
 on the internet this is arsy here and here they are 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.820
 actually look together and yes she is 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.690
 even been to the cinema in my second part I 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.389
 read never watched transformer and 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.430
 forgot a little so i told you that 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.720
 not according to the film most likely it is couples 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.750
 film and TV series over well here 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.880
 it is important how they look here and I think 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.160
 you can finish all thanks put 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.240
 Likely I think you like 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.599
 unpacking kinder 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.599
