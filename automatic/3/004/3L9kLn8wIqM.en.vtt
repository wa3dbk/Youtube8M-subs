00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:11.599
 2 add 2 1 me 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.640
 welcome to my channel 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.280
 today we have a super host that is i 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.989
 boys to those who see how it will be heard and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.210
 then we finally managed to 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.670
 bring it here on our channel after a 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.909
 month of bulls pieces and everything and more 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.379
 to deal with a new topic 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.289
 hot that is coming out of 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.050
 this last update as you have 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.570
 saw they put this new structure 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.579
 defensive the flywheel that has a name of the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.130
 cases of ugly hip aesthetically that 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.470
 however on enough space for the troops 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.940
 aerial is very annoying most real 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.440
 because I've already tried some little ones 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.830
 I attack something and I really see them 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.420
 hot air balloons that sweep away 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.789
 especially if it is placed in front of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.819
 hell towers just can't get over to 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.099
 destroy nothing a casino so I have 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.310
 facts in my opinion they made a stuff 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:31.899
 too much that bothers too much then you don't 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.179
 will succeed flat from the first point because 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.080
 the only thing if maybe like one 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.390
 opponent who puts it enough 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.610
 near hell is succeeded in 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.020
 turn to freeze it all at once 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.429
 and two 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.440
 something you can do for 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.090
 stem this new structure if not it is 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.739
 quite annoying in fact we are that is 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 we would like to talk for a moment you can 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.000
 of attack of the Walloon if with second 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.860
 we can still be an attack 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 effective for three stellar municipalities and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.280
 at 10 or not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 I think it will be more difficult more 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.740
 difficult even for another thing of which 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.390
 we wanted to talk about that is the fact that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.740
 have removed the possibility of using 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.740
 both game modes both ways hicks games 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.570
 and they are not exactly and therefore not 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.510
 can no longer and simulate with one of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.860
 attacks in war and there will be many 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 more files made 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.150
 in fact this I would not like to say 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.360
 to discredit the name of my clan but 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.920
 some of my allies used ismos 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.090
 from the fashions they are seen indeed to 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.830
 difference from a pre war 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.940
 update one after update is there 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.750
 was some more crash yes me 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.600
 personally as I told you before 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.470
 I'm pretty happy I'm happy 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.110
 because in my opinion they ruined a little clash 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.850
 they ruined that taylor thrill not thread 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.720
 that is to say that of me is priceless 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.600
 no, but there are certainly many 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.239
 they used not so much because they wanted to use it 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.760
 but because everyone used it 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.950
 not to be inferior 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.920
 you must always use the thing you are not 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.640
 the usual cat that bites its tail 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.980
 so hopefully if they don't go in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.019
 go for everyone I don't remember 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.489
 what we were doing a couple of months ago 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.590
 struggling to win wars 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.239
 a little because some of us were not yet 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.760
 so good and a little because the others by 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.500
 great the obvious thing if the former fashion that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.690
 he was already thinking of downloading us 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.760
 by everyone in order to be a 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.760
 little bit more competitive because 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.230
 just as you give in the end that is one yes 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.620
 puts it to use it because I use the other too 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:46.239
 try to counter it exactly right 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.120
 Jordanian strangely never is me 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.510
 interested download them because in my opinion 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.280
 ruins already there at the end of the only ones 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.420
 beautiful features gates modena those of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.010
 simulate even more yes I would say that 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.560
 we're getting a little busy with minor 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.810
 nardÃ² precisely on the valon ion then with 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.390
 this new defense becomes more 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.409
 difficult to do it but maybe you do 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.209
 who tried to do something 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.370
 I tried to make some attacks 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.039
 just attacking from the side of the flywheel 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.100
 to see what they did and I have to say 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.109
 that bothers and also hurts them 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.080
 hot air balloons in a while to help because 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.660
 all the hot air balloons always go 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 flywheel assembly that shoots them there 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.289
 they separate and then basically if 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.680
 this is not so much a disaster here 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.180
 the only problem is the fact of the defenses 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.660
 in the air of the hell reader who meanwhile 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.880
 canvases devastate the other thing that second 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.270
 me could be interesting at least 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.150
 in this first month and position them 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.550
 they fly into the weaker side of the village 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.280
 not so much to defend it but because so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.020
 one says no I don't attack that way 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.880
 and meanwhile it is devastated by the other 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.820
 part no this could be one yes 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.650
 in fact he calls what is very skeptical 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.729
 I put it on the side of the village 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.570
 attacked in three with the males from above 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.659
 above this type 3,752 bombs in the country 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.880
 have actually done the omelette 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.080
 the third with 40 was not then arrived 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.080
 made me 50 percent 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.360
 the details tips made can be 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.430
 also studied precisely as you say 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.099
 I strategically put it from one 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.530
 part cosima and I leave few stuff type 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.210
 mine other things yes maybe they say vi 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.889
 I give that heel the other part first 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.310
 from there he scrubs the nice thing is that 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.860
 however it occupies 2x2 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.050
 now I think they will be closed again 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.430
 I get the tips made up to the best that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.469
 I practiced right up to 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.759
 weeks ago always wii congruous now 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.289
 that finally decided that they saw the 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.330
 sides make a mess with the mastiffs 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.080
 put it to stimulate the ass for the ass 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.840
 and you do it on purpose then ie up type 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.000
 no me the same thing i saw yesterday 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.830
 like the walls you can do which 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.099
 I have just finished leading 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.750
 no no no he didn't have everyone happy 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.580
 I was terribly ill with the toga 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.259
 finally the remittance of masses not 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.729
 I knew if the marmi gene flies with the 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.289
 fly to start making me a little bit of mou 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.340
 the random bertero too eager to 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.199
 this immense joy 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.539
 I say okay now point will be 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:25.580
 resigned look tomorrow we start with the 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.580
 his attention by removing even shit 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.949
 yes yes but other thing is that you trust me 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.229
 I'm an engineer I designed 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.300
 upgrade well when you have the 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.210
 village town hall a farming each 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.729
 murder off in theory defenses 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.190
 now they point outward respect 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.400
 at the town hall no then see all the 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.960
 defenses pointing to a part of it 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.349
 type municipio right sense trivedi 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.270
 he practically defended everyone from behind 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.550
 in fact the town hall now I put it 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.409
 below so are all six indeed 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.969
 it is not just this but also any 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.409
 passed only because they made me nervous 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:05.279
 see shoulders between hunting look at me 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.349
 let's make it so good by playing 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.669
 it's nine minutes then if you had to 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.039
 rate this update 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.479
 how much you would give them from 1 to 10 squares 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.430
 I say last year 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.770
 April update had been 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.330
 update of clan wars 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.270
 but what do you think the update there 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:25.300
 that deserves a good 10 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:30.020
 this one from i am generous i give a nice one 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.850
 77 that by now the bones and a half with confidence 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.190
 because then I want to see I'm not 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:39.800
 just curious to see how it is costra 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:43.040
 know at least they did no damage to the 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.510
 more cd status articulated in the honor channel e 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.950
 my 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.420
 other times and from then on we feel 

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:54.020
 let everyone like me 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.670
 finally this beautiful video if you want 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.750
 it's gone from the strings even though I think that 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.210
 now everyone here is family who 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.070
 then say hello see you at 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.640
 next video, hello to everyone, bye 

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.640
 boys
