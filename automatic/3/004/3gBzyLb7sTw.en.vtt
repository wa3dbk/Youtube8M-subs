00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hi how are you all i am mÃ³nica 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.440
 macaque and here we are back with 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.440
 this makeup tutorial 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.840
 this time I could mark my 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 sister the chair to collaborate with her 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.340
 and teach them a makeup option 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 different going very well both 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.270
 brown eyes like green eyes 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.610
 but for green eyes it's something 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.919
 incredible that makes them stand out cane 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.800
 very much let's start with this tutorial 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.980
 I'm going to start by applying carmen in the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.540
 lips 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.540
 so they are very well hydrated 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.160
 I'm going to apply the base in swim bar 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.160
 to the natural environment you see 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
 and blends it with a stephen ross for 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.030
 that you see a much more natural finish and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.030
 more light 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.000
 if you feel your base is a bit dry 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.200
 You can moisten your brush a bit with 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 water of roses 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.580
 I'm going to use my first flesh color 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.580
 the brand next 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.820
 to control or use the suit 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.500
 savannah of the sea that are the deposit in 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.120
 the point where I do not care that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.990
 get darker and then I'll go 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.900
 going down in a blurred way 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.570
 frame a little skin 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.810
 I'm just going to mark the bridge of the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.810
 nose 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.610
 a little chin 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.610
 and the cupid arch 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.130
 so many flashes in this area 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.830
 how do you like your eyebrows more 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.780
 natural and not fill them so much we're going to 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.690
 respect this and I'm only going to 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.220
 brush the eyebrows to remove the excess 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.010
 stuck 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.200
 I will shape my wings 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 I'll start in my eyes by applying the tone 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 coat of the brand lada 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.750
 I'm going to apply it on my mobile eyelid 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 freeing the outer third of my 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.230
 eyelid mobile 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.750
 in the outer third we leave the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.750
 mobile eyelid I will use the white tone 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.980
 taking my brush to blur I'll 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.420
 erase the edges and carry this tone 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 towards my fold and towards my banana 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.280
 his eyelid does not have as much banana 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.110
 both brow bone so it is not 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.819
 I climb the dark so I do not know 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.670
 get all the black and unify with 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.150
 my eyebrows but you see a transition 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.190
 tone and respect the areas with what 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.970
 I'll leave it in the brush 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.020
 to bring to fade towards the golden one if 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.020
 they get fixed I go by all 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.750
 take the pink tone with a brush to 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.700
 apply 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.569
 remember to shake always the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.420
 excess of your pp brushes 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.999
 and with this tone I'm going to do an outline 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.299
 tuxedo guy in my bottom line of 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.299
 track 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.890
 [Music] 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.010
 with this same tone I'm going to upload a 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.379
 little towards my fold 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.299
 so you can see the color transition 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.299
 from the upper eyelid to the lower eyelid 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.289
 Take the skin tone that is a shade of pink 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:26.550
 mate and with a loose hair brush I'll 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.550
 to give light to my web 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.669
 Dear 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.130
 I will now take my illuminator of adhara and 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.230
 a tiny brush I will apply a 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.720
 flash of light on my lacrimal 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.160
 no longer me a little up and a little 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.170
 towards my lower line of tabs 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.150
 I will take my brush again that I use 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.850
 for crease and chocolate tone of 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.700
 adhara with this I will look darken 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.360
 the lower line of tabs in the 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.360
 outside part 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.610
 I'm going to use them in John Penrose tones 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.350
 just to give it a little touch 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.350
 color to my cheeks 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.599
 when the cat 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.660
 I use my lips corrector 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.690
 brand that 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.980
 and I'm going to fill them in this way 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.980
 I'm giving a nude tone 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.620
 The only thing I could add is that you 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.720
 put some black eyeliner on your 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.700
 inner line of tabs to your line of 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.580
 Superior water to make them look more 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.900
 volume and more intense but from there in 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.120
 out of your makeup you can not 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.980
 use is very very easy and take it to 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.630
 cape 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.670
