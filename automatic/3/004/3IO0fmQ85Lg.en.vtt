00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello I am today with 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.429
 alexandra tanguy who creates jewels 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.410
 greedy you will see how to create 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.860
 a roll of liquorice to make 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.349
 a ring 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.809
 then to create a licorice roll 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.460
 from blades of polymer clay you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 will need a little ball of dough 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.310
 black 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 the first step is going to be to heat the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.840
 dough in his hands so that they 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 are easier to model then 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:39.059
 you turn this ball into small 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.739
 rolls stretching the dough the parts 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.820
 to more complicated is to make a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 regular diameter melts the bouzin on 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 stretches regularly by rolling our 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.110
 black pudding 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 then once the son created you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.760
 cut off the ends using a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.760
 knife to make it more regular 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.850
 removing the excess dough that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.729
 leave out 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.369
 so we get a licorice son who 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.369
 you will not have more than rolled up 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.729
 once on licorice rolls 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 realize you will have more than the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.479
 baked 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.729
 so everything depends on the type of dough for 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.369
 this one I spend half an hour at 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.020
 oven at 110 degrees here is the rollers 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 of licorice and now cooked I 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.229
 spent light coat of polish for their 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.470
 shiny man and now I'm going 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.539
 mount remald and now I'm going 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.220
 take the ring stand that I 'm going 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.420
 come and stick to licorice rolls 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.049
 so once the glue has dried well 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.560
 you can flip your ring and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.619
 you get a gourmet ring and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.619
 original
