 of which more than a month and clay three pilots and an important material 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.320
 in all about twenty people determined to study thoroughly this

 behavior of editions during these tests 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.490
 it is a question of testing new solutions especially at the level of the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.560
 torque distribution for the best traction 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.880
 and transmissions which will have to support a surplus of solicitations

 and this parameter must be taken into account for the different settings of the

 car 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.180

 new sculptures capable of improving motor skills 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.220
