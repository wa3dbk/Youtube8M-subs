00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.610
 The position of an accomplished missing first stands the traditional one 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.979
 Carpentry info 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.209
 no matter which wood is used 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.449
 it is planed 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.489
 and then also fine group 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.369
 plane the so-called hydro taut 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.759
 helps our windows to an extremely smooth surface 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.539
 and ensures besides the high quality standard 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 for extremely custom-made finishing 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.369
 Tables for tapping connections of the frame and wings and on it as 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.140
 window 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 Values ​​are executed together with the field machines 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000
 Also here is constantly after the meal 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.970
 to avoid deviations 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.110
 The frame and wing parts fell off the demand and gambled 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 and miss the subsequent machine 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 make a permanent connection of approx 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.470
 made according to this traditional and repeatedly refined genetic engineering 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.080
 and window frames 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.970
 are extremely stable 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.819
 by applying a solidify and then sanding 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.850
 the surface is smoothed 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 and on the subsequent painting 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.710
 in the first step of the Laki process, the frame and also Bocklet - primed 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.150
 a simple process 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.050
 which is significantly improved by the use of special water-based paints 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.920
 Environmental friendliness and longevity of our wood aluminum windows contribution 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.190
 After priming, the window is now ground to the 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
 subsequent discharge unprepared 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 Again, we rely on water-based paints on environmentally friendly 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 Products 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.250
 a perfect environmental balance 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 as well as an excellent indoor climate 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.770
 are the result of this bring 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.500
 All others in the frame will be before assembly 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.620
 fixed by an additional welding point 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.620
 this process helps the frame to even more dimensional stability 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.830
 Wood aluminum windows 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.760
 can be produced in all conceivable forms 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.200
 and can be double glazed or triple glazed 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.320
 The glazing of the window is grouted with high quality silicone 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.789
 Wood aluminum windows are extremely weather resistant 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.839
 and provide the wooden frame for excellent thermal insulation 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.709
 and a pleasant homely character 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.070
 through the superior aluminum shell 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.349
 is one of them 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.599
 even greater choice of features available
