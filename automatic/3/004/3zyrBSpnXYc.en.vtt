00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.920 
trying to open up multiple apps on these
devices<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:21.000> guys<00:00:21.180> these<00:00:21.420> devices<00:00:21.720> are

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
devices so guys these devices are

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050 
devices so guys these devices are
connected<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> same<00:00:23.160> by<00:00:23.340> five<00:00:23.609> because

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
connected with the same by five because

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
connected with the same by five because
some<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.570> apps<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.140> use<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.500> daily

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
some of the apps that we use on daily

basis like Facebook Twitter are related

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
basis like Facebook Twitter are related
to<00:00:28.830> Wi-Fi<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.090> better<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> connect

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
to Wi-Fi and it's better to connect

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
to Wi-Fi and it's better to connect
these<00:00:30.960> devices<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.710> same<00:00:32.009> Wi-Fi<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
these devices with the same Wi-Fi to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.830 
these devices with the same Wi-Fi to
open<00:00:33.480> those<00:00:33.750> apps<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> guys<00:00:36.450> before<00:00:36.660> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
open those apps so guys before we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
open those apps so guys before we
starting<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.410> opening<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> speed

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
starting this opening up a speed

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
starting this opening up a speed
comparison<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.120> check<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.480> whether<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
comparison just check out whether we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
comparison just check out whether we
have<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.500> open<00:00:41.070> app<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.520> these<00:00:41.730> devices

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
have any open app on these devices

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
have any open app on these devices
running<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> background<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
running at the background or not so you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
running at the background or not so you
can<00:00:44.910> witness<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.840> running<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.350> app

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
can witness that I'm not running any app

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.420 
can witness that I'm not running any app
at<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> background<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:48.149> devices<00:00:49.430> first

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
at the background of these devices first

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.369 
at the background of these devices first
of<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.329> phone<00:00:51.809> keypad<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.230> i'm

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of all open up phone keypad so if i'm

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
of all open up phone keypad so if i'm
not<00:00:55.620> wrong<00:00:55.680> i<00:00:56.100> think<00:00:56.129> Iran<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.090> open<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
not wrong i think Iran has open up a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.219 
not wrong i think Iran has open up a
phone<00:00:57.870> keypad<00:00:58.230> before<00:01:00.050> nor<00:01:01.050> three<00:01:02.899> now<00:01:03.899> let's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

and here you can witness that we have

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.370 
and here you can witness that we have
not<00:05:51.060> feel<00:05:51.389> any<00:05:51.630> lag<00:05:52.080> issues<00:05:53.240> however<00:05:54.240> note<00:05:55.110> 3

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
not feel any lag issues however note 3

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.000 
not feel any lag issues however note 3
is<00:05:55.590> little<00:05:56.160> bit<00:05:56.780> faster<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:58.229> opening<00:05:58.590> apps<00:05:58.800> as

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
is little bit faster in opening apps as

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.219 
is little bit faster in opening apps as
compared<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> round<00:05:59.880> but<00:06:00.180> sometimes<00:06:00.720> around

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
compared to round but sometimes around

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.510 
compared to round but sometimes around
is<00:06:01.530> opening<00:06:02.070> apps<00:06:02.250> quicker<00:06:02.850> than<00:06:03.150> note<00:06:03.750> 3<00:06:04.520> so

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
is opening apps quicker than note 3 so

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.180 
is opening apps quicker than note 3 so
