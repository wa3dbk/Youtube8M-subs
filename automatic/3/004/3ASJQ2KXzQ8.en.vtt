a flock because you can take care of it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.069 
a flock because you can take care of it
by<00:00:49.020> being<00:00:49.200> cautious<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> top-heavy<00:00:51.480> he

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
by being cautious but it is top-heavy he

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
by being cautious but it is top-heavy he
almost<00:00:52.410> tipped<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:53.090> when<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.210> setting

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
almost tipped on me when I was setting

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.939 
almost tipped on me when I was setting
him<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> couple<00:00:56.489> spacers<00:00:57.120> here

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
him up so I put a couple spacers here

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
him up so I put a couple spacers here
under<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> base<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.329> base<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.629> amazing<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
under the base the base is amazing I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
under the base the base is amazing I
guess<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.980> start<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> bottom<00:01:02.570> but

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
guess we can start from the bottom but

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.090 
guess we can start from the bottom but
without<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.930> maybe<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> have

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
without that maybe it's because I have

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
without that maybe it's because I have
him<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> spinner<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.689> without<00:01:06.960> those
