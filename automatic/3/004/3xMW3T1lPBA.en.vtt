00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
of music that played over rows and then

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.870 
of music that played over rows and then
it<00:02:24.210> seemed<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.570> work<00:02:24.780> later<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.770> rows<00:02:25.980> same

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
it seemed to work later on for rows same

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.760 
it seemed to work later on for rows same
with<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> Christopher<00:02:27.810> Eccleston<00:02:28.170> music<00:02:28.680> at

with the Christopher Eccleston music at

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.200 
with the Christopher Eccleston music at
the<00:02:28.860> beginning<00:02:28.950> which<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.550> sort<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.880> time

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
the beginning which was a sort of time

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.420 
the beginning which was a sort of time
loyalty<00:02:30.750> thing<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.260> beginning<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.770> music<00:02:32.220> man

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
I suppose a consciously wrote he's been

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.690 
I suppose a consciously wrote he's been
following<00:02:40.500> me<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:41.070> day<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.190> come<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.580> see

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
following me all day then I come to see

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.590

like one for David

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840 
like one for David
ne<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:46.470> maths<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.160> knew<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.700> we

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
ne and then for maths I knew that we

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.250 
ne and then for maths I knew that we
wanted<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.390> mean<00:02:48.510> there's<00:02:48.660> absolutely<00:02:48.750> yes

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
wanted I mean there's absolutely yes

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.470 
wanted I mean there's absolutely yes
where<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.950> maths<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.490> what<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.940> gonna<00:02:51.120> what

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
where is maths then what is gonna what

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.030 
where is maths then what is gonna what
is<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.020> be<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> bit<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.590> defines

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
is that going to be the bit that defines

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.670 
is that going to be the bit that defines
him<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:54.600> was<00:02:54.720> important<00:02:55.260> especially

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
him and that was important especially

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680 
him and that was important especially
with<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> change<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.060> kind<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.390> show

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
with the change of the kind of show

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.690 
with the change of the kind of show
rather<00:02:57.990> than<00:02:58.290> everything<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.040> like

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
rather than everything like that is like

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.030 
rather than everything like that is like
let's<00:03:00.180> make<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.630> as<00:03:00.920> distinctive<00:03:01.920> as

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
let's make this as distinctive as

interpretation<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.910> theme<00:03:12.060> tune<00:03:12.269> I

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
interpretation of the theme tune I

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.530 
interpretation of the theme tune I
wanted<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> make<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> less<00:03:14.340> worse<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:18.269> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
wanted to make it less worse and you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.000 
wanted to make it less worse and you
feel<00:03:18.720> pressure<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.290> every<00:03:19.500> time<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.800> take<00:03:19.950> a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
feel pressure so every time you take a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.110 
feel pressure so every time you take a
stab<00:03:20.310> at<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.459> theme<00:03:20.640> because<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:20.970> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120

did use the word vandalism because I
love<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.920> theme<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.400> wondered<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.360> know<00:03:36.390> how

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
it could be improved and the simple fact

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.960 
it could be improved and the simple fact
of<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:40.050> when<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.730> first

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
of it is that when you know the first

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.690 
of it is that when you know the first
episode<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.540> series<00:03:42.870> 1<00:03:43.290> played<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.280> with

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
episode of series 1 played out with

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.540 
episode of series 1 played out with
Delia's<00:03:45.330> version<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.140> theme<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:47.310> just

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
Delia's version of the theme it just

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.729 
Delia's version of the theme it just
didn't<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:47.970> work<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.470> felt

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
didn't really work in it it just felt

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.660 
didn't really work in it it just felt
like<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.860> needed<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.280> bit<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.459> room<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.830> mean

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
like it needed a bit of room and I mean

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.030 
like it needed a bit of room and I mean
subsequently<00:03:54.420> it's<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.590> had<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.800> bit

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
subsequently it's it's it's had a bit

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.370 
subsequently it's it's it's had a bit
more<00:03:56.220> room
