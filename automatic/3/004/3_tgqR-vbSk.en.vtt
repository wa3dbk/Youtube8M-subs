00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.970
 to travel through new zealand is 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.310
 indispensable to have a coaching either 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.810
 for 15 days if you come as a tourist or if 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.390
 you will be like me several months of 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.640
 backpacker why then because although there 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.349
 public transport does not take you all 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.109
 the corners and it does not give you the same 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.519
 freedom if you have a car like this 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.349
 that has a bed and has everything 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.720
 you need you can stop to sleep in 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.210
 anywhere in the country without worrying 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.609
 for finding a hostel without worrying 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 where to spend the night the freedom that 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.289
 gives you a car like this is immense and it's 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.850
 necessary to cover all 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.530
 kilometers that separate you from a site to 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.090
 another one from new zealand let's take it away 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.000
 Many worries can have your 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.309
 own car and if you're thinking but 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.429
 that's not very expensive to see depends on the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.989
 car can be more or less expensive but what 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.530
 good thing is that once you leave the country 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.269
 you sell it and get your money back so 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 nothing we will see from within what is 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.640
 this to live in 6 square meters 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.970
 but no 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.170
 and you're wondering where I can and 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.659
 where I can not sleep with the car and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 new zealand good unfortunately not 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.420
 you can camp 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.789
 freely anywhere but 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.649
 there are 12 applications for the mobile 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.619
 that will help you find the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.780
 best sites one is wifi camps and the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.420
 another one is called camper mail you have here 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.759
 the two 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 ok this is like the squeeze and the tail 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.790
 cao the nutella and the nocilla and the perfidious 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.860
 cocacola everyone has their preferences 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.200
 and there is no better or worse 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 although the nesquik is better the cocacola 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.280
 the best and nutella of is a thousand times 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 better these two applications are going to 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 show on the map the most 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.729
 nearby for camping showering perform 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.610
 any kind of activity here we have 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.380
 a camping near coromandel and we see 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.970
 that is free starts well has area of 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:07.039
 picnic has a little bit of shade and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:08.450
 we see and eye eye has a library and 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.160
 at night leave the other lit and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.900
 can you connect we can also see 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.610
 comments from other people who were already 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.160
 teeth that you and say for example 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
 that it was clean that maybe there was noise 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.620
 at night it is very close to the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.780
 useful library so it's basic basic 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.459
 basic to have any of these two 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.959
 applications on your mobile if you're going to do 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.290
 traveling through new zealand with the car 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.370
 be it camper mail or wiki camps 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.900
 Normally when you buy the car 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 another backpacker who was here before 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.800
 you usually find everything in the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.050
 car for example I in mine 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.090
 I found a fishing rod that 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.350
 trees one day with robert and we had more 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.850
 shame that glory 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.200
 I also found an adapter to the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.850
 special current to be able to plug 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680
 the laptop and load it whenever 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.200
 want but there is another thing that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.860
 I found and it's not known yet for the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.100
 had the old owner is this 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.540
 a piece of bamboo stick of about two 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.910
 meters fat and robust but did not come with 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.070
 instructions and I do not know why they used it 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.660
 I did not want to throw because I thought maybe 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.480
 the next owner of this car knows 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.550
 what is it for but in nine months I 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.130
 gave time to think several theories theory 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.020
 number one the former owner was very 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.250
 the very partying guas and he liked 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.250
 to dance the limbo 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.360
 theory number 2 the former owner was 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.960
 Olympic vault and pole vault champion 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:39.700
 I did not want to lose the technique and theory 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:47.410
 number 3 the former owner was one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.150
 Jedi knights but berries are all 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.150
 theories and I'll never get to know 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.340
 why did he use this stick so I've 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.010
 searched for my own use and I use it for 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.880
 shower me but it's that you shower with a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.730
 not stick but I use the bamboo cane with the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.560
 solar shower that came with the car this 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.480
 is another invention that comes from wonders 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.920
 and books in the car because when you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.660
 you want to take a shower and you can not find 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.310
 public showers that new zealand there 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.400
 many but maybe you do not always find 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.190
 you can use this you leave it to the sun 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.350
 this side and in about three or four hours 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.760
 It heats up to about 30 degrees 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.639
 ternium has fought me in a week 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 because I had no where to do it maybe not 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.750
 you're wondering if it's cold 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.680
 sleeping in the car to see in summer it 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.880
 it is luxurious in winter heat is not 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.180
 it happens but if you have the plane blanket 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.940
 a comforter 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:47.170
 another blanket 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.170
 and another the lion are deluxe 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.330
 good morning 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.689
 one more morning we get up in the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.449
 car 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.280
 it's cold around here if it does but 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.980
 inside is very good 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.680
 Then comes the worst moment that is 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.030
 get dressed because it's warm and you know 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.210
 that the clothes are out today has been 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.120
 cold and here comes my trick my technique 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.120
 special called the incba clothes 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.390
 It is as easy as picking up the clothes 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.740
 we keep here a little while, you sleep 10 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.880
 more minutes and now that you get up 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.880
 is the warm 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.450
 we've already seen how the site looks for 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.130
 sleep we have seen how to shower we have 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.890
 seen also if it is cold or not 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.140
 It is relative and nothing I leave here below the 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.820
 information the link on how to buy 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.440
