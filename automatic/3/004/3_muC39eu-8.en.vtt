00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.160
 you and I knit a rubber band for our 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.630
 socks 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 15 rows knit 1 front one 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.920
 purse now it's time for us to move on 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.260
 white color how are we going to do it and how 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.260
 we will make this transition here 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.790
 here together the junction we had no ladder 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 for this we start to knit with a string of white 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:04.720
 colors i.e. short tip to oneself 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:11.370
 long put on the palm and just 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.370
 knitting the first loop 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.650
 like this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 ordinary facial loop and further we will 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.509
 a whole row of knit facial 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 now knit this needle and fasten 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:41.759
 white thread at the same time remove the green 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.759
 continue to knit facial 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.710
 pay attention not to loop 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.229
 twisted 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 purl we knit by introducing inside 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.400
 on top of 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.400
 and facial bottom 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.140
 we will knit the first knitting needle 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.050
 fasten the thread for this I am about 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.200
 leave the same distance green 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.200
 threads cut her 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.500
 like this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:45.709
 and I need to thread the green thread 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.069
 neatly since here we had 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.670
 purl loop if we make a bundle 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:58.670
 then he will come out with us on the front side 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:02.890
 product, respectively, take a knitting needle 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.890
 crocheting will even be more convenient 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:20.680
 get comfortable and start the back 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.680
 wall loop like this 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:31.739
 so that our thread was on the wrong side 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:35.000
 side and now we tie a white knot 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.000
 and green thread 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:46.040
 I tie twice and then we 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.209
 thread will fix 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.209
 with a hook 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.879
 now we continue to knit in white 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.879
 face loops 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.670
 we remember that we knit the face 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:13.099
 introducing the needle into the loop from below and purl 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.099
 putting a needle into the loop on top like this 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.500
 when we come to the first spoke on 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.570
 which we have a white thread already knitted 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:54.640
 what we do if we are now 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.510
 knit this first loop and move on 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.640
 second row here we will 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.640
 color step i.e. color transition 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.060
 will be uneven and with a step so here 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.330
 in order to remove this step we 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:17.410
 let's start knitting 2 rows with removal 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:22.440
 first loop but the following is already 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.440
 knit as usual facial 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.100
 we loop only on the second row 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.510
 on the next rows we will knit 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:39.550
 Now I will drive to the end and we will see 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:42.250
 came up to our first loop and the third 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:48.990
 we will knit a row 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.990
 all loops on the needles including the first 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:00.580
 see what happens when you go 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:04.539
 the colors are no longer that explicit and bright 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.650
 steps of course it is a little visible but 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:11.039
 not as much as if we were going 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.560
 just tying first loop 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.229
 besides here we already have three rows here 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.080
 two 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:26.919
 all we need to knit white 5 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:31.150
 rows this third still knit the rest 3 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:34.979
 row 4 5 and we will change the thread exactly 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.979
 the same way on the red thread
