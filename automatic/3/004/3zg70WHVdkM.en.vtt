front Matic keyboard get the MV touch
and<00:00:42.140> not<00:00:42.320> because<00:00:42.589> of<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.769> touchscreen<00:00:43.040> for

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
and not because of the touchscreen for

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.840 
and not because of the touchscreen for
two<00:00:44.360> big<00:00:44.540> reasons<00:00:44.720> one<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.739> env<00:00:46.010> Touch<00:00:46.250> has<00:00:46.610> an

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
two big reasons one the env Touch has an

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.039 
two big reasons one the env Touch has an
800<00:00:47.420> by<00:00:47.540> 480<00:00:47.900> display<00:00:48.710> whereas<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.000> env<00:00:50.330> 3<00:00:50.720> has

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
800 by 480 display whereas the env 3 has

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.210 
800 by 480 display whereas the env 3 has
a<00:00:51.080> 320<00:00:51.979> by<00:00:52.100> 240<00:00:52.339> display<00:00:53.150> so<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:54.949> looks

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
a 320 by 240 display so it just looks

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.359 
a 320 by 240 display so it just looks
the<00:00:55.729> envy<00:00:56.360> touch<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.900> looks<00:00:57.140> nicer<00:00:57.559> I<00:00:57.769> mean

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
the envy touch just looks nicer I mean

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:59.649 
the envy touch just looks nicer I mean
no<00:00:58.460> matter<00:00:58.610> what<00:00:58.729> you're<00:00:59.000> doing<00:00:59.119> it<00:00:59.479> just

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
no matter what you're doing it just

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.620 
no matter what you're doing it just
looks<00:00:59.869> better<00:01:00.080> I'll<00:01:01.040> load<00:01:01.250> up<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.460> webpage<00:01:01.699> here

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.050 

second<00:01:05.630> reason<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:06.080> because<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.250> env<00:01:07.729> Touch

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
second reason is because the env Touch

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.660 
second reason is because the env Touch
has<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> real<00:01:08.689> headphone<00:01:09.260> jack<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.490> do

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
has a real headphone jack so if you do

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.240 
has a real headphone jack so if you do
want<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.940> use<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.240> as<00:01:11.360> a<00:01:11.390> music<00:01:11.780> player<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:13.100> can

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
want to use it as a music player you can

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.890 
want to use it as a music player you can
just<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.730> know<00:01:13.760> get<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:14.240> into<00:01:14.660> your

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
just you know get right into your

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.540 
just you know get right into your
headphones<00:01:15.350> or<00:01:15.620> plug<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.860> into<00:01:15.980> your<00:01:16.130> car

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
headphones or plug it into your car

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.230 
headphones or plug it into your car
stereo<00:01:16.820> or<00:01:17.150> home<00:01:17.270> speakers<00:01:17.660> or<00:01:17.780> whatever<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
stereo or home speakers or whatever the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.970 
stereo or home speakers or whatever the
env3<00:01:20.270> has<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.870> two<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> half<00:01:21.470> millimeter

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
env3 has a two and a half millimeter

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.200 
env3 has a two and a half millimeter
jack<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.490> you'll<00:01:22.610> have<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.820> get<00:01:22.940> an<00:01:23.000> adapter

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
jack so you'll have to get an adapter

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.740 
jack so you'll have to get an adapter
which<00:01:24.110> isn't<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.560> big<00:01:24.980> of<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.190> deal<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:25.430> guess

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
which isn't that big of a deal I guess

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.850 
which isn't that big of a deal I guess
but<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.260> know<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:27.560> you're<00:01:27.680> buying

know<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.610> big<00:02:58.819> enough<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.360> again<00:02:59.600> just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
know it's it's big enough but again just

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.990 
know it's it's big enough but again just
for<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> money<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.980> step<00:03:01.250> up<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.700> envy

nicer<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.040> then<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.519> do<00:03:04.640> get<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.940> touch

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
nicer and then you do get the touch

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.840 
nicer and then you do get the touch

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
know the touch screen itself isn't you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.600 
know the touch screen itself isn't you
know<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.650> works<00:03:09.799> pretty<00:03:10.010> well<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:10.280> it's<00:03:10.549> not

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
know it works pretty well but it's not

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.300 
know it works pretty well but it's not
that<00:03:10.970> great<00:03:11.360> it's<00:03:11.600> better<00:03:11.810> than<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.310> Voyager

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
that great it's better than the Voyager

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.009 
that great it's better than the Voyager
for<00:03:13.519> sure<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:13.940> not<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.330> par<00:03:14.600> with<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.900> new

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
smartphones that are out now but mostly

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.530 
smartphones that are out now but mostly
what<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.549> means<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.090> do<00:03:20.299> more

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
what this means is you can do more

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.780 
what this means is you can do more
without<00:03:20.720> opening<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> phone<00:03:21.500> up<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.549> envy

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
without opening the phone up on the envy

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.520 
without opening the phone up on the envy
touch<00:03:22.970> than<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.299> can<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.750> envy<00:03:23.989> three<00:03:24.230> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
touch than you can on the envy three and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.870 
touch than you can on the envy three and
then<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.859> decided<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.489> actually<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
then I just decided this is actually a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.590 
then I just decided this is actually a
dogfight<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.510> not<00:03:26.630> just<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.900> review<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> nv3

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
dogfight and not just to review the nv3

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.270 
dogfight and not just to review the nv3
and<00:03:29.600> that's<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.500> how<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> rolls<00:03:30.859> sometimes

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
and that's just how it rolls sometimes
