00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
in a prone position behind them comes

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.889 
in a prone position behind them comes
today<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:44.040> cannot<00:01:44.549> hit<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.720> I'm

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
going back to that guy and I cut out the
power<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.850> he<00:01:48.030> was<00:01:48.360> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> glitching

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
power because he was kind of glitching

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
power because he was kind of glitching
in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> rib<00:01:49.530> belt<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.299> yeah<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:51.329> eventually

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
in the rib belt so I'm yeah i eventually

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
in the rib belt so I'm yeah i eventually
get<00:01:52.110> taken<00:01:52.380> down<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.680> my<00:01:52.829> friend<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> mint

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just to arm the M come again and so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.420 
just to arm the M come again and so
we're<00:01:55.439> basically<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> same<00:01:56.399> thing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
we're basically back to the same thing

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.600 
we're basically back to the same thing
right<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.750> a.m<00:01:57.960> comes<00:01:58.200> planet<00:01:58.680> right

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
right here the a.m comes planet right

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
right here the a.m comes planet right
here<00:01:59.759> another<00:01:59.969> enemy<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.570> again<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.619> just

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here another enemy and again I'm just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.459 
here another enemy and again I'm just
going<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> general<00:02:02.880> body<00:02:03.570> shot<00:02:03.930> area<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
going for the general body shot area is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
going for the general body shot area is
probably<00:02:04.799> most<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> time<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> good<00:02:05.820> idea

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
probably most of the time a good idea

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.260 
probably most of the time a good idea

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
running targets can we be a pain the ass

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.710 
running targets can we be a pain the ass
because<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:11.670> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because they're just

more<00:02:37.560> cover<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.070> also<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.460> flank<00:02:38.700> them

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
more cover and also to flank them

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.120 
more cover and also to flank them
getting<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.720> guy<00:02:39.870> who<00:02:40.410> wasn't<00:02:40.530> able<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.920> jump

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
getting that guy who wasn't able to jump

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.640 
getting that guy who wasn't able to jump
up<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.240> well<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.690> can't<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.440> either

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
up I'm not as well I can't do it either

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.120 
up I'm not as well I can't do it either
so<00:02:44.400> yet<00:02:44.790> again<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.780> basically<00:02:46.590> got<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.890> M

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
so yet again I'm we basically got the M

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.670 
so yet again I'm we basically got the M
come<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.490> it's<00:02:47.610> safe<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.720> say<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.900> pushing<00:02:49.560> up

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
come so it's safe to say that pushing up

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.960 
come so it's safe to say that pushing up
is<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> good<00:02:49.920> idea<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.459> position<00:02:50.880> because

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
is a good idea in this position because

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.060 
is a good idea in this position because
and<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.410> want<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> keep<00:02:52.830> them<00:02:53.010> from

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and we really want to keep them from

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.910 
and we really want to keep them from

us off however we managed to blow up
both<00:03:21.959> n<00:03:22.140> comes<00:03:22.380> anyway<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:23.010> again<00:03:23.310> just

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
both n comes anyway so we again just

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.370 
both n comes anyway so we again just
setting<00:03:24.090> up<00:03:24.150> behind<00:03:24.360> cover<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.840> now<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.230> all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
setting up behind cover and now it's all

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.470 
setting up behind cover and now it's all
up<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.769> us<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:26.280> clean<00:03:26.580> on<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> carrier<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.330> that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
up to us to clean on the carrier so that

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.720 
up to us to clean on the carrier so that
no<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.930> sneak<00:03:28.200> up<00:03:28.320> behind<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.769> us<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.580> yet

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
no one can sneak up behind on us so yet

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.400 
no one can sneak up behind on us so yet
again<00:03:29.850> throwing<00:03:30.269> nades<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> good<00:03:30.900> thing<00:03:31.260> on

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
again throwing nades is a good thing on

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.259 
again throwing nades is a good thing on
our<00:03:31.560> part<00:03:31.800> kind<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.160> feel<00:03:32.310> right<00:03:32.459> here<00:03:32.610> but

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
our part kind of feel right here but

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.120 
our part kind of feel right here but
throwing<00:03:33.600> c4<00:03:34.019> behind<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.410> DRAM<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.650> always<00:03:35.070> a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
throwing c4 behind the DRAM is always a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.979 
throwing c4 behind the DRAM is always a
good<00:03:35.250> idea<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:35.670> many<00:03:36.150> people<00:03:36.209> are<00:03:36.690> hiding

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
good idea because many people are hiding

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.170 
good idea because many people are hiding
there<00:03:37.320> then<00:03:38.070> yet<00:03:38.250> again<00:03:38.489> I'm<00:03:38.700> checking

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
there then yet again I'm checking

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.430 
there then yet again I'm checking
mini-map<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.870> see<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.080> guy<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.380> left

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
mini-map to see the guy on the left

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.520 
mini-map to see the guy on the left
right<00:03:40.739> here<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.810> clearing<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.959> him<00:03:43.140> as<00:03:43.290> well

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
right here and clearing out him as well

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.979 
right here and clearing out him as well
getting<00:03:44.370> killed<00:03:44.880> steal<00:03:45.060> from<00:03:45.299> my<00:03:45.480> body<00:03:45.630> there

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
getting killed steal from my body there

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.890 
getting killed steal from my body there
but<00:03:46.769> yeah<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.330> important<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.660> clean

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
but yeah it's really important to clean

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.380 
but yeah it's really important to clean
out<00:03:49.080> them<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.040> stations<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.970> just<00:03:51.209> were

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
out them the stations that you just were

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.449 
out them the stations that you just were
especially<00:03:51.810> killing<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.980> spawn<00:03:53.310> beacon

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
especially killing the spawn beacon

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.280 
especially killing the spawn beacon
sorta<00:03:53.880> radio<00:03:54.150> spawn<00:03:54.360> beatings<00:03:54.660> because<00:03:54.989> then

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
sorta radio spawn beatings because then

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.570 
sorta radio spawn beatings because then
you<00:03:55.410> cannot<00:03:55.680> get<00:03:55.890> flying<00:03:56.190> from<00:03:56.430> behind<00:03:56.959> I

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
you cannot get flying from behind I

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.620 
you cannot get flying from behind I
initially<00:03:59.580> wanted<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.910> cut<00:04:00.060> out<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.330> part

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
initially wanted to cut out this part

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.199 
initially wanted to cut out this part
right<00:04:00.660> here<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.890> good<00:04:02.010> idea<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.580> tell

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
right here but it's a good idea to tell

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.930 
right here but it's a good idea to tell
you<00:04:03.299> guys<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.709> back<00:04:05.400> into<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.790> water

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
you guys get up and back into the water

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.240 
you guys get up and back into the water
and<00:04:06.209> dive<00:04:06.450> again<00:04:06.780> you're<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.410> lot<00:04:07.620> harder<00:04:07.950> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and dive again you're a lot harder to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.460 
and dive again you're a lot harder to
hit<00:04:08.370> underwater<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.510> diving<00:04:09.900> really<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.320> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
hit underwater so diving really is the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.620 
hit underwater so diving really is the
way<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.010> mean<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.610> are<00:04:11.760> slower<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.420> it's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
way to go I mean you are slower but it's

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.030 
way to go I mean you are slower but it's
more<00:04:12.930> likely<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.620> will<00:04:13.650> survive

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
more likely that you will survive

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.710 
more likely that you will survive
especially<00:04:14.310> for<00:04:14.760> all<00:04:14.850> sniper<00:04:15.120> setting<00:04:15.510> up<00:04:15.600> on

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
especially for all sniper setting up on

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.110 
especially for all sniper setting up on
the<00:04:15.870> building<00:04:16.620> back<00:04:16.769> there<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.190> mean<00:04:18.000> which

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
the building back there I mean which

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.000 
the building back there I mean which
will<00:04:18.359> take<00:04:18.540> care<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.229> few<00:04:19.380> seconds<00:04:19.799> so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
will take care of in a few seconds so

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.790 
will take care of in a few seconds so
yeah<00:04:20.849> diving<00:04:21.419> really<00:04:21.720> helps<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.260> stay<00:04:22.590> alive

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
yeah diving really helps to stay alive

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.320 
yeah diving really helps to stay alive
as<00:04:23.039> soon<00:04:23.190> as<00:04:23.280> you're<00:04:23.400> behind<00:04:23.610> cover<00:04:23.820> like<00:04:24.060> here

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
as soon as you're behind cover like here

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.880 
as soon as you're behind cover like here
and<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:25.020> doesn't<00:04:25.260> really<00:04:25.320> matter<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.680> can

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and it doesn't really matter you can

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.840 
and it doesn't really matter you can
just<00:04:26.099> go<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.400> Sprint

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
just go for the Sprint

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.720 
just go for the Sprint
get<00:04:27.480> fat<00:04:27.660> get<00:04:28.140> there<00:04:28.290> faster<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> couple<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
get fat get there faster see a couple of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.730 
get fat get there faster see a couple of
friends<00:04:29.910> are<00:04:30.090> taking<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> left<00:04:30.990> flank<00:04:31.260> so

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
friends are taking the left flank so

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.130 
friends are taking the left flank so
it's<00:04:31.890> also<00:04:32.070> really<00:04:32.310> also<00:04:33.060> about<00:04:33.600> positioning

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
it's also really also about positioning

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.050 
it's also really also about positioning
that<00:04:34.380> you're<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:34.860> taking<00:04:35.430> different<00:04:35.730> routes

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
that you're just taking different routes

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.560 
that you're just taking different routes
so<00:04:37.020> now<00:04:37.230> right<00:04:37.440> here<00:04:37.680> until<00:04:38.220> everyone<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.210> set

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
so now right here until everyone is set

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.730 
so now right here until everyone is set
up<00:04:39.780> or<00:04:39.990> able<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.830> push<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:42.000> basically<00:04:42.480> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
up or able to push it's basically the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.200 
up or able to push it's basically the
well<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.950> duty<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.310> sniper<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.790> kill<00:04:45.030> other

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
well the duty of a sniper to kill other

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.240 
well the duty of a sniper to kill other
