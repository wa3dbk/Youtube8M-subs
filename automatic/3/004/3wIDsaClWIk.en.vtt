actually let you capture it by the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
desktop capture so it's going to be

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.889 
desktop capture so it's going to be
pretty<00:00:46.739> finicky<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.329> desktop

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pretty finicky but if you use desktop

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
pretty finicky but if you use desktop
capture<00:00:49.500> mode<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.940> some

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

to capture games as you can see it's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
to capture games as you can see it's
very<00:03:07.549> very<00:03:07.850> choppy<00:03:08.239> on<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.690> end<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.049> looks

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
very very choppy on your end it looks

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.479 
very very choppy on your end it looks
perfectly<00:03:09.530> fine<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.890> my<00:03:09.920> end<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.340> you're

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
perfectly fine on my end but you're

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.490 
perfectly fine on my end but you're
getting<00:03:10.790> between<00:03:10.970> 5<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.750> 60<00:03:12.170> frames<00:03:12.350> per

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.870 
getting between 5 and 60 frames per
second<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.190> that's<00:03:13.280> not<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> viable

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
second so that's not really a viable

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.699 
second so that's not really a viable
option<00:03:14.239> either<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.989> viable<00:03:15.200> option<00:03:15.350> if

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
option either it's a viable option if

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.140 
option either it's a viable option if
you<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:15.950> want<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.190> record<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.670> Windows<00:03:16.970> 10

you just want to record like Windows 10
but<00:03:17.450> not<00:03:17.660> recording<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.380> game<00:03:18.590> itself<00:03:19.190> Game

Capture<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.299> OBS<00:03:20.570> does<00:03:21.109> not<00:03:21.290> work<00:03:21.440> at<00:03:21.590> all<00:03:21.769> so

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
Capture in OBS does not work at all so

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.460 
Capture in OBS does not work at all so
then<00:03:22.430> how<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.090> record<00:03:23.390> Windows<00:03:23.840> 10<00:03:24.109> games

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470
