00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
circlings just don't really work not a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.549 
circlings just don't really work not a
lot<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> stuff<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.719> doesn't<00:00:34.050> work<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

lot of stuff really doesn't work but the
one<00:00:34.680> thing<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.890> found<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> kinda<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
one thing I found is kinda do a little

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990 
one thing I found is kinda do a little
bit<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.870> early<00:00:37.230> Roach<00:00:38.129> bush<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.879> we're

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
bit of an early Roach bush so we're

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
bit of an early Roach bush so we're
gonna<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.540> ahead<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> try<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> now

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
gonna go ahead and try it out it now

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.560 
gonna go ahead and try it out it now
there<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.430> fifty<00:00:41.760> percent<00:00:42.000> chance<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> our

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there is fifty percent chance that our

a 50-percent chances here and there is a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
a 50-percent chances here and there is a
0%<00:00:50.670> chance<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> Miami<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
0% chance that is going to Miami you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.819 
0% chance that is going to Miami you
know<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.430> how<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> goes<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.500> yes<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
know that's just how it goes and yes I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
know that's just how it goes and yes I
have<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.460> been<00:00:56.760> having<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> ZBZ<00:00:57.719> lately

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
have not been having a lot of ZBZ lately

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.940 
have not been having a lot of ZBZ lately
is<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.530> surprising<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.370> guys

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
is very surprising so you guys

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.430 
is very surprising so you guys
a<00:00:59.980> lot<00:01:00.340> more<00:01:00.550> Terran<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.150> Protoss<00:01:01.480> if<00:01:02.140> that's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
a lot more Terran and Protoss if that's

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.439 
a lot more Terran and Protoss if that's
the<00:01:02.680> way<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.920> keeps<00:01:03.070> going<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.580> what<00:01:04.300> I'm

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the way it keeps going is what I'm

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.740 
the way it keeps going is what I'm
saying<00:01:04.750> i<00:01:04.989> guess<00:01:05.199> um<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> I<00:01:06.970> think<00:01:07.150> what<00:01:07.570> I'm

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
saying i guess um so I think what I'm

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.750 
saying i guess um so I think what I'm
gonna<00:01:08.170> actually<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.540> think<00:01:11.350> I<00:01:11.500> won't<00:01:11.710> 15<00:01:12.460> oh

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
gonna actually do I think I won't 15 oh

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.060 
gonna actually do I think I won't 15 oh
but<00:01:13.570> then<00:01:13.690> that's<00:01:13.810> not<00:01:13.930> really<00:01:14.320> early<00:01:14.710> clash

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
but then that's not really early clash

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.500 
but then that's not really early clash
with<00:01:15.310> approach<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:18.040> go<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.340> Roman's<00:01:19.180> big<00:01:19.390> up

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
with approach I'll go to Roman's big up

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.780 
with approach I'll go to Roman's big up
to<00:01:19.540> 15<00:01:21.660> I'll<00:01:22.660> do<00:01:22.870> 15<00:01:23.260> hatch<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.490> that's<00:01:24.610> really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
to 15 I'll do 15 hatch so that's really

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.120 
to 15 I'll do 15 hatch so that's really
what<00:01:25.000> you're<00:01:25.090> supposed<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.360> do<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.950> he<00:01:26.950> just

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
what you're supposed to do and he just

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
what you're supposed to do and he just
hadn't<00:01:27.400> been<00:01:27.490> working<00:01:27.729> out<00:01:27.820> for<00:01:28.000> me<00:01:28.030> but<00:01:28.270> I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
hadn't been working out for me but I

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.570 
hadn't been working out for me but I
think<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.680> protect<00:01:30.430> it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
think I just really have to protect it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.700 
think I just really have to protect it

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.130 
I get that too under the nose there we
are<00:01:47.740> on<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.430> let's<00:01:48.580> go<00:01:48.729> on<00:01:48.759> down<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.509> build

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
are on it so let's go on down and build

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.930 
are on it so let's go on down and build
a<00:01:50.259> hatchery<00:01:50.470> hope<00:01:50.860> we<00:01:51.100> don't<00:01:51.280> get<00:01:51.430> bugger<00:01:51.790> rush

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
a hatchery hope we don't get bugger rush

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.120 
a hatchery hope we don't get bugger rush
but<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.540> feel<00:01:52.930> like<00:01:52.960> there's<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.290> good<00:01:53.440> 75<00:01:53.920> feet

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
but I feel like there's a good 75 feet

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.389 
but I feel like there's a good 75 feet
chance<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.790> will<00:01:54.940> happen<00:01:55.210> we'll<00:01:56.110> see<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
chance that it will happen we'll see and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.160 
chance that it will happen we'll see and
hopefully<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.940> can<00:01:58.060> prevent<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.600> why<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.810> there

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
hopefully I can prevent it why is there

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.290 
hopefully I can prevent it why is there
