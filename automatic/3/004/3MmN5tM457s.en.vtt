started out by rolling out some orange
clay<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.030> then<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.780> use<00:00:13.230> these<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.710> snow

snow<00:00:18.600> globes<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> they're<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.830> cheap

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
snow globes and they're pretty cheap

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.890 
snow globes and they're pretty cheap
maybe<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.640> three<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:21.060> four<00:00:21.330> dollars<00:00:21.420> each

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
maybe about three or four dollars each

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 
maybe about three or four dollars each
and<00:00:22.369> I<00:00:23.369> don't<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> might<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.970> able<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and I don't know you might be able to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.340 
and I don't know you might be able to
find<00:00:24.390> them<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.810> cheaper<00:00:24.990> than<00:00:25.109> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
find them a little bit cheaper than that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.140 
find them a little bit cheaper than that
so<00:00:25.650> basically<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.070> wrap<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> clay<00:00:26.699> around<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so basically I wrap the clay around it

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.620 
so basically I wrap the clay around it
and<00:00:27.439> then<00:00:28.439> cut<00:00:28.859> off<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> excess<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.390> at

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and then cut off the excess that was at

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
and then cut off the excess that was at
the<00:00:30.810> top<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> then<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> smooth<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the top and then I smooth it with a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
the top and then I smooth it with a
little<00:00:33.090> silicone<00:00:34.050> tool<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.980> use

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
little silicone tool but you can use

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.840 
little silicone tool but you can use
your<00:00:35.219> fingers

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
your fingers

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.780 
your fingers
they<00:00:36.090> work<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> same<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.800> once<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
they work the same and then once you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
they work the same and then once you
just<00:00:39.059> keep<00:00:39.239> smoothing<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.899> cutting<00:00:40.230> it'll

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just keep smoothing and cutting it'll

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
just keep smoothing and cutting it'll
look<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> made<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> little

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
look like this and then I made a little

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
look like this and then I made a little
pumpkin<00:00:42.930> ridges<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.950> needle<00:00:44.370> tool<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
pumpkin ridges with a needle tool and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
pumpkin ridges with a needle tool and
you<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> make<00:00:46.110> lines<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.190> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you just want to make lines that are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
you just want to make lines that are
kind<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> equally<00:00:48.480> spaced<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
kind of equally spaced they don't have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.939 
kind of equally spaced they don't have
to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.770> perfect<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.750> make<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> face<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.559> just

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to be perfect to make the face I just

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.420 
to be perfect to make the face I just
kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.949> dotting<00:00:55.949> tool<00:00:56.190> or

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
kind of use a little dotting tool or

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
kind of use a little dotting tool or
ball<00:00:56.910> tool<00:00:57.210> whatever<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> call<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
ball tool whatever you want to call it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.189 
ball tool whatever you want to call it
and<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:59.129> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> carved<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> little

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and just kind of carved out the little

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
and just kind of carved out the little
triangles<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> eyes<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.239> nose<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
triangles for the eyes and the nose and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
triangles for the eyes and the nose and
then<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.229> used<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.680> smaller<00:01:04.979> tool<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
then I used a smaller tool to make the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
then I used a smaller tool to make the
mouth<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:07.049> doesn't<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.680> perfect

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
mouth and it doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.210 
mouth and it doesn't have to be perfect
but<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.450> should<00:01:09.659> look<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
but it just should look kind of like a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
but it just should look kind of like a
pumpkin<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.510> should<00:01:12.540> Google

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pumpkin I don't know you should Google

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
pumpkin I don't know you should Google
some<00:01:13.140> pictures<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.250> help<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.520> lot

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.610 
want and then I just cut out little
strips<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> wraps<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.210> around

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
strips and wraps it around

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
until all the glass was covered and it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.210 
until all the glass was covered and it
doesn't<00:01:46.230> have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.440> be<00:01:46.530> perfect<00:01:46.980> you<00:01:47.190> just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.030 
really wanted to look like the strip
that<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.400> would<00:01:50.550> wrap<00:01:50.730> a<00:01:50.760> mummy<00:01:51.090> in

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040

something<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.160> that<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.580> then<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.820> added

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
something like that and then I added

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.630 
something like that and then I added
little<00:01:54.240> eyeballs<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.650> um<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.100> white<00:01:56.340> clay

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
little eyeballs for um with white clay

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
little eyeballs for um with white clay
and<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:56.970> make<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.810> handles<00:01:58.260> for<00:01:58.470> all<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.150 
and to make the handles for all the
buckets<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.460> use<00:02:00.000> some<00:02:00.690> black<00:02:00.900> wire<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.620> I

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
buckets I use some black wire and I

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.910 
buckets I use some black wire and I
found<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.580> at<00:02:02.670> Hobby<00:02:02.940> Lobby<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> 40%

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
found it at Hobby Lobby and I use a 40%

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.250 
found it at Hobby Lobby and I use a 40%
off<00:02:04.980> coupon<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.750> should<00:02:06.900> do<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> same

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
off coupon so you should do the same

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.100 
off coupon so you should do the same
thing<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:08.520> basically<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.600> bend<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
thing and then basically I just bend it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.830 
thing and then basically I just bend it
into<00:02:10.350> like<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.070> half<00:02:11.460> circle<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.150> measure<00:02:12.570> them

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
into like a half circle and measure them

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.420 
into like a half circle and measure them
to<00:02:13.350> make<00:02:13.500> sure<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.740> they<00:02:13.860> would<00:02:13.980> fit<00:02:14.160> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to make sure that they would fit and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.250 
to make sure that they would fit and
then<00:02:14.520> press<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.970> into<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.210> clay<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.780> then

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
then press it into the clay and then

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.190 
then press it into the clay and then
once<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.770> were<00:02:16.830> secured<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> baked<00:02:18.780> them<00:02:18.960> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
once they were secured I baked them and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.570 
once they were secured I baked them and
this<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> looks<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.220> when<00:02:20.460> it's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
this is what it looks like when it's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.030 
this is what it looks like when it's
baked<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.120> now<00:02:21.450> I'm<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.630> painting<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.470> black

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
baked and now I'm just painting a black

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.400 
baked and now I'm just painting a black
clay<00:02:23.460> into<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> eyes<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.990> nose<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
clay into the eyes and the nose in the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
clay into the eyes and the nose in the
mouth<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:26.820> adding<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
mouth and then I'm adding little

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.050 
mouth and then I'm adding little
eyeballs<00:02:27.990> onto<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.860> mummy<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.880> what

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
eyeballs onto the mummy and this is what

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.720 
eyeballs onto the mummy and this is what
it<00:02:33.120> looks<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.750> dry<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.580> can

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it looks like when it's dry and you can

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.280 
it looks like when it's dry and you can
use<00:02:35.850> better<00:02:36.090> paint<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> doesn't<00:02:36.990> look<00:02:37.050> so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
use better paint so it doesn't look so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.370 
use better paint so it doesn't look so
lumpy<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:39.600> candy<00:02:39.930> wrappers<00:02:40.260> you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and then folding them this is kind of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.110 
and then folding them this is kind of
hard<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.680> make<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.980> easier<00:03:20.459> um<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.970> can

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
hard but to make it easier um you can

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.449 
hard but to make it easier um you can
use<00:03:21.270> those<00:03:21.420> little<00:03:21.630> binder<00:03:22.260> clips<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:23.280> keep

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
use those little binder clips to keep

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.600 
use those little binder clips to keep
the<00:03:23.670> paper<00:03:23.970> folded<00:03:24.600> together

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
the paper folded together

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.000
