00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
other here is Jen for rod and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.760 
other here is Jen for rod and
piston<00:00:12.740> take<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.130> beast<00:00:14.570> and

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
piston take a look at that beast and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.900 
piston take a look at that beast and
then<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:18.170> gen<00:00:19.170> 3<00:00:19.529> oh<00:00:20.720> no<00:00:22.550> yep<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.880> we

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
then here is a gen 3 oh no yep here we

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
then here is a gen 3 oh no yep here we
go<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> bunch<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.529> there's<00:00:28.529> a

go you got a bunch here now there's a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
go you got a bunch here now there's a
difference<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> thickness<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> rod

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
difference in the thickness of the rod

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.040 
difference in the thickness of the rod
on<00:00:30.539> both<00:00:31.019> sides<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.360> my<00:00:33.360> Gen<00:00:33.570> threes<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:33.930> all

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

on both sides and my Gen threes are all
a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.200> bendy<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.180> these<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> Gen

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a little bendy and these are the Gen

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350 
a little bendy and these are the Gen
fours<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.219> floating<00:00:38.219> piston<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:39.180> are

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
fours with a floating piston these are

those<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.070> nice<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> wobbly<00:00:44.989> anyway<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.230> threw

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
those are nice and wobbly anyway I threw

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
those are nice and wobbly anyway I threw
this<00:00:46.860> motor<00:00:47.100> together<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> flat<00:00:48.570> top

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this motor together with the flat top

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.790 
this motor together with the flat top
five<00:00:49.320> three<00:00:49.590> Pistons<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.850> made<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:52.590> made

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
five three Pistons and it made it made

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
five three Pistons and it made it made
another<00:00:53.010> 40<00:00:53.460> horsepower<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.149> 20<00:00:54.480> pounds

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
another 40 horsepower on 20 pounds

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
another 40 horsepower on 20 pounds
pretty<00:00:55.140> impressive<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> ended<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.670> doing

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pretty impressive but I ended up doing

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
pretty impressive but I ended up doing
the<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.629> broke<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> ring<00:00:58.260> lands

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the same and I broke the ring lands

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
the same and I broke the ring lands
again<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> motor<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.539> finally<00:01:00.930> think

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
again in this motor and I finally think

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
again in this motor and I finally think
I<00:01:01.199> figured<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> guy<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.160> turbo<00:01:02.489> forums

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
I figured it out a guy on turbo forums

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
I figured it out a guy on turbo forums
keeps<00:01:03.059> explaining<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> me<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.739> too

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
keeps explaining to me that I have too

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
keeps explaining to me that I have too
much<00:01:04.979> timing<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.850> detonating<00:01:06.420> these

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
much timing and I'm detonating these

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.850 
much timing and I'm detonating these
poor<00:01:07.140> bastards<00:01:07.760> take<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> look<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.860> took

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
poor bastards take a look at that took

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
poor bastards take a look at that took
all<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> meat<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.320> two<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
all the meat out of that one two of the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
all the meat out of that one two of the
Pistons<00:01:13.860> maybe<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> third<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> finish

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
Pistons maybe a third I got to finish

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
Pistons maybe a third I got to finish
taking<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.540> apart<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.560> number<00:01:16.920> six<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
taking this apart I think number six is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.330 
taking this apart I think number six is
busted<00:01:17.850> also<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> ring

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
busted also but take a look at that ring

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780 
busted also but take a look at that ring
lay<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.759> gone<00:01:21.409> anyway<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.549> saying

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
lay and be gone anyway well he is saying

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
lay and be gone anyway well he is saying
is<00:01:24.030> happening<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> piston<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is happening is is when the piston see I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
is happening is is when the piston see I
broke<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> lower<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> upper<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
broke all the lower not the upper so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
broke all the lower not the upper so
he's<00:01:28.619> saying<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.100> budding<00:01:29.490> because

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
he's saying it's not budding because

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
he's saying it's not budding because
almost<00:01:30.659> ninety<00:01:30.869> percent<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.259> time<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.979> least

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
almost ninety percent of time at least

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
almost ninety percent of time at least
the<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.369> explained<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.810> the

the way it's explained to me is when the
ring<00:01:34.079> butts<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.770> rips<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> ring

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
ring butts it rips the top of the ring

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
ring butts it rips the top of the ring
land<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> Pistons<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> its<00:01:38.040> way

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

it's pre igniting and it's shoving all

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's pre igniting and it's shoving all
the<00:01:55.920> Rings<00:01:56.130> down<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.729> hard<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.299> its<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:57.630> up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the Rings down really hard on its way up

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
the Rings down really hard on its way up
and<00:01:58.079> while<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and while this is going up and the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.819 
and while this is going up and the
compressions<00:02:00.149> knocking<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.530> grabs

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
compressions knocking it down it grabs

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
compressions knocking it down it grabs
that<00:02:02.130> ring<00:02:02.340> land<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.790> breaks<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.390> through

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
that ring land it breaks right through

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
that ring land it breaks right through
all<00:02:03.810> these<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.350> mean<00:02:04.649> stock<00:02:04.920> fragile<00:02:05.579> ring

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
all these I mean stock fragile ring

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.880 
all these I mean stock fragile ring
lands<00:02:06.090> smashes<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.590> through

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
lands smashes right the through

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.160 
lands smashes right the through
them<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:09.179> we're<00:02:09.300> gonna<00:02:09.360> try<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.959> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
them so what we're gonna try to do is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.260 
them so what we're gonna try to do is
take<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> bunch<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.430> timing<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> car

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
take out a bunch of timing in the car

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.530 
take out a bunch of timing in the car
and<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.629> if<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> survives

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and see if it survives

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.380 
and see if it survives
and<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:13.959> we'll<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.260> sure<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and then we'll know for sure that you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.259 
and then we'll know for sure that you
know<00:02:16.540> that's<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.319> problem<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.000> rest<00:02:19.180> of

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
know that's the problem but the rest of

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.570 
know that's the problem but the rest of
the<00:02:19.360> motor<00:02:19.620> still<00:02:20.620> looks<00:02:20.830> great<00:02:21.129> as<00:02:21.340> always

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the motor still looks great as always

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.070 
the motor still looks great as always
it's<00:02:21.970> still<00:02:22.180> scuffed<00:02:22.540> up<00:02:22.720> from<00:02:22.930> when<00:02:23.049> I

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
it's still scuffed up from when I

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.649 
it's still scuffed up from when I
scuffed<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.640> head<00:02:24.790> gaskets<00:02:25.239> were<00:02:25.390> fine<00:02:25.629> I

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
scuffed it the head gaskets were fine I

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.690 
scuffed it the head gaskets were fine I
reused<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.409> ls1<00:02:26.680> head<00:02:27.010> gaskets<00:02:27.459> I'm<00:02:27.580> gonna

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
reused the ls1 head gaskets I'm gonna

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.300 
reused the ls1 head gaskets I'm gonna
reuse<00:02:28.000> them<00:02:28.120> again<00:02:28.620> because<00:02:29.620> they're<00:02:30.099> not<00:02:30.250> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
reuse them again because they're not a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.830 
reuse them again because they're not a
point<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> failure<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.450> I'm<00:02:31.569> gonna<00:02:31.660> keep

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
point of failure so I'm gonna keep

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.530 
point of failure so I'm gonna keep
pushing<00:02:32.230> those<00:02:32.459> until<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.970> know<00:02:34.420> if

pushing those until they you know if

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.869 
pushing those until they you know if
they<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> problem<00:02:35.110> I'll<00:02:35.349> put<00:02:35.560> better<00:02:36.489> ones

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
they have a problem I'll put better ones

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.759 
they have a problem I'll put better ones
on<00:02:37.090> everybody<00:02:37.569> says<00:02:37.810> Ellis<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.260> I'm<00:02:38.379> ones<00:02:38.620> are

on everybody says Ellis and I'm ones are
better

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
better

well<00:02:39.760> me<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.629> buddy<00:02:40.900> say<00:02:41.200> how<00:02:41.799> do<00:02:41.860> people

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
well me and my buddy say how do people

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
well me and my buddy say how do people
ever<00:02:42.340> make<00:02:42.459> lots<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.909> horsepower<00:02:43.209> an<00:02:43.480> ls1

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
ever make lots of horsepower an ls1

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.449 
ever make lots of horsepower an ls1
engines<00:02:44.319> before<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.040> Ellis<00:02:45.250> nine

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
engines before the Ellis nine

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.470 
engines before the Ellis nine
engine<00:02:45.849> came<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.209> also<00:02:46.989> an<00:02:47.200> LS<00:02:47.470> nine<00:02:47.739> gasket

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
engine came out also an LS nine gasket

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.449 
engine came out also an LS nine gasket
isn't<00:02:49.480> as<00:02:49.569> large<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> five<00:02:50.650> three<00:02:50.980> or<00:02:51.160> an<00:02:51.220> ls1

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
isn't as large as a five three or an ls1

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.509 
isn't as large as a five three or an ls1
bores<00:02:51.910> much<00:02:52.329> tighter<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.379> an<00:02:53.530> LS<00:02:53.769> nine<00:02:53.950> gaskets

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
bores much tighter so an LS nine gaskets

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.099 
bores much tighter so an LS nine gaskets
gonna<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.150> farther<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.870> actually

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
gonna be out farther and it actually

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.500 
gonna be out farther and it actually
gives<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.379> less<00:02:56.910> surface<00:02:57.910> area<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.359> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
gives you less surface area on the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.619 
gives you less surface area on the
gasket<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> mean<00:02:59.849> I'm<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.940> practical<00:03:01.420> person

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
gasket so I mean I'm a practical person

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.229 
gasket so I mean I'm a practical person
I<00:03:01.810> question<00:03:02.290> how<00:03:02.470> how<00:03:03.370> much<00:03:03.549> better<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:04.060> they

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
I question how how much better can they

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.640 
I question how how much better can they
be<00:03:04.420> just<00:03:04.660> because<00:03:04.959> it's<00:03:05.109> more<00:03:05.260> layers<00:03:05.530> of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
be just because it's more layers of

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.220 
be just because it's more layers of
steel<00:03:06.099> that's<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:07.269> steel<00:03:07.480> gasket<00:03:08.079> the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
steel that's a steel gasket the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.160 
steel that's a steel gasket the
LS<00:03:08.470> nine<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.859> steel<00:03:09.069> gasket<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:10.140> really<00:03:11.140> I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
LS nine is a steel gasket I really I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.599 
LS nine is a steel gasket I really I
don't<00:03:11.379> see<00:03:11.650> too<00:03:11.859> much<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.220> difference

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
don't see too much of a difference

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.729 
don't see too much of a difference
unless<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.239> lifts<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.660> head<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.049> someone

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
unless this lifts a head and someone

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.740 
unless this lifts a head and someone
proves<00:03:14.859> me<00:03:15.099> wrong<00:03:15.340> which<00:03:15.970> that's<00:03:16.359> always<00:03:16.599> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
proves me wrong which that's always a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.270 
proves me wrong which that's always a
fact<00:03:17.019> there<00:03:17.200> we<00:03:17.410> could<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.889> I'll<00:03:18.069> admit

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
fact there we could do that I'll admit

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.780 
fact there we could do that I'll admit
defeat

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
defeat

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.640 
defeat
but<00:03:19.510> until<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:21.160> my<00:03:21.430> update<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.780> got<00:03:23.620> a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
but until then that's my update I got a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.650 
but until then that's my update I got a
fresh<00:03:23.950> set<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> some<00:03:24.790> soldiers<00:03:25.239> here<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.599> are

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
fresh set of some soldiers here that are

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.500 
fresh set of some soldiers here that are
gonna<00:03:25.750> go<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.549> we're<00:03:27.700> gonna<00:03:27.790> stomp<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.389> it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
gonna go in and we're gonna stomp on it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.710 
gonna go in and we're gonna stomp on it
again<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.459> my<00:03:30.669> quick<00:03:30.849> update<00:03:31.239> showing

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
again so that's my quick update showing

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.890 
again so that's my quick update showing
