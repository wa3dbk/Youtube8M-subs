00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:12.559
 Yeah 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:17.060
 This will explain the fireplace stove oven Alor 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:25.100
 So far, the name has been seated, but our members 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:29.840
 I have heard the feedback and got the opinion that the application is now in full swing . 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:33.260
 I have been temporarily ordered and structured on this stove 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.690
 I want to go first. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.309
 There is a practice in the combustion chamber of rocket stove that is important 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:48.979
 It is a continuous combustion unit to which all the basics 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:55.069
 By good words from the interview portion of the hot combustion occurs where gajigoseo me 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:58.129
 I'll make it happen and keep this heat inside as much as possible. 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:04.760
 Take the heat to the outside of the body 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:08.630
 It is such a structure that has come to the top 10 effects of surer fuel with less fuel 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.330
 Here, where we are now eoyeo by fermentation 2 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.900
 My position is to rescue you. 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.340
 So here we have so catch fire gajigoseo 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.560
 If the passage by being thus so to claim itja structure, so this is the most 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.860
 It takes a lot of heat. 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:36.070
 Any matter yeogida Now look what language to study what see what various pork 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:41.830
 So it can open structure'm So now that you have come to the miracles 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:46.180
 Uh here again and have one plate here to open delay 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.080
 This way, I have to go this way and the heat will come here 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:56.290
 Again and again to below here 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.030
 Open burning in front of the fence here at nine points out of control here in the chimney 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.330
 I insulated the fire. 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:09.310
 The burner is in front of us again . 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:15.700
 The refractory brick resin was there with our alc bricks 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 Gajigoseo the bottom side until I fill insulation perlite to have the insulation 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:26.440
 So it's possible to generate as much heat as possible so that it can ferment in it. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.260
 That seems within the structure so that the heat out in the summer outside, 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.040
 As far as possible 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 That's the structure that can get the most out of yesterday 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.769
 That is all 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 5 ah 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.410
 Ah 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.150
 per te 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.950
 U
