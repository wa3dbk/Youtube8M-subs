00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.859
 of the activity already past both of the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.559

 had touched the battalion then the 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.940
 turn was from brighton as point while 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.109
 so much there is an intervention of 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.289
 animation that for that that hires to 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.140

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.329
 said we have a special prize for the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.329
 most daring girl but I never 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.530
 both clear is there and good so 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.229
 true is that first of all I want 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 apologize to the whole audience with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.220
 all the followers all the people that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.929
 follow our work also from a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 trajectory of more than 13 years in the 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.860
 means and I think it's the first time 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 that we find ourselves involved in this kind of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.079
 scandal is not our style I am 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.149
 a person of Christian values 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.130
 instilled by a family and all that 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.259
 but what do I know? 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.459
 as I told you at the beginning I think the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.860
 emotion the heat of the moment see maybe 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.360
 was that the game took me to that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.209
 took to that there's what I was sharing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.189
 with my in-laws hurlant is that you are 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.649
 an example of youth because the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 people follow you and people see you as a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.110
 example for new generations and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.060
 now then that's why you're more in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.349
 the hurricane eye or more people you 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.229
 look because you are the new generation 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.000
 and not only that, I'm very expected 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 for the fact because it also tells you 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.060
 15 years old imagine you I go out with a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 photography removing the fires 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 in the middle of the stage or that's where I spent ful 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 ful ful ful thousand apologies of truth that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.510
 yes 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.780
 Of course, the young woman is not a minor and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.580
 if it were in case it had been 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.430
 of age, the problem would not be 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.680
 we as animators there is a is a 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.480
 unique element that is a regulation of 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.720
 business that I suppose with a business 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.019
 that operates in night hours has to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 be clear that no is not allowed 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.350
 access of minors to the place but 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.390
 the girl or the girl is better said 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.430
 fortunately also so that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.010
 the matter keeps digging so 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.840
 Carlos thank you for this opportunity 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.580

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.650

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.940
 the Dominican Republic that has been made 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.239
 echo of this negative news hurts that 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.360
 diego is sounding a little bit more for 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.670
 something negative not for the red one also if 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.879
 the recordings made during a 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.800
 years for the presentation is the problem 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.709
 that you are a professional and it is one of 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.190
