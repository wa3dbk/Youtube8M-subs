hi<00:00:00.539> YouTube<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:01.230> am<00:00:01.560> doing<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.310> metal<00:00:02.850> studded

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hi YouTube I am doing this metal studded

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.840 
hi YouTube I am doing this metal studded
nail<00:00:03.600> art<00:00:03.810> design<00:00:04.470> today<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.980> I've<00:00:05.580> started

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
nail art design today and I've started

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.540 
nail art design today and I've started
off<00:00:06.060> with<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.450> silver<00:00:06.930> base<00:00:07.230> color<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.799> I'm

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
off with a silver base color and I'm

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.549 
off with a silver base color and I'm
also<00:00:08.790> using<00:00:08.940> masking<00:00:09.510> tape<00:00:09.750> because<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.469> is

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
also using masking tape because it is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.230 
also using masking tape because it is
less<00:00:10.769> likely<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.429> pull<00:00:11.610> off<00:00:11.730> your<00:00:11.759> nail<00:00:12.120> polish

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
less likely to pull off your nail polish

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
less likely to pull off your nail polish
underneath<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.799> let<00:00:13.980> your<00:00:14.099> nail

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
underneath but if you let your nail

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.919 
underneath but if you let your nail
polish<00:00:14.370> completely<00:00:14.940> dry<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.389> should<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.750> fine

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
polish completely dry you should be fine

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.529 
polish completely dry you should be fine
and<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> taped<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.359> just

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and this is how I taped it up it's just

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.620 
and this is how I taped it up it's just
very<00:00:18.990> metal<00:00:19.500> edgy<00:00:20.010> inspired<00:00:20.670> straight<00:00:21.359> lines

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
very metal edgy inspired straight lines

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.259 
very metal edgy inspired straight lines
and<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.680> made<00:00:22.890> sense<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:23.820> magnetic

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and it made sense to me to use magnetic

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.679 
and it made sense to me to use magnetic
nail<00:00:24.570> polish<00:00:25.010> because<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:27.000> finish<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.449> very

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
nail polish because the finish is very

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.939 
nail polish because the finish is very
metal<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.830> metal<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.849> magnetic<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.019> i<00:00:31.289> am

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
metal like in metal is magnetic so i am

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
metal like in metal is magnetic so i am
just<00:00:31.980> painting<00:00:32.550> over<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> tape<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> using

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
just painting over the tape and using

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
just painting over the tape and using
the<00:00:34.200> magnet<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> comes<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> nail

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the magnet that comes with the nail

00:00:35.820 --> 00:01:56.410
