00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.160
 [Laughs] 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.729
 [Music] 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.450
 [Music] 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.430
 well I do not know if I saw it well there's not much 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.700
 light here but let's take it out there 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.470
 now it has been much better 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.350
 what I was watching you have 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.200
 appeared here 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 It's like a shell from Santiago 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 what he had to do before he had 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 removed has been we did not know it was like that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.620
 let's take it out and we'll give it a 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.750
 little linseed oil with a lot much 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.360
 turpentine I do not want a layer to remain 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.610
 of flaxseed oil here I want you to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.750
 avoid only the oxidation and that remains 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 this aspect 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.990
 As you can see, I always have a boat 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 there 50% flaxseed oil 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 I know that this is a little more than 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.869
 turpentine than flaxseed oil 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.880
 possibly now it's 30 percent 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.880
 of linseed oil with turpentine 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.610
 that is a third part d 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.450
 the good flaxseed oil we give you well 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 with a brush 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 to remove the excess oil we're going 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.049
 to wipe now 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.049
 and we have prepared it 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.410
 a piece that can already be used 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.660
 perfectly again 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.360
 [Applause] 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.120
 like the old irons does not deserve the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370
 Pain to paint them 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.760
 Well, directly if I wanted to 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.879
 you can paint them you can not paint 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 nothing would break down we would not see the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.920
 beauty of that iron 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.840
 but we are really keeping it 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.370
 for posterity then good 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.090
 if someone wants to paint to me is that they do not 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.090
 I like to paint it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.670
 when we are going to use it, it goes away 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.580
 to stay here because they brought it to me 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.959
 they gave it to me the other day it's going to 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.650
 stay here in the forge so that 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.580
 we learn to make pieces like this 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.580
 pretty pieces 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.879
 when we are going to use it if 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.359
 we want to use a restoration 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.780
 and you really have to do it like useful 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.489
 these nails if we want to straighten them 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.980
 we will have to heat them we can not 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.750
 straighten them on the anvil or pulling with 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.860
 the pincer directly because the most 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.930
 easy is that they split 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.330
 yes that gives us the result of heating it in the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.800
 forges heat the nail and straightens it 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.560
 hot 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.300
 and then we do not think of templarlo 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.640
 because if not the carpenter when he goes to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.680
 put it when you have to twist the and 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.200
 it is tempered we have wet it in the water 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.380
 what we do is let it cool 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.130
 after cool quietly and leave 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.130
 cooling little by little 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.810
 so that the iron is soft 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.890
 we can not straighten it out and throw it to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.199
 water then what are we 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.650
 doing is too hard nails 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.030
 so you can bend the carpenter 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.639
 with ourselves and we have to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.550
 place the low place because when folding 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.870
 or it is very hard or in the end the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.790
 tip 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.080
 then we can not use it as it is 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.110
 he was using for years 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.520
 Well, this is a simple way 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.270
 to notice that there was something left 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.449
 see it and now 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.969
 well, almost 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.620
 all those bites that you have make you 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.620
 be prettier still 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.099
 we will pass a traffic 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.300
 and we have another piece to be able 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:04.979
 use well to learn or to 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.350
 to make reproductions of a piece 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.370
 ancient 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.849
 we can come very well 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.849
 thank you very much come
