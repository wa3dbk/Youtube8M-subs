00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.589
 good morning everyone guys are first 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:10.450
 that deserves around today with new ones up 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:12.670
 how to make credit 14 last team is one 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.559
 series that I hadn't picked up in a long time 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.130
 you practically don't have to take it 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.130
 from the beginning of the last team this year I have 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 decided to start over to be able to do it 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.539
 combine the server with other series such as 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.810
 rabbit the team reform the week o 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:39.399
 as or with a new series that I am going to 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:41.410
 go and offer yourself then sorry this 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.329
 a little in paper however the method of 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.250
 today is not a real trick on 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.200
 how to go about operating on the market 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.760
 transfer list or south and on yours 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.110
 credits is more like a way to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.980
 save credits through i 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.500
 contracts 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.160
 yes because there is a way to save 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.879
 through contracts practically like 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.010
 you know the contracts have a con 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.229
 specific value for example those gold 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.750
 if you apply them a bronze for 15 if them 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.000
 apply silver they have more 11 if them 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.939
 have heaven go go apply to a 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.930
 gold player will have value 13 but there is a 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.080
 way to increase this its value 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.060
 initial way to increase only from 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 only realizing is given by the modifier 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 staff in fact when to apply a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.770
 object there is initial value of the object 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.590
 therefore cash that has value 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.710
 of the object that is the contracts that it gives 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.350
 that staff modifier card I am 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.240
 additional contracts and final value 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.189
 the object then almost as many 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.750
 contracts should have applied later 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.720
 that you had would apply the card 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.369
 we will have to go and touch the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.830
 modifier st how do you go to 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.350
 change your own 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.460
 staff modifier through the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.380
 coaches you find on the market 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.420
 because the coaches have 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 there are specific features 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 some say they are honorary ones that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 they Treaties percent for those 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.190
 rare silver that they treated 22 for 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.410
 one hundred those not rare gold they have 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 1 percent negotiation 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.440
 he had everyone else what it means 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.350
 this being and we are going to add so many 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 percentages up to a maximum of 50 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 having a bunch of coaches doing you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.720
 get to that figure then 50 per 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.940
 one hundred 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.180
 we could have a bonus on contracts 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.790
 by 50 percent which means if 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.770
 let's apply to a player a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.190
 gold contract to a player a 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.290
 contract will receive 13 contracts on the 50th 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.570
 percent that you are then will receive 19 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.920
 I know that the first contracts the deprivation 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 at first it may seem stupid 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.830
 let's say we study seem like a thing 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 maybe that doesn't affect so much because it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.390
 it was based on the extra contracts what 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.560
 what do you want them to be but I guarantee you that 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.500
 in the end there is some savings 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.890
 there is savings because there is a big one 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 difference on 13 contracts or 19 because 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.459
 this year is not the end 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.680
 met they cost very much gold contracts 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.680
 cost 250 maybe they are also found 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.440
 even 200 this year though 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.739
 in the end a very saving source 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.060
 useful very profitable one can use that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.000
 it has been used in the right way can 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.390
 earn you many credits because of 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.890
 example if those six more matches 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.350
 those seemed more successful in winning 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.830
 the division a tournament anything 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.580
 it happens they are all that more than later 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.110
 met but then you will save in 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.739
 a future to buy him a player 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.349
 strong what I know 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.090
 then oh well I also know that some coaches 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.430
 I can really so much for example 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:15.910
 at first I took it 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.109
 and I remember that it really cost so much 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.209
 four thousand now in the clips 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.580
 I don't know where we are because I am 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.080
 narrating unfortunately later because it is 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.020
 success a problem in storytelling 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.210
 Initial anyway I remember that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.300
 it cost 4000 mah you don't need to go 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.780
 to spend 4 thousand for a coach like 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.520
 love what i want to say that with 4 thousand 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.350
 we can buy a material and the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.130
 coaches who have one percent 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.169
 because then torino rare even if here 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.090
 see also if you have seen them at a 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.130
 a little high but now I think you can 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.440
 find quietly at 200 o 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.479
 even if you manage to do al 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.080
 contrary coach with auctions also 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:01.039
 even 150 could accumulate 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.840
 many coaches coming to the 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.900
 they will give you the price of them 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.660
 still 5 previous compared to 3 for 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.599
 one hundred for a single coach for 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.240
 I say all the honorary coaches I have 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.849
 wanted to appreciate for the pressure of di 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.630
 style we say a factor of visibility 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:24.919
 of something that honestly is me 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:27.080
 really liked this bonus of course 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.110
 does not apply only to for met but it is worth 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.810
 also for physical forms it is also valid 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.349
 for workouts there is power ups 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.349
 of the shot 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.180
 dribbling header speed the most 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.509
 15 plus 15 in which 10 to speak if 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.810
 you have a more a staff card than those 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.570
 found in the packages that will go to 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.070
 touch that I know the speed 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.800
 maybe she went to apply a 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.220
 speed training for a player e 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.370
 in addition to the initial value it will also give you 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.280
 an additional bonus that won't be huge 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.919
 but I don't know I don't even know how much 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.000
 honestly, however, if it always does 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.280
 always comfortable 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.240
 and so it also applies in physical forms if 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.180
 for example you have a card 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.860
 staff that gives more 3 percent formed 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.580
 which I don't remember now seems to me de 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.820
 you fell to 15 percent anyway you have to 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.219
 click the bronze card you will have 20 more 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.469
 a top 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:34.760
 now for prostheses which is not very useful 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:36.200
 because in the end they don't cost much and yes 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.169
 they can also find a lot 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.630
 easy however it is always always convenient 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.719
 even if these bonuses are in the end 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.719
 fundamental especially for contracts 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.590
 having said that I have nothing left from 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.240
 tell him I hope you have my video there 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.860
 useful state 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.570
 I'm sorry I told you later e 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.190
 so don't go so much with the 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:03.919
 so unfortunately take care of 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.930
 this time we will see you tomorrow with 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.800
 a video on the best of the team of the 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.419
 week and then maybe see you Friday with 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.130
 a whole new series 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:17.139
 I greet you all this 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.139
 exhilarating from the fans he deserves
