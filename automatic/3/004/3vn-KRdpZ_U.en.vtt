00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.800
 hello everybody , welcome, one more chat 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.690
 here on our channel net city only channel 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.520
 continuing the previous one that 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.830
 This is a scientific calculator. 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.589
 calculator wheeling android you can 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.089
 download free at place tonita and 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.279
 simply one of the best 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.310
 scientific calculators in the world are 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.949
 for this type of application 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.599
 we saw in the previous class that he dug 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.430
 if you have not seen it yet please 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.110
 click on this link to see how the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.750
 people do the correction calculations of 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.680
 power factor using the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.240
 logical algebra that is the model that 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.190
 I find it more complicated, you have to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.500
 make a series of notes here since 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.980
 the buyer at speedy has no memory 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 enough to do the calculation and now 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.920
 We're going to make that same calculation. 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.960
 using the reverse Polish notation 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.180
 tac is an advanced way to make 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.520
 calculation and you will be surprised 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.299
 speed with which we are going to do this 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.340
 calculation 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.399
 first we will configure the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 calculator for reverse polish vote 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.380
 here is rpm 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.850
 there and I'll do all this calculation here 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.299
 without making any notes on the paper and 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.950
 in extremely fast time really 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.319
 It's surprising 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.659
 if you learn to use the notation 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.359
 Portuguese reverse never again you go 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.039
 want to use direct logic algebra 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.850
 in the scientific calculator 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.350
 then the local people tried to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.499
 problem situation is the following I have 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.079
 an emotional charge of $ 8,500 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:50.319
 okay this load has a power factor 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.700
 of point 85 and we intend to correct 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:57.340
 power factor for points 97 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.689
 looks at the active power of the load and eight 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.329
 thousand and 500 watts and the apparent power r 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.729
 10 thousand 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.590
 therefore a considerable loss is here 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.629
 when we correct this factor 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.129
 power against 97 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.480
 We're going to bring this much value. 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.879
 close to being that he 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 losses are low 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.450
 power 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.840
 for this you need to size a bank 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.150
 capacitors and that's what we're going to do. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.250
 in less than 10 seconds with the help of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.890
 Your Calculator That In Notation Mode 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.760
 Polish Reverse 1.85 Cosine Shift 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:45.760
 agent 1.97 shift cosine tangent less 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.569
 eight thousand and 500 times I have already 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.390
 low bank value 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.280
 3.13 kbr tÃ¡ 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 I already found the same value that we 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.010
 we find a previous calculation and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 rounding up to 3 avaÃ­ 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.900
 This is the Polish reverse annotation that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.060
 I think it's great to do calculations 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.970
 because the calculator has already been stored 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.000
 in memory all the local steps that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.220
 You do it in very fast mode, okay? 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.329
 repeat here for your pretension 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.540
 How do you do that I typed here? 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.849
 I typed the advice is to see high - one 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220
 I got it right 85 and I got it 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.410
 so many people put the advice 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.290
 high - one of 97 points and then 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.239
 I've already put his agent in 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.700
 decrease the value of these results and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:43.480
 I found the multiplying factor 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:47.079
 Look at the speed of the car 1.85 shift 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.430
 concentrates people scored 97 shift and 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.690
 tangent cosine 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:58.470
 - it's 8 thousand and 500 times 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.700
 then five seconds to do the calculation 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.530
 seize the opportunity the couch team 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.260
 Show you where the people are. 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:12.099
 down there in the prehistoric 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.599
 the name of the royal prosecutor is 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 cauc 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.799
 This one is there so you drop this. 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.440
 calculator that is free 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 on your android and will simply have 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.480
 the best scientific calculators of the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.160
 world for free on your android go 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.440
 redo complex engineering calculations 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.070
 including those of correction factor 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.900
 power will be used including 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.950
 Polish annotation that is a 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.290
 way of calculating where you calculate is 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.730
 complex calculations in very few 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.440
 seconds and you do not have to go back 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.630
 absolutely nothing nowhere 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.610
 because the hard cup will store all 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.810
 the local roque stages 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.180
 In addition, the calculator works with a 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.490
 based hexadecimal bad this total 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.490
 plenary and this is very useful for 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.710
 who works with digital electronics 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.230
 So that's it, folks, we're staying. 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.190
 here's until our next hit 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.090
 chat 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.090
 a hug
