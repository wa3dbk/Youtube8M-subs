problem or anything to worry about the
movements<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.560> added<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:37.979> unique

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
movements i think they added some unique

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
movements i think they added some unique
style<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:39.450> movements<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.380> certain

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
style two movements for you to certain

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
style two movements for you to certain
players<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.759> depending<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.390> they

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
players I think depending on what they

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
players I think depending on what they
would<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.049> real<00:01:43.200> life<00:01:43.549> commentary

which<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.050> pretty<00:02:50.380> cool<00:02:50.680> how<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:51.400> doesn't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
which is pretty cool how they doesn't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.810 
which is pretty cool how they doesn't
have<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.480> commentaries<00:02:53.459> decent<00:02:54.459> or
