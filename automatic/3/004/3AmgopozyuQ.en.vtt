00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.170
 hello everyone today we will find out 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.670
 which gives online tuning for a vase 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.670
 let's remember our configuration that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.490
 He is about here is the receiver on the stinger 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 3.3 liters throttle fifty 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.080
 six millimeters here and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.380
 filter nulevik smoke we have new 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 I made the online setup of the machine skated 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 blend angles and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.219
 amendment chipping it well let's 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.239
 First, let's see what we engineering 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.940
 general engineering engineering kit 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:45.660
 block here it is we have January 5 1 tons 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 grandfather need a laptop that's what's in general 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.120
 complete 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 for 26,000 here comes the host cable for 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 firmware it separate goes downturn 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.030
 loader 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 and 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.190
 and here we have a cable to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.800
 connect to the engineering unit itself 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.290
 when he is already on the car about herself 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.090
 setting I will not speak if anyone 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 that is interesting but then separate videos from 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.800
 her that how you set up there atmospheric 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.430
 setting up is very simple here and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.020
 sure we need to configure 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.800
 broadband oxygen sensor through 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.399
 transition 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.479
 yusbi on whom goes let's see how u 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.460
 us put to put it stationary 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.060
 we didnâ€™t just miss the car 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.000
 through the window here is the controller itself and shdk 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.360
 he himself screwed there already exhaust manifold 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.179
 we only have you so far now 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 let's make two measurements the first measurement on 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:01.280
 stock blocks that is, how will we go 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.320
 last time was 1354 in my 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.929
 Well, we will make a new measurement because 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.509
 the weather is different here and then we put 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.650
 January 5 1 already ordinary block for 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.880
 sewn there by katana firmware 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.390
 let's see what will be the dynamics 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.670
 here and in passing, I will tell you what I changed in 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 the program we will see porch she 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.650
 first, faster, then we'll talk 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.250
 about the results well, let's do everything 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.840
 froze as we will do first 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.140
 froze now here is our block in c-51 which 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.750
 the car stood in it flooded with natural 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.110
 stock firmware for this car and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.239
 here we have stitched January 5 1 it without 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.200
 markings on the Klitschko code 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.099
 got lost but now we put in with 51 and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.099
 make a measurement 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:10.549
 but we made a measurement on the standard block 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.340
 we are from 51 what we got 13 10 0 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:18.019
 100 in it moved out without passengers so 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:24.159
 you can just watch how much gives 70 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:27.260
 a kilo of weight that's 13 and 1 quarterers 1875 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:33.139
 maximum acceleration 044 i'm on 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.590
 start here about every hour we put 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:40.989
 block january 5 1 already flooded with katana 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.989
 firmware and we will do 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.500
 so did we stop for rollback 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.659
 firmware see what we did 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.000
 We have 157 but 100 but here under gorochku 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.879
 but started from the very place that I 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.349
 passed the visibility is not guided 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:15.590
 worth them here we have become 1788 that is but 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.750
 sheet and back not immediately two seconds but 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.760
 almost 2 and a half and 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.510
 second off on the battery 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.010
 maximum acceleration is also 0 45 well 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.260
 about the start was the same as 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.310
 last time I tell you what I did 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.300
 in the firmware why 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:44.590
 get this result, we let 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:52.370
 so let's see the first thing we did 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:55.460
 increased the cut-off filing misfire with us 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.800
 It costs 7,500 that is, it twisted of course 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.560
 less where by 1 7 207 400 twisted by 2 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.550
 somewhere around 7,000 why such a thing 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.590
 do because when I shot the login 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.930
 the canopy can be seen that the maximum moment 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:18.470
 we have half 6000 maximum 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.840
 power is 7 thousand and above that is up to 7000 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.639
 is about us increasing consumption 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.690
 we had maximum air 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:33.400
 consumption of 300 one kilogram of air in 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:36.110
 hour maximum moment but there 386 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.960
 milligram per cycle i mean i'm under 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.240
 inclined to fill watched this what i 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.909
 made with a mixture 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:50.120
 dimples basics blend mode I set 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:53.150
 everything from 1800 rpm at 12 and 8 12 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.130
 5 at the end that is, this is not measured 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.330
 ate a few measurements looked better 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:03.629
 so it happened 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:06.330
 up to five and a half thousand we have 12 and 8 a 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.389
 then better 12 5 months sat still 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.889
 12 8 12 5 here's the results 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:16.169
 so angles and i raised about degrees on 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.930
 ten in all in the car sleep mode 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.969
 in the whole range 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.979
 I do not know why there are such low angles 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.219
 worth that is no knock nothing 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.379
 there was a car you can raise corners even higher 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.990
 simple stayed there meters arranged 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.650
 just roll back constantly back and forth 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:37.560
 five kilometers but I no longer wanted 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.780
 so it is clear that the power was higher here 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.870
 if you take on the flow of air is powerful 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.520
 that's about a hundred horsepower now not 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:49.319
 I know a lot of it is my first floor I 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.379
 Iron for the first time tell me the line 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:55.680
 firmware gas composition mixture I put 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:57.659
 12 5 in fact nothing more i'm not 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.490
 changed that is all it took setting 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:02.659
 hours somewhere two and a half along with 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.879
 measurements are quite well, here's the result 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:08.759
 roughly speaking we spent on our tuning 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:14.310
 only 5,000 rubles i.e. throttle 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:17.069
 became 600 rubles receiver 4 400 and filter 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.680
 there 600 i just got talking interesting 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:21.919
 look at the past video that is now 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.969
 she rides on priora level 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:27.120
 It would be interesting , of course, to call in with 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.919
 Prior to stock well, let's see 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.529
 be find someone and already do 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:36.639
 then stopped it already here 

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:38.809
 that's all if you are interested in the topic 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.399
 Subscribe will be more interesting to 

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:43.489
 we have a spider go now 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.619
 negotiate with the person who 

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:48.069
 will we be able to put ourselves I don't want to go there 

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:50.899
 climb the first two pit 

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:52.839
 second it is better to give it to those who 

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:56.499
 professionally engaged in the release 

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:59.109
 just spend less time and money 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:02.769
 if the video liked put huskies 

00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:02.769
 see you soon
