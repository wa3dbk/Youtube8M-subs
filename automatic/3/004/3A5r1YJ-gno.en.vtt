00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
hi I'm Nicky Clarke today I'm going to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.130 
hi I'm Nicky Clarke today I'm going to
show<00:00:15.559> you<00:00:15.619> a<00:00:16.099> quick<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.150> easy<00:00:17.180> way<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.689> get<00:00:18.080> a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
show you a quick and easy way to get a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.859 
show you a quick and easy way to get a
just<00:00:18.439> a<00:00:18.529> different<00:00:18.890> type<00:00:19.220> of<00:00:19.250> curl<00:00:19.669> now<00:00:20.480> as<00:00:20.720> you

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
just a different type of curl now as you

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.510 
just a different type of curl now as you
can<00:00:21.020> see<00:00:21.230> I've<00:00:21.380> already<00:00:21.560> pre<00:00:21.919> done<00:00:22.130> some<00:00:22.400> of

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
can see I've already pre done some of

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.620 
can see I've already pre done some of
these<00:00:22.669> but<00:00:22.939> I'm<00:00:23.029> just<00:00:23.150> going<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.390> show<00:00:23.599> you

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
these but I'm just going to show you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.470 
these but I'm just going to show you
what<00:00:23.960> we<00:00:24.110> did<00:00:24.490> so<00:00:25.490> more<00:00:25.640> dairy<00:00:25.849> kitchen<00:00:26.240> foil

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
what we did so more dairy kitchen foil

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.750 
what we did so more dairy kitchen foil
although<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.260> is<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.679> dressing<00:00:28.099> foil<00:00:28.369> you

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
although this is a dressing foil you

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.740 
although this is a dressing foil you
just<00:00:29.710> squeeze<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.859> together<00:00:31.180> now<00:00:32.180> it's<00:00:32.330> easier

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
just squeeze it together now it's easier

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750 
just squeeze it together now it's easier
actually<00:00:33.260> with<00:00:33.530> kitchen<00:00:34.160> foil<00:00:34.370> because<00:00:34.670> of

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
actually with kitchen foil because of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.400 
actually with kitchen foil because of
course<00:00:34.940> actually<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.300> will<00:00:35.360> be<00:00:35.480> longer<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
course actually it will be longer the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.689 
course actually it will be longer the
great<00:00:36.589> thing<00:00:36.769> about<00:00:36.800> this<00:00:37.160> is<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.519> can<00:00:37.670> just

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
great thing about this is you can just

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.180 
great thing about this is you can just
make<00:00:38.059> them<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.360> whatever<00:00:38.660> size<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.320> want<00:00:39.350> but

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
make them to whatever size you want but

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.520 
make them to whatever size you want but
if<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.400> take<00:00:40.640> maybe<00:00:40.879> around<00:00:41.839> about<00:00:41.989> 1/2<00:00:42.290> inch

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
if you take maybe around about 1/2 inch

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.020 
if you take maybe around about 1/2 inch
something<00:00:42.890> like<00:00:43.129> that<00:00:43.340> what<00:00:43.760> we're<00:00:43.879> going<00:00:44.000> to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
something like that what we're going to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.130 
something like that what we're going to
do<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.270> we're<00:00:44.390> going<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.539> be<00:00:44.629> bending<00:00:44.840> these

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
do is we're going to be bending these

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.080 
do is we're going to be bending these
over<00:00:45.620> just<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.039> create<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.399> different<00:00:46.940> type<00:00:47.059> of

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
over just to create a different type of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.330 
over just to create a different type of
curl<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.050> instead<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.500> idea<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:48.949> your

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
curl so instead of the idea that your

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.310 
curl so instead of the idea that your
hair<00:00:49.579> just<00:00:50.030> goes<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.570> wraps<00:00:50.840> around<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
hair just goes and wraps around the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.369 
hair just goes and wraps around the
bottom<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:52.160> heated<00:00:52.579> roller<00:00:52.850> or<00:00:53.210> some<00:00:54.199> other

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
bottom of a heated roller or some other

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.520 
bottom of a heated roller or some other
type<00:00:55.039> of<00:00:55.600> utensil<00:00:56.600> what<00:00:57.109> we're<00:00:57.230> going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.379> do

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
type of utensil what we're going to do

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.580 
type of utensil what we're going to do
here<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:57.890> we're<00:00:58.039> going<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.219> go<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:58.789> out<00:00:58.879> of

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
here is we're going to go in and out of

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.799 
here is we're going to go in and out of
the<00:01:00.590> of<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.489> shape<00:01:01.730> left<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.390> couple<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.719> these

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
the of the shape left a couple of these

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.540 
the of the shape left a couple of these
sections<00:01:03.260> out<00:01:03.440> just<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.890> show<00:01:04.039> you<00:01:04.100> exactly

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
sections out just to show you exactly

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.660 
sections out just to show you exactly
how<00:01:04.789> to<00:01:05.030> do<00:01:05.360> them<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.950> can<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.220> them<00:01:07.369> on<00:01:07.460> wet

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
how to do them so you can do them on wet

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.219 
how to do them so you can do them on wet
hair<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.090> actually<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:08.600> much<00:01:08.720> easier<00:01:09.170> if

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
hair but actually it's much easier if

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.710 
hair but actually it's much easier if
you<00:01:09.350> do<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.590> on<00:01:09.710> kind<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:09.979> damp<00:01:10.220> hair<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.910> it's

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
you do it on kind of damp hair and it's

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.890 
you do it on kind of damp hair and it's
even<00:01:12.200> easier<00:01:12.380> if<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.009> use<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:14.300> liquid

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
even easier if you use a liquid

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.260 
even easier if you use a liquid
volumizer<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:16.070> using<00:01:16.340> hair<00:01:16.640> raised<00:01:16.820> in<00:01:17.060> here

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
volumizer I'm using hair raised in here

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.289 
volumizer I'm using hair raised in here
and<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:18.259> can<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.640> soak<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.820> down<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:23.119> once

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
and you can just soak it down and once

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.830 
and you can just soak it down and once
you've<00:01:23.479> done<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.720> just<00:01:24.229> comb<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:25.340> through

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.429 

as<00:01:28.409> such<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:31.469> then<00:01:31.619> pop<00:01:32.039> in<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:33.259> piece<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
as such and then pop in your piece of

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.520 
as such and then pop in your piece of
foil<00:01:34.679> and<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> wind<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.259> backwards<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
foil and just wind it backwards and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700 
foil and just wind it backwards and
forwards<00:01:37.829> over<00:01:38.819> each<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.659> sections<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
forwards over each of the sections so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.440 
forwards over each of the sections so
you're<00:01:40.859> just<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.219> over<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> other

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
you're just going over one and the other

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.719 
you're just going over one and the other
so<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.079> idea<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.069> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.459> curl

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so the idea is is the kind of curl

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
so the idea is is the kind of curl
you're<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you're going to get is going to be in a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
you're going to get is going to be in a
sort<00:01:47.819> of<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:47.969> S<00:01:48.240> shape<00:01:48.929> now<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.280> have

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
sort of an S shape now you can have

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.949 
sort of an S shape now you can have
pretty<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.569> fun<00:01:51.719> with<00:01:51.840> this

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
pretty much a lot of fun with this

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.599 
pretty much a lot of fun with this
because<00:01:52.289> of<00:01:52.409> course<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:53.009> you've<00:01:53.219> got<00:01:53.369> very

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
because of course if you've got very

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.340 
because of course if you've got very
very<00:01:53.759> long<00:01:54.030> hair<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.329> could<00:01:54.689> take<00:01:54.899> great<00:01:55.109> big

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
very long hair you could take great big

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
very long hair you could take great big
sections<00:01:55.969> make<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.179> foil<00:01:57.450> slightly<00:01:57.959> thinner

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
sections make the foil slightly thinner

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.779 
sections make the foil slightly thinner
and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.859> you've<00:01:59.069> just<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.459> wrap<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
and you know you've just got to wrap it

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.359 
and you know you've just got to wrap it
around<00:01:59.849> quite<00:02:00.209> thickly<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.009> even

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
around quite thickly you can even

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.669 
around quite thickly you can even
actually<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.479> necessarily<00:02:04.110> useful<00:02:04.319> you

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
actually not necessarily useful you

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.440 
actually not necessarily useful you
could<00:02:04.829> even<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.250> pieces<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:07.610> fabric<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.329> in

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
could even use pieces of fabric and in

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.839 
could even use pieces of fabric and in
fact<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.649> down<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:11.310> role<00:02:11.519> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
fact you're then going down the role of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.699 
fact you're then going down the role of
pretty<00:02:12.599> much<00:02:12.780> kind<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.049> like<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> old-time

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
pretty much kind of like the old-time

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.520 
pretty much kind of like the old-time
rags<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.750> sleeping<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.870> them<00:02:16.049> so<00:02:16.260> that's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
rags of sleeping in them so that's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.670 
rags of sleeping in them so that's
another<00:02:16.769> way<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> getting<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:18.750> much<00:02:19.200> more<00:02:19.410> sort

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
another way of getting a much more sort

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.930 
another way of getting a much more sort
of<00:02:19.970> kind<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.950> stronger<00:02:22.950> effect<00:02:23.069> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.760> want

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
of kind of a stronger effect if you want

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.670 
of kind of a stronger effect if you want
to<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.239> be<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.870> know<00:02:24.900> leave<00:02:25.410> them<00:02:25.590> in

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
to kind of be in you know leave them in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.150 
to kind of be in you know leave them in
all<00:02:25.799> night

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
all night

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.949 
all night
now<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> ends<00:02:27.390> what<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.629> do<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.810> we've

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
now with the ends what we do is we've

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.360 
now with the ends what we do is we've
been<00:02:28.049> very<00:02:28.230> careful<00:02:28.739> about<00:02:28.829> trying<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> keep

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
been very careful about trying to keep

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.509 
been very careful about trying to keep
all<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.910> ends<00:02:30.180> very<00:02:30.390> very<00:02:31.160> smooth<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.459> I'm

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
all the ends very very smooth and I'm

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.120 
all the ends very very smooth and I'm
using<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.090> foil<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.750> hold<00:02:33.959> all<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:35.010> those

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
using the foil to just hold all of those

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.509 
using the foil to just hold all of those
in<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:35.639> can<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.980> kind<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
in so you can see you have that kind of

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.250 
in so you can see you have that kind of
shape<00:02:39.180> or<00:02:39.420> whether<00:02:39.569> you're<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:40.109> in

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
shape or whether you're just going in

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.870 
shape or whether you're just going in
and<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> great<00:02:41.220> thing<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.489> using

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and out now the great thing about using

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.819 
and out now the great thing about using
a<00:02:42.209> body<00:02:42.389> miser<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:43.019> course<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.590> need

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
a body miser is of course you don't need

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.069 
a body miser is of course you don't need
to<00:02:44.130> wait<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.579> too<00:02:45.030> much<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.420> water<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.900> dry

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
to wait for too much of the water to dry

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.309 
to wait for too much of the water to dry
so<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:47.250> works<00:02:47.519> very<00:02:47.819> very<00:02:47.970> well<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.959> fact

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
so what works very very well is in fact

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.339 
so what works very very well is in fact
if<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.120> even<00:02:51.269> use<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.930> pair<00:02:52.319> of

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
if you can you could even use a pair of

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.819 
if you can you could even use a pair of
ions<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:54.720> apply<00:02:54.989> some<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> heat<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
ions and just apply some of the heat and

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.319 
ions and just apply some of the heat and
of<00:02:55.889> course<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.579> know<00:02:56.669> being<00:02:56.940> foreign

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
of course you know being foreign

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.970 
of course you know being foreign
conducts<00:02:57.720> very<00:02:57.989> very<00:02:58.200> well<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.709> will

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
conducts very very well so that will

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740 
conducts very very well so that will
also<00:02:59.250> dry<00:02:59.489> very<00:02:59.760> very<00:02:59.970> quickly<00:03:00.209> as<00:03:00.419> well<00:03:00.599> so

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
also dry very very quickly as well so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.180 
also dry very very quickly as well so
that<00:03:00.870> would<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.139> help<00:03:01.169> it<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.130> course

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that would just help it on and of course

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.430 
that would just help it on and of course
if<00:03:02.430> you've<00:03:02.579> got<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> time<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.319> can

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
if you've got the time then you can

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.900 
if you've got the time then you can
allow<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.889> dry<00:03:05.069> naturally<00:03:05.549> or<00:03:05.579> put<00:03:05.880> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
allow them to dry naturally or put a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.759 
allow them to dry naturally or put a
hairdryer<00:03:06.329> with<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.569> diffuser<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.109> them<00:03:07.380> or

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
hairdryer with the diffuser on them or

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.770 
hairdryer with the diffuser on them or
as<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.549> may<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.150> those<00:03:09.329> old<00:03:09.510> who

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
as you may have one of those old who

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
as you may have one of those old who
drives<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.169> doubt<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.919> could<00:03:11.069> put<00:03:11.190> one

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
drives I doubt it but you could put one

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
drives I doubt it but you could put one
of<00:03:11.400> those<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.639> as<00:03:11.760> well<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.440> idea<00:03:13.470> being

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
of those on as well but the idea being

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.539 
of those on as well but the idea being
is<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.239> very<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.720> easy<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.290> do<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.590> so

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
is that it is very very easy to do it so

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.940 
is that it is very very easy to do it so
there<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.849> have<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.720> those<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.620> all

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
there you have it all of those so all

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.460 
there you have it all of those so all
they<00:03:20.340> need<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.669> do<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.120> drain<00:03:21.569> in<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.200> way<00:03:22.290> that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
they need to do is drain in the way that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.729 
they need to do is drain in the way that
I<00:03:22.500> said<00:03:22.620> either<00:03:23.099> by<00:03:23.340> air<00:03:23.970> drying<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.810> using<00:03:25.410> a

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
I said either by air drying or using a

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.800 
I said either by air drying or using a
dry<00:03:26.190> worded<00:03:26.459> diffuser<00:03:26.819> or<00:03:27.090> even<00:03:27.419> using<00:03:27.660> your

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
dry worded diffuser or even using your

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.180 
dry worded diffuser or even using your
styling<00:03:28.380> for<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.739> straightening<00:03:29.069> iron

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
styling for the straightening iron

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.059 
styling for the straightening iron
actually<00:03:29.940> apply<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.359> bit<00:03:30.569> more<00:03:30.780> heat<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.319> let's

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
actually apply a bit more heat so let's

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.200 
actually apply a bit more heat so let's
just<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.400> off<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.519> do<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
just go off and do that

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.970 
just go off and do that
we'll<00:03:33.390> come<00:03:33.540> back<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> second<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.770> now

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
we'll come back a second so this is now

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.310 
we'll come back a second so this is now
dried<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.510> we're<00:03:36.720> gonna<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.020> all<00:03:37.200> these

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
dried and we're gonna take all these

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:52.570 
dried and we're gonna take all these
rollers<00:03:37.650> out

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.730 

so<00:03:53.150> now<00:03:53.300> you've<00:03:53.600> seen<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.960> we've<00:03:54.140> taken<00:03:54.290> all

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
so now you've seen that we've taken all

which will give you a little bit more to

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.420 
which will give you a little bit more to
really<00:04:11.480> thoroughly<00:04:11.780> brushing<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.560> through<00:04:12.590> so

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
let's just make a start on some of those

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.039 
let's just make a start on some of those
I'm<00:04:15.410> going<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> start<00:04:15.860> somewhere<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:17.450> between

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
I'm going to start somewhere in between

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.350 
I'm going to start somewhere in between
I<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.470> rake<00:04:18.860> in<00:04:19.130> some<00:04:19.430> of<00:04:19.549> that<00:04:19.700> through<00:04:20.060> so

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
I just rake in some of that through so

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.300 
I just rake in some of that through so
you<00:04:20.420> can<00:04:20.510> see<00:04:20.900> already<00:04:21.080> we're<00:04:21.890> starting<00:04:22.190> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
you can see already we're starting to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.690 
you can see already we're starting to
create<00:04:22.520> quite<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.450> bit<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.860> volume<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:26.140> just<00:04:27.140> an

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
create quite a bit of volume and just an

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.380 
create quite a bit of volume and just an
interesting<00:04:28.700> type<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.690> curl<00:04:30.170> there<00:04:34.270> at<00:04:35.270> this

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
interesting type of curl there at this

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.870 
interesting type of curl there at this
point<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.840> think<00:04:35.900> I'm<00:04:36.170> just<00:04:36.350> going<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.850> put<00:04:37.850> a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
point I think I'm just going to put a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.690 
point I think I'm just going to put a
bit<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.330> creme<00:04:38.810> de<00:04:38.930> luxe<00:04:39.400> finishing<00:04:40.400> cream

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
just so that I can see some of that

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.560 
just so that I can see some of that
separation<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:46.550> also<00:04:46.790> just<00:04:47.120> keep<00:04:47.330> some

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
separation and then also just keep some

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.290 
separation and then also just keep some
of<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.810> shine<00:04:48.650> especially<00:04:48.920> around<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
of that shine especially around the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.060 
of that shine especially around the
hairline<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.840> can<00:04:51.050> see<00:04:51.290> just<00:04:51.500> as<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.800> put<00:04:52.040> that

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
hairline you can see just as I put that

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.050 
hairline you can see just as I put that
on<00:04:52.780> instantly<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:53.930> starts<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.790> break<00:04:55.790> up

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
on instantly it just starts to break up

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.090 
on instantly it just starts to break up
and<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.450> just<00:04:56.510> really<00:04:56.950> accentuating<00:04:57.950> and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
and it's just really accentuating and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.380 
and it's just really accentuating and
defining<00:04:58.870> those<00:04:59.870> wonderful<00:05:00.820> different<00:05:01.820> type

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
defining those wonderful different type

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.380 
defining those wonderful different type
of<00:05:02.419> curl<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:04.040> I'm<00:05:04.220> just<00:05:04.400> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.640> remove

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
of curl and I'm just going to remove

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:25.890 
of curl and I'm just going to remove
some<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.020> marks<00:05:06.470> that

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.330 

so<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:27.199> see<00:05:27.469> I<00:05:27.650> mean<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.830> can<00:05:28.099> play

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
so you can see I mean you can play

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.860 
so you can see I mean you can play
around<00:05:28.490> with<00:05:28.789> this<00:05:29.029> and<00:05:29.360> you<00:05:29.449> brush<00:05:29.689> it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
around with this and you brush it

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.510 
around with this and you brush it
through<00:05:29.900> but<00:05:30.590> it's<00:05:30.710> actually<00:05:31.039> kind<00:05:31.249> of<00:05:31.310> great

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
through but it's actually kind of great

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.640 
through but it's actually kind of great
just<00:05:31.819> when<00:05:31.969> it<00:05:32.090> just<00:05:32.270> has<00:05:32.419> that<00:05:32.449> long<00:05:32.840> tenderly

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
just when it just has that long tenderly

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.459 
just when it just has that long tenderly
you<00:05:34.340> know<00:05:34.460> almost<00:05:34.819> just<00:05:35.330> kind<00:05:35.569> of<00:05:35.659> slightly

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
you know almost just kind of slightly

00:05:36.469 --> 00:06:04.250
