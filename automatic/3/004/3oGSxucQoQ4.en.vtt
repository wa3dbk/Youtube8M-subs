00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.309
 hello to all my subscribers 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.500
 Welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.940
 how to accelerate the pc to run games 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.910
 current in any game in with better 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.560
 quality and fluidity at this time 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.090
 I'm going to do the solved answer to 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.430
 previous video that says it was not very 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.530
 very clarified how to do it 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.420
 and for that they will have this video already 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.180
 that many people asked me 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.670
 personal message like it was wrong 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.170
 I did not understand that you could not understand 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.960
 well the video so I bring you this 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.000
 new video I can do the test myself 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.629
 with a game that you just installed and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.559
 let this is that if it works really 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.809
 what they have to do is have the 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.190
 code like here I have it will the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.520
 description of the video is pasted on a pad 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.510
 of notes here can the name of the game 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 and here another is the name of the game 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.630
 executable 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 one thing I 'm not good this has to 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.770
 give it intact can not erase this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.770
 because without this it does not work 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.100
 now then you have to look for the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.610
 this game folder that goal that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.820
 I have 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.820
 in games just installed the avatar 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.590
 and you will find avatar 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.260
 then what we are going to do is in the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 green 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.970
 the file normal notepad files 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.590
 of notes by the name of the executable it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.280
 I discussed blÃ© is simply called 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.280
 avatar 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.470
 min 32 be 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 this leaves you restless in air and here 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.600
 they have by the name of the game avatar ex 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.550
 is the name of the file may vary 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 of the no of the executable file that 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.290
 have if they have for example the plan 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.440
 default or with the gta point of excel 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.500
 you have to check how the file is 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.930
 more effects any of these one thing 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.560
 that I want to clarify this what 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.320
 do is put put the cpu that you use 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.680
 all its power in the game that's why it's 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.900
 that put him in high good now what 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.510
 what we are going to do is record how 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.340
 save as they look again where 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.340
 they had the game we can 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.930
 but it's already here ping is saved 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.080
 they can put another avatar name too 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.020
 dot pack 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.660
 they keep it is in this type of file 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.350
 save 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.940
 there it was my turn to appear there is what 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.130
 let's send to the desk so that 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.900
 be a normal file 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 let's see 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.129
 our mind here is the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.010
 I want to be is properties that inter 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.200
 done property is another symbol 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.880
 we need let's find who 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.480
 found the same game folder and 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.340
 Exe executable file symbol 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.250
 accept ok 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.860
 apply ok we already have it as being a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.310
 execute is normal now to test if 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.310
 works 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.180
 at the moment as there is a small picture 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.650
 of the cmd if I was watching the game I do not know 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.170
 If the study program is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.490
 recording this but there it is working 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.490
 It remains in the game normally 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.720
 before a little faster 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 presents 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.150
 For this, normally he does not know how to leave 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.940
 and well you can do that with any 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.410
 another game is simple you just have to 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.090
 follow the steps of the video are not 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.760
 forget what I said do not eliminate this 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 just with the name the name here the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.230
 leave space sameness name 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.620
 Ex point game this works for all 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.620
 the games 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.380
