00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.540 
pistol I believe it is a pistol on the
Glock<00:03:45.300> platform<00:03:45.870> because<00:03:46.709> by<00:03:46.980> looking<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
Glock platform because by looking the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.040 
Glock platform because by looking the

shape I believe it can either be the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.420 
shape I believe it can either be the
Glock<00:03:51.330> 17<00:03:51.750> or<00:03:51.930> Glock<00:03:52.200> 18<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.340> also

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
Glock 17 or Glock 18 but it can also

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.210 
Glock 17 or Glock 18 but it can also
