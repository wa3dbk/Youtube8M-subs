sometimes<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:36.900> come<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

something new that actually worked out

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.980

I<00:01:41.729> thought<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> trucks<00:01:42.450> were<00:01:42.540> cool<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.930> were

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a little different the turning was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.710 
a little different the turning was
really<00:01:44.340> great<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> little

hard to get used to how easily and well

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100
