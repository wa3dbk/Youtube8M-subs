00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
your hair so I didn't figure I would

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sections like that and I would roll them

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
sections like that and I would roll them
up<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> hot<00:00:52.110> hot<00:00:52.530> sticks<00:00:53.000> first<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.449> mousse

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
actually started right here that's where

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.520 
actually started right here that's where
I<00:01:40.380> started<00:01:40.740> putting<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.130> hot<00:01:41.280> sticks<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
I started putting my hot sticks in and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.730 
I started putting my hot sticks in and
sometimes<00:01:44.299> I'll<00:01:45.299> start<00:01:46.110> from<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
sometimes I'll start from the top but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
sometimes I'll start from the top but
usually<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.490> these<00:01:48.420> hot<00:01:48.630> sticks<00:01:48.869> on

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
usually it's like these hot sticks on

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.210 
usually it's like these hot sticks on
the<00:01:49.049> bottom<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> start<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> top<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the bottom if you start from the top the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.410 
the bottom if you start from the top the
hot<00:01:50.369> sticks<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> bottom<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hot sticks on the bottom just kind of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.700 
hot sticks on the bottom just kind of
get<00:01:51.570> lost<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> middle<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.470> hair<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
get lost in the middle of your hair so I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.259 

just<00:02:12.260> kind<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.620> pull<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.340> out<00:02:13.580> sometimes<00:02:14.120> it

just kind of pull it out sometimes it

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.640 
just kind of pull it out sometimes it
gets<00:02:14.420> stuck<00:02:14.510> probably<00:02:15.079> not<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.319> best<00:02:15.349> way<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
gets stuck probably not the best way to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.179 
gets stuck probably not the best way to
take<00:02:15.920> hot<00:02:16.129> sticks<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.579> but<00:02:16.879> how<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.260> then

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
take hot sticks out but how I do it then

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.539 
take hot sticks out but how I do it then
you'll<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.579> this<00:02:20.390> kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.810> coal<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.549> I

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
you'll have this kind of coal and I

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.660 
you'll have this kind of coal and I
split<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.390> off<00:02:23.569> really<00:02:23.930> really<00:02:24.290> thin<00:02:25.099> section

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
split it off really really thin section

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.160 
split it off really really thin section
and<00:02:28.030> roll<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.239> up<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:33.019> you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
and roll it up like that and then you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
and roll it up like that and then you
get<00:02:33.349> little<00:02:34.250> crows<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.730> look<00:02:34.909> like<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:36.940> so

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
to fix my curls when I would flip them I

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.789 
to fix my curls when I would flip them I
would<00:04:13.560> take<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.370> would<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:16.560> that

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
would take it and I would like do that

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.660 
would take it and I would like do that
with<00:04:17.130> it

with it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.880 
with it
but<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.480> don't<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.200> way<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.500> looks<00:04:19.739> I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
but I don't like the way that looks I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.380 
but I don't like the way that looks I
like<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.130> more<00:04:20.850> luthier<00:04:21.390> curls<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.430> also

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
like the more luthier curls so and also

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.360 
like the more luthier curls so and also
when<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.660> used<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.260> fix<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.770> like<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:26.100> would

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
when I used to fix it like that would

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.550 
when I used to fix it like that would
just<00:04:26.400> like<00:04:26.820> twirl<00:04:27.210> my<00:04:27.330> finger<00:04:27.690> around<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.020> it

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
just like twirl my finger around it it

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.310 
just like twirl my finger around it it
would<00:04:28.770> make<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.850> really<00:04:30.120> crazy-looking<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.230> my

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
would make it really crazy-looking in my

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:56.390 
would make it really crazy-looking in my
hair<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.330> better

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.309 

didn't<00:04:57.400> have<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.759> first<00:04:58.710> two<00:04:59.710> positive<00:05:01.289> so<00:05:02.289> I

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
didn't have the first two positive so I

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.860 
didn't have the first two positive so I
am<00:05:02.979> going<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.819> take<00:05:04.030> all<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.569> rest<00:05:04.750> of

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
am going to take all of the rest of

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.300 
am going to take all of the rest of
these<00:05:05.020> out<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.409> just<00:05:05.650> do<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.069> same<00:05:06.280> way

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.219 
these out and just do it the same way
but<00:05:06.520> I'm<00:05:06.939> actually<00:05:07.120> going<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.509> start<00:05:08.080> with

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
but I'm actually going to start with

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.260 
but I'm actually going to start with
these<00:05:08.319> bottom<00:05:08.770> hop<00:05:08.949> sticks<00:05:09.310> because<00:05:09.879> like<00:05:10.150> I

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
these bottom hop sticks because like I

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.119 
these bottom hop sticks because like I
said<00:05:10.330> didn't<00:05:10.780> they<00:05:11.169> tend<00:05:11.439> to<00:05:11.469> get<00:05:11.620> lost<00:05:11.830> if<00:05:12.099> you

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
said didn't they tend to get lost if you

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.890 
said didn't they tend to get lost if you
start<00:05:12.969> from<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.180> top<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.389> work<00:05:13.689> your<00:05:13.719> way

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.360 
start from the top and work your way
down<00:05:14.069> so<00:05:15.069> I<00:05:15.340> will<00:05:16.000> be<00:05:16.120> back
