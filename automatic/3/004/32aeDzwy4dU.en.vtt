00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.780
 hi my name is brand viber 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.670
 chief creative designer in the studio mts 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.260
 I will talk about gaming experiences and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:25.490
 the improvements we made in this 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:27.320
 direction in hon 30 many players 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.149
 will experience a big problem in order to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.920
 understand this genre of game exactly 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.840
 we want to overcome this barrier by introducing 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.880
 new learning elements in hon 30 we 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.649
 added a learning passage introduced 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.140
 many changes to the casual game mode 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.850
 added a lire to the thorium teaching section 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.770
 where players can watch videos 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.520
 help to understand more 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.809
 game heroes of newerth 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.760
 what we wanted to achieve by creating 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.960
 learning passage simple 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.329
 cognitive path heroes of newerth 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.860
 which is designed to teach the basics of the game we 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.750
 did it combine learning 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.289
 playing hon against 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 bots following what we drew 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.039
 attention in creating a new game 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.329
 impressions this is a casual game mode he 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.280
 allows new players less 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.229
 get upset about in-game failures a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.819
 more experienced players get new 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.840
 impressions at a slightly different pace 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:31.819
 different from the standard game type and so 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.619
 among many other treason that we 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.329
 implemented whether I enter one of the main 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.929
 worth noting how it is calculated 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.979
 killing gold 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.840
 now this amount is calculated in 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.039
 depending on how successful 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.810
 the character being killed in the current game is 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.939
 designed to mitigate the irritation of the team 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.409
 if someone dies again and again after all 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.599
 each time for his killings will be 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.849
 give less and less gold and this 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.240
 may not lead to a crushing victory 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.240
 or defeat 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.140
