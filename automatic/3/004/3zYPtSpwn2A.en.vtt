cheerleader in seventh grade for about

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.120 
cheerleader in seventh grade for about
two<00:00:14.120> weeks<00:00:14.259> my<00:00:15.259> best<00:00:15.500> friend<00:00:15.799> was<00:00:15.950> on<00:00:16.070> the

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
two weeks my best friend was on the

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.760 
two weeks my best friend was on the
squad<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:16.730> she<00:00:17.539> talked<00:00:18.080> me<00:00:18.260> into<00:00:18.289> doing<00:00:18.529> it

squad and she talked me into doing it

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.470 
squad and she talked me into doing it
and<00:00:18.980> I<00:00:19.220> don't<00:00:19.580> think<00:00:19.820> that<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:19.970> lasted<00:00:20.420> very

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
and I don't think that I lasted very

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.060 
and I don't think that I lasted very
long<00:00:20.630> because<00:00:21.020> at<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.260> time<00:00:21.500> I<00:00:21.830> wasn't

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
long because at the time I wasn't

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.730 
long because at the time I wasn't
physically<00:00:22.640> committed<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.210> be<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.359> cheerleader

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
physically committed to be a cheerleader

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.779 
physically committed to be a cheerleader
my<00:00:24.740> perception<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.310> cheerleading<00:00:25.699> is

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
my perception of cheerleading is

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.939 
my perception of cheerleading is
completely<00:00:26.269> different<00:00:26.660> especially<00:00:27.439> with<00:00:27.650> the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
completely different especially with the

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.279 
completely different especially with the
overall<00:00:28.189> athleticism<00:00:28.849> I<00:00:29.359> didn't<00:00:30.050> know<00:00:30.109> that

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
overall athleticism I didn't know that

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.479 
overall athleticism I didn't know that
there<00:00:30.410> was<00:00:30.500> such<00:00:30.800> such<00:00:31.490> like<00:00:31.780> elite<00:00:32.780> athletes

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
there was such such like elite athletes

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.400 
there was such such like elite athletes
there<00:00:34.489> like<00:00:34.910> physically<00:00:35.950> like<00:00:37.329> gymnasts

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
there like physically like gymnasts

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.709 
there like physically like gymnasts
ninjas<00:00:39.410> or<00:00:40.370> something<00:00:40.760> like<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.480> so

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
ninjas or something like that it's so

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.170 
ninjas or something like that it's so
foreign<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.170> me<00:00:42.440> but<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:43.520> feels<00:00:43.820> really<00:00:44.000> close

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
foreign to me but it feels really close

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.520 
foreign to me but it feels really close
to<00:00:44.390> my<00:00:44.480> heart<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.110> it's<00:00:45.410> something

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
to my heart now and it's something

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.380 
to my heart now and it's something
that's<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.039> present<00:00:46.610> right<00:00:46.760> now<00:00:46.789> in<00:00:47.210> our

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
that's so present right now in our

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.709 
that's so present right now in our
generation<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.170> such<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.469> huge<00:00:48.920> thing<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:50.270> think

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
generation and such a huge thing I think

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.479 
generation and such a huge thing I think
that<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.840> competitive<00:00:51.350> cheering<00:00:51.710> world<00:00:51.949> has

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
that the competitive cheering world has

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.670 
that the competitive cheering world has
been<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.510> know<00:00:53.629> slowly<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.500> gradually

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
been you know slowly and gradually

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.450 
been you know slowly and gradually
getting<00:00:55.219> bigger<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.699> bigger<00:01:00.039> it's<00:01:01.039> really

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
getting bigger and bigger it's really

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.049 
getting bigger and bigger it's really
really<00:01:01.670> hardcore<00:01:02.980> athleticism<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.430> I've

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
really hardcore athleticism and I've

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.340 
really hardcore athleticism and I've
really<00:01:05.239> gotten<00:01:05.479> excited<00:01:05.840> about<00:01:05.960> getting<00:01:06.229> into

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
really gotten excited about getting into

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.440 
really gotten excited about getting into
the<00:01:06.530> mindset<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.010> what<00:01:07.820> makes<00:01:08.030> someone<00:01:08.240> that

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
the mindset of what makes someone that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.000 
the mindset of what makes someone that
driven<00:01:08.810> what<00:01:09.049> makes<00:01:09.229> someone<00:01:09.470> want<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.799> do

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
driven what makes someone want to do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.500 
driven what makes someone want to do
that<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.369> their<00:01:10.490> bodies<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> living<00:01:11.360> but

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
that to their bodies for a living but

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.420 
that to their bodies for a living but
what<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.900> what<00:01:12.110> does<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.380> need<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.950> that's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
what is what does that need and that's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.190 
what is what does that need and that's
one<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.760> things<00:01:13.939> that<00:01:14.119> we<00:01:14.210> explore<00:01:14.810> in

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
one of the things that we explore in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.830 
one of the things that we explore in
Hellcats<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:16.040> think<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.210> really<00:01:17.450> about<00:01:17.689> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
Hellcats I think it's really about the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.899 
Hellcats I think it's really about the
underestimation<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.860> cheerleaders<00:01:19.729> in

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
underestimation of cheerleaders in

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.090 
underestimation of cheerleaders in
general<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.020> think<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.500> really<00:01:21.830> step

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
general and I think that we really step

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.609 
general and I think that we really step
up<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:22.490> plate<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.540> really<00:01:23.840> show<00:01:24.170> that

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
up to that plate and we really show that

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.090 
up to that plate and we really show that
cheerleading<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:25.640> about<00:01:25.939> athleticism<00:01:26.420> and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
cheerleading is about athleticism and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.230 
cheerleading is about athleticism and
determination<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.310> lot<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.119> don't

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
determination a lot of that you don't

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.700 
determination a lot of that you don't
see<00:01:29.570> when<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.869> just<00:01:30.020> see<00:01:30.140> them<00:01:30.290> performing

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
see when you just see them performing

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.200 
see when you just see them performing
there's<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.040> lot<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.280> work<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.430> goes<00:01:31.729> into<00:01:31.970> it

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
there's a lot of work that goes into it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.760 
there's a lot of work that goes into it
and<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.420> hope<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:32.930> show<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.290> side<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.619> it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and I hope that we show that side of it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.800 
and I hope that we show that side of it
cheerleading<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.549> humongous<00:01:34.909> deal<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.720> I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
cheerleading is a humongous deal and I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.740 
cheerleading is a humongous deal and I
had<00:01:35.960> no<00:01:36.140> idea<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:36.680> think<00:01:37.159> if<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.270> do<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> good<00:01:38.570> job

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
had no idea I think if we do a good job

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.069 
had no idea I think if we do a good job
in<00:01:39.549> projecting<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.360> great<00:01:41.570> image<00:01:41.900> of

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079
