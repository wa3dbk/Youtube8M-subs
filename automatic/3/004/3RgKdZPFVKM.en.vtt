00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.580
 and for the other sector 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.580
 there is no margin 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.320
 finish 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.980
 me too 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 at the rate of nine minutes of the first 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.270
 cutting time 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270
 10 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.550
 children the exit of inter 1 place 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.800
 he did it follow hundred of stadium 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.670
 national of santiago chile 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.670
 nilmar 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.780
 it seems to me that those goals that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.300
 there is practically no need to comment on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.079
 are the images there for what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.239
 to be seen and analyzed 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.009
 I believe that the first mistake is evil 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.420
 control and notice that now we see in 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.509
 account in the repetition look at the control 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 from the fridge, see what he got out there 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.470
 when he wants to react and was later 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.610
 In fact, he realizes when he rotates 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.729
 mind that the law ball that lengthens 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.550
 wants to accelerate in the very astute bar very 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.310
 I live face 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.690
 a terrible mistake by joan herrera that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.300
 cost 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:35.910
 how much nine minutes 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.910
 the 100 of sandro goes up sacha 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.149
 out wait jorge shine dreamer 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.320
 in the first time that's why therefore 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.960
 the operations 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.910
 now we 820 sepulchral silence 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.470
 sepulchral in June so is a good 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.910
 recovery and look at the only thing that is 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 desando 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 receives very just from these plays 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.800
 perfect accelerates very well get even brand 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 the play tells you where to go 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.150
 the qualification and definition of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 first before the departure of johnny herrera 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.030
 with some luck it happens between 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.670
 legs but 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 an example of counterattack as it has 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.520
 what to be 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.950
 the doctor who came to the rival field 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.850
 and a very accurate ball for the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.110
 habilitation of sacha that for this 20 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.680
 unthought I wanted to say at 12 minutes 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.690
 that this match is 0-2 19 a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.430
 University of Chile said that 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.100
 that had been raising its level in the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.080
 national championship and also yesterday 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.330
 would give him a window with the triumph the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.560
 strongest on emelec who would say 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.320
 acha value to encourage nilmar running 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.100
 for the inter you must have the area for 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100
 prevent more 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.690
 in the park he fights with the devil that or 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.440
 be against the wind that does not go ball 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.450
 for loss is the 3 to 0 of the inter that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.090
 begins to liquidate early nilmar and the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.670
 3 to 0 for the inter 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.380
 an indecipherable guy where you're going to 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.100
 attack where they go 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.100
 same 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.770
 very very dangerous life on the outside after 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.240
 inside already 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.130
 when it has the precision that follow 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.380
 Adam to Pereira 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.080
 mts south of his pricks the ball just 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.960
 by the left here is going to appreciate better 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.080
 Mira has gained the position of 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.060
 reach to put the tip is a shoe 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.540
 to beat once again john herrera 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.310
 Error overconfidence guzmÃ¡n 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.310
 Pereira thought he already had to win 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.440
 that he had already won the position and not 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.290
 you can cross your foot for a 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.380
 man I insist indecipherable what is going to 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.380
 do 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.830
 taking off coast and in person wait 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.900
 Take a run or sacha inside 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.900
 to Libya and that only valdivia 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.000
 scored portalegre twister would return 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.840
 for the 4 to 0 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.840
 valdivia did it 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.110
 the counter feels very good awaits and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.270
 then explode to road three and look at the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.400
 bitter mesh like that is going to stop 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.990
 immediately charge the body towards 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.880
 outside and then he does the magic 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.280
 red pp entered who does not reach 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.340
 read here you see maybe it looks more 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.430
 clarity looks out not for 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.980
 inside and when hurry forces the captain 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.320
 from chile university to turn towards the 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.300
 opposite side and then john herrera me 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.979
 it seems that he also has a share of 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.940
 of responsibility in that goal that 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.880
 passes between the middle of the legs 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.770
 I celebrate as Jorge Valldivia with his hand 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.110
 In the eyes 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.669
 valdivia the number 29 that notes its eighth 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.410
 goal for the inter's first tee 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.410
