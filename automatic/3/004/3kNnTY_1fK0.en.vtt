00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.660

 How are you welcome to Carlos? 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 kitchen we are in china cnn today 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.090
 from the restaurant daring making some 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.090
 poor rich look 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.129
 an important way is to celebrate 18 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.960
 is to have the best ones as we are going to start 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.000
 with the first important thing to have a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.829
 good to see who and when he spoke a good 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
 see who is important to have a 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.760
 rich smell of smoke that you would get 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.040
 cilantro a little salt I put a little 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.449
 in the center I also have tomato 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.400
 dehydrated that hydrate with water 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.470
 boiling it finite boil 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.920
 fresh traditional tomato cut into 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.920
 squares 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.089
 and we mix everything well 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.679
 onion 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.679
 in this case I put purple onion 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.500
 and I'm going to put vinegar is flavored 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.500
 with thyme 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.490
 and we ended up putting a trickle of 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 olive oil 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.520
 and we have our first poor ready 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.050
 second worse then this is going to be a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 little more Mediterranean and we will occupy 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.420
 Roasted eggplants 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.820
 Italian pumpkin that gets it in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.050
 squares in the microwave 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.050
 red paprika 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.370
 yes a led that we find a lot today 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.260
 everywhere 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.260
 vinegar this time with rosemary 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.370
 let's also put a spoonful of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 oil and look at nuances with garlic and 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.090
 chilote 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 love salt 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.400
 peppers 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.600
 not all have to be spicy is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.600
 spicy so this we 're going to do 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 we follow then with one of the most 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.750
 simple let's start by putting pretty 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.500
 chopped cilantro 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 onion 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.450
 vinegar but this time a good vinegar 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.710
 balsamic 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.210
 you have to invest suddenly in good 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.240
 vinegars 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.500
 let's put a little salt I'm going to 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.720
 do now I'm going to put the cacho goat 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.330
 in a bowl with half a kilo 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.280
 and I add boiling water and what I'm going to 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.280
 to occupy is the water resulting from this 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.990
 process 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 if it is fixed in the water it is taking a tone 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.920
 more reddish what are we going to do now 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 add this water eye with the seeds 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 we mix well you can put a little bit of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 tomato if they want but I like it 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.390
 only with onion cilantro and this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.640
 infusion that we made of catoca doran that 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.770
 only in the credit we go for the fourth 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.650
 option then let's pour with a 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.580
 technique of making cooked chili 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.319
 completely with boiling water to 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.290
 that is softer chopped in 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.599
 squares we put tomato of course 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.879
 cilantro infaltable in our town 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.879
 Chilean and are a little onion 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.790
 let's put a more neutral oil than 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.390
 it was canola oil that both 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.580
 we recommend here at carlo cocina 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.810
 and I will be generous let's put 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.770
 Pepper 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.230
 Salt 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.230
 and a little touch of vinegar with garlic 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.730
 we mix well 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.590
 and with the green chili look how beautiful the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.090
 colors that starts to take this we have 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.220
 finished then do these first 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.959
 4 pÃ©rez remember that we are going to do 4 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.370
 more so that you have an alternative to what 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.840
 better a simple lettuce salad 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.280
 like the one that I have here can 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.410
 continue in a different way with the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.790
 parents do not occupy the worst only 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.930
 to eat them company 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.930
 I see it here in Carlos cooking 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.120
 and what you still need to suck 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.120
 that cause me san carlos de apoquindo 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.860
 or beach for many the best cuisine in the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.860
 world 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.860
 we present
