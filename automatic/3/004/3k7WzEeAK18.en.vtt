 the mask comes sealed and comes with its 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.600

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.320
 little piece of paper comes in from the mask and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.509
 the transplant gel and the one of the three 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 natural what I've seen that in the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:34.460
 copies comes here the code itself 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.460
 bar or are on the label is many 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.340
 Sometimes it also comes inside the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.530
 mask now if they could be satisfied with 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.050
 its the person who is buying if not 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.500
 they want to buy directly in the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.230
 unique website 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.570
 and they want to buy in mexico they have to 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.670
 ask people to teach them the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.260
 box as the box comes because here it is 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.360
 the box for example the box where when 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.670
 they send it there is a nick comes a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.280
 box and to see how it comes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.729
 packaging comes with june paper and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.770
 comes with bubble paper inside 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.430
 the masks come 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 while the mask comes with in 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.080
 French and in English and it's a little bit 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 spoken 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.880
 the stable case is not this is not 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.480
 everything completely flat has here as 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.470
 that this one fold then another way 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.070
 who also did that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.850
 the imitation in the invitation this comes 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.250
 flat now also the gel of 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.350
 gel transplant the de jon and the original 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:49.010
 does not come with smell and yet in the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.230
 imitation smells charpy then this is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.909
 It is very important that you check it for 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.920
 that they are not going to put with their eyes that 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.260
 are going to hurt and not go to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.290
 to think that nicklas that damage because I neither 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.959
 that is a very good product this are 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.440
 natural products as I comment 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:10.489
 so if this is with this the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.569
 mask is worth 505 500 thousand 500 pesos more 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 150 pesos of shipping then this one when 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.730
 It suits them to buy more than 4 so that 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.440
 can be saved from shipping and power and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.299
 be able to sell those for now so 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.840
 accounts that enters Mexico the limit 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:31.280
 there are three thousand pesos a day there is no minimum 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.709
 but the shipping is 150 pesos a form of 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.849
 work and buy more expensive excesses 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.639
 is buying and making a meeting with 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.739
 a representative and the representative 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.170
 can help you collect points 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.840
 against in commissions and been doing 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.420
 calculations and from that of the fourth 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.069
 purchase that you do already have a lot 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.439
 free product 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.719
 they have product of price rather and 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.909
 they have troops they can use 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.459
 to buy other products too 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.030
 so they know that the product is half 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.670
 of price no matter the cost can be 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.400
 a collection that comes with your briefcase and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.469
 comes with this one with the masks and with 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.319
 other products that these are worth as 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.449
 three thousand pesos in half discounts 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.639
 that are are this 1500 then no 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.449
 it matters if it's a mask worth 500 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.190
 weights or if it's a collection of three thousand 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.960
 weights if you have a product halfway through 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.000
 price they give you the one they give the discount 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.770
 Well , that's all I want 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.139
 comment on any doubt if they have 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.180

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.490
 important 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.100
 the safety of the eyes then yes 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.259

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.690
 a representative of unique in the store 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.120
 virtual de unite products dotcom 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.560
 in my case silvia vilchis but if 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.690
 you want a representative that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.669

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.229
 This product has all code of 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.509
 bars but and victimization is that 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 they come exactly the same then one 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.910
 The way I told you is to review the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.250
 tag that comes in French in English 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.539
 and soon he came in Spanish until 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.020
