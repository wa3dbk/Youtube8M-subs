00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
probably preface the next step so to get

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.480 
probably preface the next step so to get
this<00:05:29.450> in<00:05:29.660> about<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.320> awkward<00:05:30.740> piece<00:05:30.980> off<00:05:31.250> you

this section where this cable is coming

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.140 
this section where this cable is coming
up<00:06:09.860> through<00:06:10.100> you<00:06:10.880> have<00:06:11.030> to<00:06:11.150> pull<00:06:11.990> out<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:13.190> up

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.790 
up through you have to pull out and up
the<00:06:14.510> problem<00:06:14.960> is<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.560> cigarette

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
the problem is that the cigarette

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.600 
the problem is that the cigarette
lighter<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:17.870> cigarette<00:06:18.260> lighters<00:06:18.650> how<00:06:19.310> to<00:06:19.370> be

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
lighter the cigarette lighters how to be

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.760 
lighter the cigarette lighters how to be
disconnected<00:06:20.060> from<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.540> back<00:06:20.750> and<00:06:21.140> there's<00:06:21.710> a

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
disconnected from the back and there's a

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.940 
disconnected from the back and there's a
very<00:06:21.950> little<00:06:22.490> slack<00:06:22.910> on<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:23.720> wire<00:06:23.960> so<00:06:24.919> you

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
very little slack on the wire so you

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.920 
very little slack on the wire so you
can't<00:06:25.340> pull<00:06:25.550> it<00:06:25.580> out<00:06:25.729> very<00:06:25.940> far<00:06:26.240> on<00:06:26.510> top<00:06:26.720> of

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
can't pull it out very far on top of

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.630 
can't pull it out very far on top of
that<00:06:27.080> this<00:06:27.550> piece<00:06:28.550> here<00:06:30.340> keeps<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:31.490> from

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
that this piece here keeps you from

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.370 
that this piece here keeps you from
being<00:06:31.820> able<00:06:31.940> to<00:06:32.120> pull<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.600> unit<00:06:32.930> all<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.260> way

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
being able to pull this unit all the way

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.140 
being able to pull this unit all the way
out<00:06:33.560> as<00:06:34.010> far<00:06:34.220> as<00:06:34.250> you<00:06:34.430> need<00:06:34.580> to<00:06:34.640> so<00:06:34.790> it's<00:06:35.090> a

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
out as far as you need to so it's a

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.520 
out as far as you need to so it's a
little<00:06:35.270> tricky<00:06:35.479> to<00:06:35.810> get<00:06:35.930> the<00:06:36.140> cigarette

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
little tricky to get the cigarette

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.670 
little tricky to get the cigarette
lighter<00:06:37.780> things<00:06:38.780> unhooked<00:06:39.229> on<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.500> back
