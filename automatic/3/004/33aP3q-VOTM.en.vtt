00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
still on closed open maps like like

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.320 
still on closed open maps like like
countdown<00:06:49.620> work<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:49.980> spawn<00:06:50.220> trapped<00:06:50.550> it

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
countdown work and spawn trapped it

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.090 
countdown work and spawn trapped it
really<00:06:51.570> doesn't<00:06:52.140> draw<00:06:52.290> and<00:06:52.650> you<00:06:52.980> know

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
really doesn't draw and you know

really doesn't draw and you know
director<00:06:53.670> those<00:06:54.120> comes<00:06:54.480> then<00:06:55.350> you<00:06:55.380> have<00:06:55.650> to

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
director those comes then you have to

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.980 
director those comes then you have to
factor<00:06:56.160> an<00:06:56.280> idea<00:06:56.610> that<00:06:56.880> this<00:06:57.090> my<00:06:57.720> team<00:06:57.960> is

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990
