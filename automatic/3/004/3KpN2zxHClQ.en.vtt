 games like ava cs o bp and many others

 the tests carried out they last for two 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.160
 to three days under the constant use games 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.590
 each battery is enough to connect the cable 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.110
 usb at the bottom of the mouse and load it up 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 even while playing good by summarizing the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.530
 opinion on the product he was one of the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.470
 best bad guys that ever went through my 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.329
 hands standing out by the footprint and style 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.670
 as well as numerous resources that he 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.590
 offers the players but the main one is the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.120
 confidence that the mouse passes even though 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.769
 I can say that this 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.329
 equipment was the first in years that 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.549
 It really made me afraid to use a 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.709
 wireless device to play and so 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.570
 shows that the main objective of 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.640
 glory in creating a wireless mouse with 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.500
 performance just like the bad ones I trust was 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.359
 really achieved during a long 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.160
 period of testing I did not notice a 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.630
 negative point on the product 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.579
 even when put to the test 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.709

 performance without losing one thousandth with 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.920
 communication delay to know how to 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.420
