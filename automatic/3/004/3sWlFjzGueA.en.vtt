00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 hi pilots in this issue we 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.970
 tell you about the equipment and ammunition you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.309
 learn the difference between tapes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.490
 and how to shoot down planes with rockets and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.490
 by bombs 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.280
 to man your airplane 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 ammunition and extra 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.170
 equipment you need to go to the tab 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.850
 service can be opened here 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.190
 several additional menus and 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.040
 familiarize yourself with the equipment options 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.180
 we will study in more detail without what the plane is 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.470
 can go to battle 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.380
 ammunition ribbons have two parameters 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 damage is recorded as an interval 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.090
 the smaller figure is the damage per second by 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.250
 maximum distance weapons 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.640
 more when shooting point blank 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.800
 chance to cause a fire, this important point 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.650
 probability not for a single bullet or 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.470
 projectile a base chance second salvo 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.260
 Provided that the entire queue hit the tank 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.720
 completely basic he is because u tank in 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.659
 depending on the design there is a big 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.210
 or less likely to catch fire 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.830
 damage module it increases in 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.409
 one and a half times in the world of warplanes 7 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.049
 types of tapes standard armor-piercing 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.630
 incendiary armor-piercing with a core 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.270
 armor-piercing incendiary high-explosive 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.130
 and shrapnel burner on and none 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.159
 nation can't use full 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.649
 spectrum but standard armor piercing and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.460
 incendiary tapes available for all 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.110
 guns and machine guns of all countries in the game 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.299
 standard tape is issued by default 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.450
 damage in the characteristics of weapons 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.549
 these cartridges are registered for him and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.060
 shells have no extra 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.170
 properties the main advantage is the price they are 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
 cheaper than all incendiary tape she has 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.560
 lowest damage 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.079
 Well, but there is a high chance to set fire 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 enemy aircraft last species 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.909
 ammunition accessible to all 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 armor piercing shells they can not set fire 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.670
 the plane but do more damage 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.150
 than standard and incendiary 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.730
 other tapes 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.800
 these are options on a given topic of difference 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.170
 There is a ratio of damage and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.510
 a chance to cause a fire between these 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.540
 parameters there is a feedback 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.490
 the higher 1 the lower the other for example 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.220
 armor piercing tape core 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.190
 there is a high explosive damage 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 a little less but when using it 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.540
 it is possible to set fire 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.120
 the opponent of this rule is only 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 one exception 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.630
 fragmentation incendiary tape 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.940
 superior in damage to purely incendiary 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.280
 and simultaneously has the highest 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.120
 all types of ammunition chance to cause 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.310
 fire so is so expensive to be 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.830
 note that tape type only affects 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.380
 damage accuracy and overheating 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:05.260
 the trunk does not depend on it the next 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.810
 item suspended weapons for bombs and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 missiles main characteristics are damage and 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.990
 blast radius 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.660
 thanks to the second parameter by these 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.940
 ammunition can be destroyed not only 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.690
 ground objects but also airplanes 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.060
 adversary 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.670
 for example the attack aircraft goes above ground on 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.700
 low - level flight hangs on his tail 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.430
 enemy attack aircraft drops the bomb they all 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.620
 triggered with some delay for these 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.200
 few seconds attack goes ahead 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.080
 and the fighter on the contrary falls into the zone 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.600
 blast wave defeats of course it's in 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.700
 ideally, most often the enemy has time to go to 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.770
 side but it does not cancel the fact 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.380
 What is such a catch? 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.810
 not just an exciting sport, but one of 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.830
 few opportunities for attack aircraft 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.050
 get rid of the annoying pursuer 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.640
 unlike rocket bombs when touching with 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.860
 target explode immediately 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.440
 and if you shoot into space with 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.530
 a delay of a few seconds to beat them 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.000
 opponents can be in different ways 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 enemy 's plane goes low above the ground 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.530
 then we shoot in front of him if he 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.800
 will be in the blast radius will be 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.290
 destroyed 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.550
 very interesting opportunity 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.670
 use rockets in combat at the height 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.239
 it all depends on the playerâ€™s skills 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.290
 but not only with experience 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 only a few can be advised 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.300
 basic things to shoot down a rocket 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.520
 the plane going to the cut should be good 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 feel her speed and right 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 taking lead is much easier to do 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.230
 this in a frontal attack or sitting on the tail 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.160
 release several missiles it 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.630
 will increase the chance to destroy the enemy. 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.790
 prediction is calculated for the most 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.950
 large cannon or machine gun 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.740
 weapons installed on the aircraft 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.870
 therefore not suitable for rockets they fly 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.120
 much slower than bullets and shells 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.340
 the distance that missiles go to 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.380
 explosion differs depending on 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.820
 models 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.370
 experiment or look for the exact 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.370
 information on the world of warplanes forum 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.159
 now consider the gear in principle 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.210
 the plane can go to battle without it 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.849
 although with him much more comfortable and more pleasant 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.319
 everything is very simple and clear 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.259
 the equipment description gives a complete 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.740
 characteristic of its properties gasoline 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.180
 used as soon as you enter the battle 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.490
 automatic fire extinguishing works 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.270
 if there is a fire, everything else 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.340
 equipment 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.620
 manually controlled to his 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.169
 use need to press a key 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.629
 what depends on the cell in which it is 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.219
 installed after which equipment is needed 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.349
 purchase again 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.650
 if you tick it 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.669
 be done automatically on it all good luck 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.669
 in battle
