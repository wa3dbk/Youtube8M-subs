00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
cables apart before you actually start

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
cables apart before you actually start
to<00:00:43.170> put<00:00:43.289> them<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.589> because<00:00:43.699> they<00:00:44.699> seem<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:45.030> get

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to put them in because they seem to get

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.899

well<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.880> what<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.540> first<00:02:34.019> did<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.500> plugged<00:02:34.799> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
well if what I first did is I plugged it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.470 
well if what I first did is I plugged it
into<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.510> one<00:02:36.720> which<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.620> wrong<00:02:37.799> one<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
into that one which is the wrong one I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
into that one which is the wrong one I
realized<00:02:39.480> even<00:02:39.660> though<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> says<00:02:40.200> audit<00:02:40.620> audio

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
realized even though it says audit audio

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
realized even though it says audit audio
in<00:02:41.610> that's<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.750> only<00:02:42.870> PCs<00:02:43.350> which<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> looked

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
in that's for only PCs which so I looked

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.860 
in that's for only PCs which so I looked
at<00:02:46.410> more<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.010> helper<00:02:48.000> Tyrian<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.630> want<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
at more of the helper Tyrian you want to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.500 
at more of the helper Tyrian you want to
plug<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.200> into<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.530> headphones<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.730> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
plug it into the headphones because you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.180 
plug it into the headphones because you
can't<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.019> can't<00:02:52.290> plug<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.799> into<00:02:52.950> any

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
can't and you can't plug it into any

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.030 
can't and you can't plug it into any
other<00:02:53.370> colored<00:02:53.790> ones<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.390> won't<00:02:54.570> fit

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
other colored ones because it won't fit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.199 
other colored ones because it won't fit
so<00:02:56.040> after<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:58.250> pretty<00:02:59.250> much<00:02:59.340> you're

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
so after that's in pretty much you're

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.440 
so after that's in pretty much you're
all<00:03:00.299> set<00:03:00.540> up<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.930> mean<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:02.220> black<00:03:02.820> ops<00:03:03.090> going
