00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.720
 present this that you see here that is two 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.720
 oranges 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.930
 is Ã¡vila 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.360
 and also 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.140
 1 good pair half of prickly pear 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.870
 to 2 good lemons are two pieces but 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 I'm just going to occupy one okay all 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.230
 this we are going to beat in the blender 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.590
 and then we're not going to take it this is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.590
 this is a smoothie what serves 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.020
 whether you feel like a little 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.670
 tired helps you in the joints 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.350
 of blood also serves to 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.649
 It serves to keep one more hair 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.479
 nice serves you in many ways is a 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.920
 natural product that really gets it 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.869
 I recommend 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.580
 The truth is that I like it a lot 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.030
 because it does not taste very ugly 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.550
 but it is very good for health there 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 I'm going to make them 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.860
 I will explain with that attitude for what 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 It serves is my first video that recorded the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.360
 I really do not know how to explain it 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.640
 but I'm going to put them there I'm going to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 put on youtube abajito I'm going to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.800
 explain why for what other 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.140
 things are more useful but it is very good 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.960
 I recommend everyone is something natural not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.400
 has chemical does not have anything only 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.810
 this sequel so that it does not go through 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.490
 another side in the little seeds and go 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.549
 to give an ugly taste to 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 to liquefied that we are going to do because 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:01.390
 I hope you enjoy it there is only 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 I'm just going to occupy this little bit of 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 I'll chop this bit of cactus 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 right now in small pieces and the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.239
 Aloe only occupies a piece 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.040
 little bit of a bit look ok is what 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.579
 only one that occupies 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.030
 and we are going to continue mixing this we are going 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:28.360
 to see box horita 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 you have to recognize does not know this ugly 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.600
 true that I thought it would be ugly but 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.810
 the truth is that I 'm taking it 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.040
 because it has served me a little I had already 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.599
 tremendous pains in the back 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.910
 This was recommended by my mom I love her 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.760

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'm going to apply in small pieces not 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 I can chop it well because I bring the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.680

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:30.890
