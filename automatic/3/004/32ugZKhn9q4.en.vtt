starts<00:01:57.899> first<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.040> one

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
starts first of all that's that's one

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.569 
starts first of all that's that's one
plus<00:01:59.430> point<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> downfall<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
plus point for it and the downfall so

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
plus point for it and the downfall so
the<00:02:02.700> trade-off<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> damaged<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the trade-off of that is damaged so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
the trade-off of that is damaged so
things<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> m4<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.969> m42<00:02:06.689> damage<00:02:07.049> per

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
things like the m4 the m42 damage per

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.779 
things like the m4 the m42 damage per
bullet<00:02:07.320> close<00:02:08.160> range

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
bullet close range

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.750 
bullet close range
and<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.539> C&amp;I<00:02:10.959> no<00:02:11.019> one<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.560> 49<00:02:12.159> ACR<00:02:13.000> 45<00:02:13.719> AK<00:02:14.500> 47<00:02:15.159> 49

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and the C&amp;I no one is 49 ACR 45 AK 47 49

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.920 
and the C&amp;I no one is 49 ACR 45 AK 47 49
the<00:02:16.510> fan<00:02:16.719> is<00:02:16.840> only<00:02:16.959> 30<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.629> it's<00:02:19.629> very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the fan is only 30 so it's it's very

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.860 
the fan is only 30 so it's it's very
very<00:02:20.170> weak<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.859> it<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.340> weakest<00:02:21.909> gun<00:02:22.180> other

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
very weak it is it the weakest gun other

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.839 
very weak it is it the weakest gun other
than<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.500> think<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.980> might<00:02:24.069> may<00:02:24.219> be<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.459> weakest

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
than I think it might may be the weakest

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.339 
than I think it might may be the weakest
gun<00:02:25.000> close<00:02:25.209> range<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.780> entire<00:02:26.019> game<00:02:26.200> I

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
gun close range in the entire game I

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.690 
gun close range in the entire game I
didn't<00:02:26.560> realize<00:02:26.829> that<00:02:26.859> until<00:02:27.099> just<00:02:27.340> reading

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
didn't realize that until just reading

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.630 
didn't realize that until just reading
this<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.379> think<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.920> pretty<00:02:30.099> much<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.280> one

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
this but I think it pretty much is one

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.979 
this but I think it pretty much is one
of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.790> weekends<00:02:31.180> apartment<00:02:31.599> on<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.720> machine

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
of the weekends apartment on the machine

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.839 
of the weekends apartment on the machine
pistols<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.500> pistols<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.069> think<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.609> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
pistols and the pistols I think it's the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.020 
pistols and the pistols I think it's the
weakest<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.239> second<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.109> firm<00:02:35.680> sorry<00:02:35.889> so<00:02:36.879> it's

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
weakest the second a firm sorry so it's

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.089 
weakest the second a firm sorry so it's
a<00:02:37.180> 30<00:02:37.480> damage<00:02:37.720> per<00:02:37.930> bullet<00:02:38.079> close<00:02:38.470> range<00:02:38.799> and

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
a 30 damage per bullet close range and

a 30 damage per bullet close range and
24<00:02:39.969> long<00:02:40.269> range<00:02:40.510> meaning<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.139> for<00:02:41.469> Bullock

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
24 long range meaning it's for Bullock

something like the m4 which in my

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460 
something like the m4 which in my
opinion<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.450> probably<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.930> biggest

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
opinion is probably the biggest

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.159 
opinion is probably the biggest

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
one more bullet which is actually quite

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.220 
one more bullet which is actually quite
huge<00:02:57.519> however<00:02:58.239> there's<00:02:58.659> always<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.900> trade-off

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
huge however there's always a trade-off

been subscribe to me for a while

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.080 
been subscribe to me for a while
basically<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.220> fad<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.639> mixture<00:03:37.000> between

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
basically the fad is a mixture between

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.339 
basically the fad is a mixture between
the<00:03:37.449> salt<00:03:37.659> rifle<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.949> submachine<00:03:39.489> gun<00:03:39.669> and

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
the salt rifle and a submachine gun and

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.899 
the salt rifle and a submachine gun and
so<00:03:41.349> submachine<00:03:41.859> gun<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.549> some<00:03:42.760> Bush

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
so submachine gun is like some Bush

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.059 
so submachine gun is like some Bush
submachine<00:03:43.629> gun<00:03:43.750> rate<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.109> fire<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.650> they're

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
submachine gun rate of fire and they're

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.210 
submachine gun rate of fire and they're
kind<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.609> close<00:03:45.849> range<00:03:46.349> sort<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.440> dominant<00:03:47.889> but

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
kind of close range sort of dominant but

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.649 
kind of close range sort of dominant but
it<00:03:48.340> has<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> sort<00:03:48.909> wife<00:03:49.060> all<00:03:49.269> sort<00:03:49.449> of<00:03:49.479> long

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
it has a sort wife all sort of long

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.009 
it has a sort wife all sort of long
range<00:03:49.690> if<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.319> makes<00:03:50.500> sense<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:52.389> hotronix

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
range if that makes sense the hotronix

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.300 
range if that makes sense the hotronix
play<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.500> about<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.889> second<00:03:54.220> but

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
play a little about in a second but

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.360 
play a little about in a second but
basically<00:03:54.639> this<00:03:55.569> is<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:56.049> very<00:03:56.290> low<00:03:57.010> very<00:03:57.069> cool

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
basically this is a very low very cool

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.969 
basically this is a very low very cool
gun<00:03:57.609> if<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.849> use<00:03:57.939> it<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.209> kick<00:03:58.479> so<00:03:59.260> it's<00:03:59.919> a

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
gun if you use it with kick so it's a

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.500 
gun if you use it with kick so it's a
bit<00:04:00.069> of<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.189> beast<00:04:00.370> by<00:04:00.909> using<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.150> kicking<00:04:01.419> it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
bit of a beast by using a kicking it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.580 
bit of a beast by using a kicking it
either<00:04:01.720> way<00:04:01.900> I'll<00:04:02.049> actually<00:04:02.229> don't<00:04:02.470> think

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
either way I'll actually don't think

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.839 
either way I'll actually don't think
about<00:04:02.680> anything<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:03.069> this<00:04:03.189> note<00:04:03.489> know<00:04:03.669> where

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
about anything on this note know where

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.469 
about anything on this note know where
proficiency<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.939> Phantom<00:04:07.359> my

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
proficiency it but the Phantom my

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.360 
proficiency it but the Phantom my
opinion<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.680> really<00:04:08.949> is<00:04:09.040> one<00:04:09.189> of<00:04:09.280> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
opinion is it really is one of the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.039 
opinion is it really is one of the
stronger<00:04:09.819> guns<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.269> game<00:04:10.449> because<00:04:10.689> it

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
stronger guns in the game because it

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.479 
stronger guns in the game because it
still<00:04:11.590> seems<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.919> kill<00:04:12.099> people<00:04:12.220> rather

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
still seems to kill people rather

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.860 
still seems to kill people rather

strong close-range college because it's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.129

it<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.330> just<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.660> general<00:04:24.050> dominant<00:04:24.620> gun<00:04:24.770> close

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
it is just a general dominant gun close

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.430 
it is just a general dominant gun close

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
range mid-range it's a beast against an

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.050

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
assault rifle with high fire rate which

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.240 
assault rifle with high fire rate which
is<00:04:29.090> all<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.450> can<00:04:29.570> really<00:04:29.660> ask<00:04:29.870> for<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.290> it's

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
is all you can really ask for and it's

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.700 
is all you can really ask for and it's
it's<00:04:31.790> only<00:04:32.000> real<00:04:32.180> how<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.960> can<00:04:33.200> compare<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.590> with

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
it's only real how I can compare it with

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.490 
it's only real how I can compare it with
a<00:04:34.190> submachine<00:04:34.850> gun<00:04:35.300> because<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.660> RCS<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.200> like<00:04:36.350> a

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
a submachine gun because I RCS is like a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.530 
a submachine gun because I RCS is like a
hybrid<00:04:36.860> between<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.120> basic<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.450> the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
hybrid between it this is basic like the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.450 
hybrid between it this is basic like the
p90<00:04:39.080> being<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.410> submachine<00:04:39.890> gun<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.280> sub

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
p90 being a submachine gun that the sub

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.230 
p90 being a submachine gun that the sub
the<00:04:40.940> p90<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.420> weaker<00:04:42.140> than<00:04:42.170> most<00:04:42.500> it's<00:04:43.340> damages

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
the p90 is weaker than most it's damages

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.120 
the p90 is weaker than most it's damages
very<00:04:44.480> low<00:04:44.660> but<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:44.960> p<00:04:45.080> 90<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.740> mightbe<00:04:45.770> is

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
very low but the p 90 it mightbe is

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.680 
very low but the p 90 it mightbe is
still<00:04:46.310> one<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.610> strongest<00:04:47.000> because<00:04:47.570> it

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
still one of the strongest because it

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.360 
still one of the strongest because it
has<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.810> higher<00:04:48.200> fire<00:04:48.500> ray<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.920> bigger<00:04:49.130> clip

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
has a higher fire ray and bigger clip

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.850 
has a higher fire ray and bigger clip
because<00:04:49.580> in<00:04:49.760> my<00:04:50.150> opinion<00:04:50.350> having<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.560> larger

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
because in my opinion having a larger

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.260 
because in my opinion having a larger
clip<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.280> fire<00:04:52.490> rate<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.820> probably<00:04:53.120> more

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
clip and fire rate is probably more

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.580 
clip and fire rate is probably more
important<00:04:53.630> than<00:04:53.690> damage<00:04:54.050> because<00:04:54.320> as<00:04:54.380> long<00:04:54.470> as

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
important than damage because as long as

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.230 
important than damage because as long as
you<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.800> stay<00:04:54.950> accurate<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.640> have<00:04:56.210> a

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
you can stay accurate and you have a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.540 
you can stay accurate and you have a
good<00:04:56.390> shop<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.470> should<00:04:57.800> really<00:04:58.010> still<00:04:58.310> do

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
good shop you should really still do

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.160 
good shop you should really still do
rather<00:04:58.760> well<00:04:58.910> with<00:04:59.150> this<00:04:59.240> gun<00:04:59.450> so<00:05:00.050> if<00:05:00.110> you

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
rather well with this gun so if you

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.150 
rather well with this gun so if you
haven't<00:05:00.290> use<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.560> file<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.770> lot<00:05:00.950> of<00:05:01.010> people

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
haven't use the file a lot of people

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.920 
haven't use the file a lot of people
don't<00:05:01.310> like<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.610> use<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.420> picutre<00:05:02.780> like

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
don't like to use it it's a picutre like

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.210 
don't like to use it it's a picutre like
your<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.440> definitely<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.830> last<00:05:03.950> assault

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
your it's definitely the last assault
