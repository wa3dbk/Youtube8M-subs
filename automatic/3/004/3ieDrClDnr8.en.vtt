not many people have but what is
backwards<00:00:10.500> took<00:00:11.340> their<00:00:11.550> original<00:00:11.969> design<00:00:12.120> for

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
backwards took their original design for

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
backwards took their original design for
the<00:00:12.900> party<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> chubby<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.820> just

people at home are just going to love
and<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.710> they<00:00:22.859> did<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.519> took<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.330> design

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and what they did they took that design

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.439 
and what they did they took that design
and<00:00:25.140> stretched<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.699> where<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.180> made

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and stretched it out to where it made

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.410 
and stretched it out to where it made
the<00:00:27.630> racks<00:00:28.160> full-sized<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.699> you've<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.090> now

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the racks full-sized so you've got now

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.410 
the racks full-sized so you've got now
you<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.590> sky's<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> limit<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.000> size<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you the sky's the limit on the size of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.520 
you the sky's the limit on the size of
what<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
what you can put in here you're going to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.170 
what you can put in here you're going to
get<00:00:34.649> whole<00:00:34.920> briskets<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.730> parties<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
get whole briskets in these parties and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
get whole briskets in these parties and
Chubby's<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.469> able<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> put

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
Chubby's you're gonna be able to put

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.729 
Chubby's you're gonna be able to put
whole<00:00:38.129> shoulders<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:40.500> height

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
whole shoulders on them and the height

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
whole shoulders on them and the height
still<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> same<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.420> width

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
still the same it's got the same width

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
still the same it's got the same width
they've<00:00:43.110> stretched<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.399> basically<00:00:44.640> they

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
they've stretched them so basically they

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
they've stretched them so basically they
come<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.410> new<00:00:46.620> finish<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> where

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
come out with a new finish this is where

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
come out with a new finish this is where
the<00:00:47.850> powder<00:00:48.090> coating<00:00:48.570> come<00:00:48.750> from<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the powder coating come from it's now a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
the powder coating come from it's now a
standard<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.879> backwards<00:00:51.510> cookers<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
standard on all backwards cookers it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.000 
standard on all backwards cookers it
works<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.469> well

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
works so well

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
works so well
mark<00:00:53.730> explain<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> g2

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
mark explain a little bit about the g2

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.709 
mark explain a little bit about the g2
well<00:00:55.760> powder<00:00:56.760> coating<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.510> thing

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
well powder coating was the first thing

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.260 
well powder coating was the first thing
the<00:00:58.590> next<00:00:58.829> evolution<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.760> corrosion

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the next evolution was corrosion

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.510 
the next evolution was corrosion
resistance<00:01:00.719> rust<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> downfalls

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
resistance rust was one of the downfalls

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700 
resistance rust was one of the downfalls
of<00:01:03.030> people<00:01:03.300> living<00:01:03.449> him<00:01:03.570> outside<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.379> rusted

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of people living him outside it rusted

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
of people living him outside it rusted
really<00:01:04.920> bad<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.400> they're<00:01:05.519> met<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
really bad because they're met at a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
really bad because they're met at a
carbon<00:01:06.210> steel<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.080> he<00:01:07.350> upgraded<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.950> Galvin<00:01:08.310> L

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
carbon steel so he upgraded to Galvin L

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
carbon steel so he upgraded to Galvin L
which<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> steel<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> galvanized

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which is a steel that has a galvanized

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.940 
which is a steel that has a galvanized
finish<00:01:11.549> annealed<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.080> steel<00:01:13.290> finish<00:01:13.650> it's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
finish annealed to the steel finish it's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
finish annealed to the steel finish it's
much<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.400> corrosion<00:01:14.850> resistant<00:01:15.360> powder

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
much more corrosion resistant powder

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
much more corrosion resistant powder
coating<00:01:16.320> helps<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.100> hide<00:01:17.280> Nicks<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
coating helps a lot to hide Nicks and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.270 
coating helps a lot to hide Nicks and
scratches<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.140> durable<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> heat

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
scratches much more durable and heat

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
scratches much more durable and heat
resistant<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.570> other<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> he

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
resistant the other thing that he

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.880 
resistant the other thing that he
changed<00:01:23.900> which<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> main<00:01:25.470> reason<00:01:25.500> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
changed which was the main reason for

changed which was the main reason for
the<00:01:26.159> g2<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> extra<00:01:27.600> rack<00:01:28.049> depth<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> he

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the g2 was this extra rack depth and he

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.649 
the g2 was this extra rack depth and he
did<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> request<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> some
