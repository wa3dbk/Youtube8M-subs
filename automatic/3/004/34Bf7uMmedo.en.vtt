00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.490
 everyone 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.550
 hello guys and girls from pakapaka today 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 let's make a drum what are we going to do 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.309
 with some cardboard jars we are going to have 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 have to take out the bottom when a bit of 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.829
 force pushing or hitting it with a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.679
 You take him out 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.600
 the lid and I want you then a cylinder 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.420
 the same thing you will do with what was the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.320
 jar lid supports you is the hand and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.320
 makes strength 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.830
 and you donated 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.870
 and you put it exactly where you were in 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.960
 the place where it was opened we already have 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.600
 then the body of our drum 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.600
 to make the patch we are going to use tape 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 it suits you to do it very neatly 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.009
 first with the medium and then cross that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.939
 tape with a cross and then you are taking 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:52.079
 the diagonals 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:53.969
 well up to cover the entire surface if 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.979
 you want to make it prettier you 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.079
 you can add a tape of another color 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.079
 on the edge so you have more trouble 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.569
 and everyone
