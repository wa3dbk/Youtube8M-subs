can imagine to adjust your sound from
the<00:02:45.459> fading<00:02:45.910> balance<00:02:47.640> pretty<00:02:48.640> good<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.180> like

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the fading balance pretty good I like

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.059 
the fading balance pretty good I like
that<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.440> EQ<00:02:51.989> we<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.350> okay<00:02:53.709> i<00:02:53.739> mean

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
that the EQ we know it's okay i mean

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.280 
that the EQ we know it's okay i mean
there's<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> lot<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.489> ways<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.060> customize<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.900> it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there's a lot of ways to customize it it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
there's a lot of ways to customize it it
can<00:02:56.470> sound<00:02:56.650> really<00:02:57.100> sweet<00:02:57.610> when<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.850> play

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
can really tune the base i mean really

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.560 
can really tune the base i mean really
down<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.220> really<00:03:45.459> up<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:45.850> that's<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.239> cool

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
i like the way you could set the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.509 
i like the way you could set the
frequency<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.989> here<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.980> know<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.340> can<00:03:51.489> go

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
frequency on here you know you can go

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.240 
frequency on here you know you can go
all<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.850> way<00:03:51.970> down<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.560> 50<00:03:53.560> hertz<00:03:53.859> which<00:03:53.980> is

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
all the way down to 50 hertz which is

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.840 
all the way down to 50 hertz which is
pretty<00:03:54.579> low<00:03:55.260> um<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.350> said<00:03:56.980> right<00:03:57.130> about<00:03:57.280> 63

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
pretty low um I said right about 63

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.039 
pretty low um I said right about 63
hurts<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.209> thought<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.450> was<00:03:58.540> really<00:03:58.690> good<00:03:58.900> for

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
hurts I thought that was really good for

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.380 
hurts I thought that was really good for
the<00:03:59.140> base<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.190> then<00:04:00.459> i<00:04:00.549> set<00:04:00.790> my<00:04:00.910> high<00:04:01.120> pass

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
the base and then i set my high pass

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.630 
the base and then i set my high pass
filter<00:04:01.930> at<00:04:02.109> 125<00:04:02.799> hertz<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.370> makes<00:04:03.519> this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
filter at 125 hertz that makes this

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.120 
filter at 125 hertz that makes this
sound<00:04:03.819> really<00:04:04.209> good<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:07.799> could<00:04:08.799> turn<00:04:08.950> up

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
sound really good and you could turn up

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.640 
sound really good and you could turn up
the<00:04:09.310> level<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.910> amp<00:04:10.120> level<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.660> stuff<00:04:10.840> what's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
the level the amp level and stuff what's

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.420 
the level the amp level and stuff what's
all<00:04:11.769> like<00:04:11.950> bass<00:04:12.430> boost<00:04:12.790> mmm<00:04:13.980> misty<00:04:14.980> knows<00:04:15.160> not

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
all like bass boost mmm misty knows not

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.430 
all like bass boost mmm misty knows not
only<00:04:15.459> know<00:04:16.000> about<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.570> it's<00:04:16.840> not<00:04:17.320> the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440
