bit of cracking because I just kind of
adds<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.250> effect<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.390> bead<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.610> you

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
adds to the effect of the bead and you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.460 
adds to the effect of the bead and you
can<00:02:13.910> shape<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.570> any<00:02:14.810> way<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.320> want

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
can shape this in any way that you want

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.680 
can shape this in any way that you want
you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.980> roll<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> into<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.519> ball<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.120> or

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you can roll it into a ball like this or

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.710 
you can roll it into a ball like this or
we're<00:02:18.050> actually<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.800> roll<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:20.300> one

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we're actually going to roll it on one

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.810 
we're actually going to roll it on one
side<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.380> I'm<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.800> make<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.040> into<00:02:22.519> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
side here I'm going to make it into the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
side here I'm going to make it into the
teardrop<00:02:26.380> there<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:27.500> go

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
teardrop there we go

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.009 
teardrop there we go
my<00:02:29.580> hands<00:02:29.819> are<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.120> slick<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> doesn't<00:02:30.810> want<00:02:30.930> to

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
my hands are so slick it doesn't want to

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:42.170 
my hands are so slick it doesn't want to
roll<00:02:31.170> keep<00:02:32.159> slipping<00:02:32.670> there<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.330> go

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 

it's<00:02:42.689> okay<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.109> little<00:02:43.409> bit<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.590> black<00:02:43.799> shows

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
