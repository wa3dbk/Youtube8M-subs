00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that's going to pop them up for a juggle

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.549 
that's going to pop them up for a juggle
and<00:00:51.330> from<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.900> we're<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.379> into

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and from there we're going to go into

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
and from there we're going to go into
her<00:00:52.830> destiny<00:00:53.460> calling<00:00:53.760> string<00:00:54.330> which<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> two

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
her destiny calling string which is two

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
her destiny calling string which is two
three<00:00:57.140> right<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.650> those<00:00:58.890> three<00:00:59.220> together

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
three right now so those three together

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.090 
three right now so those three together
will<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.970> this

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.410 

alright<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:06.060> you're<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
alright now from there you're going to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.930 
alright now from there you're going to
go<00:01:06.570> into<00:01:06.720> our<00:01:06.990> Amazons<00:01:07.620> blast<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> back

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
go into our Amazons blast which is back

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.180 
go into our Amazons blast which is back
three<00:01:11.300> alright<00:01:12.300> so<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.170> timing<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
three alright so the timing on that is

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.070 
three alright so the timing on that is
pretty<00:01:14.490> tricky<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> basically

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
pretty tricky you're going to basically

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
pretty tricky you're going to basically
have<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.620> wait<00:01:16.800> for<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> recovery<00:01:17.909> frames<00:01:18.300> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
have to wait for the recovery frames to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
have to wait for the recovery frames to
end<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> destiny<00:01:19.740> calling<00:01:20.010> string<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
end on the destiny calling string and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.270 
end on the destiny calling string and
then<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.690> when<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:22.050> end<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.680> press<00:01:22.979> back

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then right when they end you press back

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
then right when they end you press back
three<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.940> wouldn't<00:01:24.570> recommend<00:01:24.840> trying<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
three I wouldn't recommend trying to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.030 
three I wouldn't recommend trying to
mash<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.930> press<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.829> for

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
mash it because if you press back or for

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
mash it because if you press back or for
three<00:01:29.430> right<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> recovery<00:01:30.659> frame<00:01:31.079> frames

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
three right as a recovery frame frames

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
three right as a recovery frame frames
end<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.579> gives<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.149> little<00:01:33.240> speed

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
end it gives you like a little speed

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.859 
end it gives you like a little speed
boost<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.369> case<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.390> won't<00:01:36.539> hit<00:01:36.810> them

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
boost and in this case it won't hit them

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
boost and in this case it won't hit them
unless<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> speed<00:01:38.009> boost<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
unless you get that speed boost so

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
unless you get that speed boost so
here's<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.630> difference<00:01:40.049> between<00:01:40.259> trying<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
here's a difference between trying to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.140 
here's a difference between trying to
mash<00:01:41.219> it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.180 

then<00:01:45.150> hit<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.660> here's<00:01:45.990> hitting<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.800> right<00:01:47.010> on

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
then hit now here's hitting it right on

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.000 
then hit now here's hitting it right on
time<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.890> difference

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
time so there's a little difference

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.880 
time so there's a little difference
right<00:01:53.760> there<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.240> basically<00:01:55.170> after<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.740> hit

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
right there so basically after just hit

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.610 
right there so basically after just hit
it<00:01:56.010> once<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.550> then<00:01:56.700> hit<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.120> time<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:58.200> from

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
it once and then hit it on time now from

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.320 
it once and then hit it on time now from
the<00:01:58.740> Amazons<00:01:59.250> blast<00:01:59.610> you're<00:01:59.850> going<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.030> jump

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
the Amazons blast you're going to jump

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.240 
the Amazons blast you're going to jump
and<00:02:00.510> hit<00:02:00.690> him<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.050> lasso<00:02:01.500> slam<00:02:01.800> which<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and hit him with the lasso slam which is

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.170 
and hit him with the lasso slam which is
3:00<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.760> air<00:02:04.670> you're<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
3:00 in the air you're going to want to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
3:00 in the air you're going to want to
wait<00:02:06.450> till<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.870> last<00:02:07.050> second<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:07.860> before

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
wait till the last second right before

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.260 
wait till the last second right before
they<00:02:08.310> hit<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.490> ground<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.060> hit<00:02:09.149> him<00:02:09.240> with

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
they hit the ground and hit him with

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.770 
they hit the ground and hit him with
this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
this
that<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.140> you'll<00:02:10.649> hit<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.070> ground<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.730> time

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that way you'll hit the ground in time

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.840 
that way you'll hit the ground in time
to<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.330> into<00:02:12.590> another<00:02:13.590> destiny<00:02:14.550> calling

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
to go into another destiny calling

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.480 
to go into another destiny calling
string<00:02:18.830> all<00:02:19.830> right<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.130> you're<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
string all right now you're going to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.729 
string all right now you're going to
finish<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.940> combo<00:02:21.480> off<00:02:21.660> after<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.320> second

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
finish this combo off after the second
