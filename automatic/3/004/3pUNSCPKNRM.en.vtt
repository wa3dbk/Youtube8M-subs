had dogs and so you can see the effect

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.109 
had dogs and so you can see the effect
of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> dogs<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.560> clearly<00:00:17.100> has<00:00:17.250> created

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119

all<00:00:18.390> kinds<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.750> ground<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.170> soiling<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
all kinds of ground in soiling and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.740 
all kinds of ground in soiling and
there's<00:00:19.980> some<00:00:20.100> scratches<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.939> related

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
there's some scratches and related

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.529 
there's some scratches and related
damage<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> leather<00:00:22.760> but<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
damage to the leather but here was the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.990 
damage to the leather but here was the
original<00:00:25.109> color<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:26.760> going

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
original color and so what we're going

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.019 
original color and so what we're going
to<00:00:27.119> end<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.420> doing<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:29.029> coloring

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to end up doing is actually coloring

this<00:00:30.210> leather<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.720> bring<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.050> back<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> where

it<00:00:31.500> needs<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> also<00:00:32.910> thought<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it needs to be but I also thought this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
it needs to be but I also thought this
would<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:33.930> opportunity<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.649> show<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
let's take a look at the effects one of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.090 
let's take a look at the effects one of
the<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.350> one<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> sort<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the one of the one of the sort of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
the one of the one of the sort of
important<00:00:53.610> steps<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> process<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> use

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
important steps in the process is to use

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.799 
important steps in the process is to use
the<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.500> tool<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.860> application<00:00:56.610> purposes

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
the right tool for application purposes

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.520 
the right tool for application purposes
we<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> cleaning<00:00:58.350> love<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.219> is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
we have a cleaning love that is

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
we have a cleaning love that is
basically<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.770> construct<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.579> sort<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
basically the construct of a sort of a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
basically the construct of a sort of a
scratchy<00:01:03.420> material<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.830> rough

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
scratchy material it's a little rough

not<00:01:06.030> quite<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.450> soft<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.950> terry<00:01:08.369> cloth

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
not quite as soft as a as a terry cloth

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
not quite as soft as a as a terry cloth
towel<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.479> bit<00:01:09.600> rougher<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.049> not

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
towel but a little bit rougher but not

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
towel but a little bit rougher but not
so<00:01:10.439> rough<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> scratch<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
quantity want to sort of smoosh it
around<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> begin<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
around and then I'm going to begin a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.390 
around and then I'm going to begin a
sort<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> scrubbing<00:01:47.640> action

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
sort of a scrubbing action

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.670 
sort of a scrubbing action
then<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.030> objective<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.230> get<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
then the objective is to get the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.460 
then the objective is to get the
chemistry<00:01:51.220> down<00:01:51.580> into<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.240> into<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.260> grain

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
chemistry down into the into the grain

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.950 
chemistry down into the into the grain
pattern<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.130> leather<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.720> allow<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
pattern of the leather and allow it to

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.470 
pattern of the leather and allow it to
do<00:01:56.230> its<00:01:56.440> thing<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.830> actually<00:01:57.280> releasing<00:01:57.820> now

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
do its thing of actually releasing now

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.970 
do its thing of actually releasing now
you<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.720> see<00:01:58.930> immediately<00:01:59.050> if<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.680> look<00:01:59.860> at

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
you can see immediately if you look at

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.470 
you can see immediately if you look at
the<00:02:00.100> end<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.370> my<00:02:00.490> finger<00:02:00.550> that<00:02:01.120> we've<00:02:01.240> got<00:02:01.450> a

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
the end of my finger that we've got a

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.420 
the end of my finger that we've got a
fair<00:02:01.780> degree<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.050> soil<00:02:02.380> already<00:02:02.890> coming<00:02:03.160> up

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
fair degree of soil already coming up

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.060 
fair degree of soil already coming up
but<00:02:04.300> what<00:02:04.960> we<00:02:05.080> want<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.380> do<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.710> we<00:02:05.830> want<00:02:06.010> to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
but what we want to do is we want to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.639 
but what we want to do is we want to
apply<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.520> generous<00:02:06.760> amount<00:02:07.510> of<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.229> cleaner

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
apply a generous amount of this cleaner

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.060 
apply a generous amount of this cleaner
the<00:02:09.460> more<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:09.910> apply<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:11.140> more<00:02:11.440> chemical

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
the more we apply the more chemical

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.740 
the more we apply the more chemical
action<00:02:12.310> we're<00:02:12.760> going<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.540> actually

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
action we're going to have and actually

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.500 
action we're going to have and actually
cleaning<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.650> leather<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.700> while<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
cleaning the leather so while the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.930 
cleaning the leather so while the
leather<00:02:16.720> may<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.080> been<00:02:17.260> filthy<00:02:17.740> dirty<00:02:17.980> this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
leather may have been filthy dirty this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.050 
leather may have been filthy dirty this
cleaner<00:02:19.360> really<00:02:19.840> works<00:02:20.080> well<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:21.580> releasing

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
cleaner really works well in releasing

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.449 
cleaner really works well in releasing
the<00:02:22.360> soil<00:02:22.600> particles<00:02:23.200> from<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> leather<00:02:23.800> and

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
the soil particles from the leather and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.270 
the soil particles from the leather and
and<00:02:25.270> lifting<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.080> up<00:02:26.170> off<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.590> surface<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and lifting it up off the surface of the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.000 
and lifting it up off the surface of the
leather<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.050> cleaner<00:02:29.350> doesn't<00:02:29.680> just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
leather so so the cleaner doesn't just

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.070 
leather so so the cleaner doesn't just
dissolve<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> dirt<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.030> actually<00:02:31.240> helps<00:02:31.930> to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
dissolve the dirt it actually helps to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.810 
dissolve the dirt it actually helps to
remove<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.680> from<00:02:32.800> down<00:02:33.040> deep<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.610> grain

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
remove it from down deep in the grain

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.340 
remove it from down deep in the grain
pattern<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.360> lift<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.720> up<00:02:34.810> off<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
pattern and lift it up off of the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
pattern and lift it up off of the
leather<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:36.430> now<00:02:36.550> let's<00:02:36.760> take<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.970> look<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.360> what

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
leather so now let's take a look at what

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.940 
leather so now let's take a look at what
this<00:02:37.660> looks<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:38.500> I'm<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.800> do

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
this looks like so what I'm going to do

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.230 
this looks like so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.250> going<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.459> take<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:39.820> soapy<00:02:40.209> residue

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
is I'm going to take this soapy residue

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.990 
is I'm going to take this soapy residue
I<00:02:40.959> frankly<00:02:41.770> like<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.130> leave<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> sit<00:02:42.640> for<00:02:42.670> about

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
I frankly like to leave it sit for about

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.210 
I frankly like to leave it sit for about
a<00:02:43.300> minute<00:02:43.690> because<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.230> helps<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.680> chemistry

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
a minute because it helps the chemistry

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.070 
a minute because it helps the chemistry
to<00:02:45.310> actually<00:02:45.700> help<00:02:45.850> him<00:02:46.090> drawing<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> dirt

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
to actually help him drawing the dirt

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.949 
to actually help him drawing the dirt
particles<00:02:47.860> off<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.520> leather<00:02:48.700> but<00:02:49.480> I'm

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
particles off of the leather but I'm

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.020 
particles off of the leather but I'm
going<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.380> pull<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.590> off<00:02:50.830> now<00:02:51.070> after<00:02:51.370> about<00:02:51.640> 20

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
going to pull it off now after about 20

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.570 
going to pull it off now after about 20
seconds<00:02:52.420> or<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.680> let's<00:02:53.890> take<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> look

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.270 

so<00:02:57.580> here<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> are<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:58.989> see<00:02:59.260> from<00:02:59.739> this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
so here you are you can see from this

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.130 
so here you are you can see from this
side<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:00.940> compared<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.630> here<00:03:01.930> where<00:03:02.050> we

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
side here compared to this here where we

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.990 
side here compared to this here where we
haven't<00:03:02.470> done<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.130> differential<00:03:03.850> now

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
haven't done the differential now

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.610 
haven't done the differential now
clearly<00:03:04.330> this<00:03:04.480> leather<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.930> badly<00:03:05.170> scratched

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
clearly this leather is badly scratched

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.170 
clearly this leather is badly scratched
but<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.130> will<00:03:06.250> be<00:03:06.370> dealt<00:03:06.610> with<00:03:06.700> when<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:06.970> do

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
but that will be dealt with when we do

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.509 
but that will be dealt with when we do
the<00:03:07.330> finishing<00:03:07.780> process<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.310> see

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
the finishing process but you can see

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.130 
the finishing process but you can see
the<00:03:09.670> effect<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.269> cleaner<00:03:10.540> between<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
the effect of the cleaner between the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.380 
the effect of the cleaner between the
component<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.890> didn't<00:03:12.130> clean<00:03:12.340> here<00:03:12.700> here

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
component that we didn't clean here here

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.250 
component that we didn't clean here here
rather<00:03:13.600> than<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
rather than the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.250 
rather than the
in<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:14.980> often<00:03:15.670> times<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.629> have<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> deeply

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
in here often times if I have a deeply

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.259 
in here often times if I have a deeply
soiled<00:03:17.620> piece<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.159> do<00:03:18.220> here<00:03:18.610> I'll<00:03:18.970> do<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
soiled piece like I do here I'll do it

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.839 
soiled piece like I do here I'll do it
again<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.840> by<00:03:20.349> doing<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.890> again<00:03:21.159> just<00:03:21.459> simply

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
again and by doing it again just simply

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.059 
again and by doing it again just simply
helps<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.360> release<00:03:23.140> some<00:03:23.439> of<00:03:23.470> those<00:03:23.709> really

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
helps to release some of those really

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.839 
helps to release some of those really
deeply<00:03:24.760> ground<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.299> soil<00:03:26.049> particles<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.670> I

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
deeply ground in soil particles and I
