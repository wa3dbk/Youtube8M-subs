in<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.929> think<00:00:30.990> those<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.349> my<00:00:31.380> bees<00:00:31.679> with

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
in here I think those are my bees with

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.360 
in here I think those are my bees with
potatoes<00:00:32.309> growing<00:00:32.610> back<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> it's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
potatoes growing back there but so it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.819 
potatoes growing back there but so it's
a<00:00:35.430> little<00:00:35.520> bit<00:00:35.700> gnarly<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.600> he's<00:00:37.440> hoping<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a little bit gnarly but he's hoping that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.090 
a little bit gnarly but he's hoping that
we<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> grow<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.510> winter<00:00:39.510> greens<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.469> some

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.700 
we can grow some winter greens and some
