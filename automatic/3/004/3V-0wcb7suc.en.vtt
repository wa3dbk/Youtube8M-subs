00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
of just using the 15 progression i'm

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.009 
of just using the 15 progression i'm
going<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> use<00:00:22.730> 251<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
going to use 251 it's going to get a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.570 
going to use 251 it's going to get a
little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.500> complicated<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.400> those
