to<00:01:05.640> helicopters<00:01:06.270> they<00:01:06.420> cost<00:01:06.659> ten<00:01:06.990> times<00:01:07.020> as

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to helicopters they cost ten times as

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.820 
to helicopters they cost ten times as
much<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:09.030> fly<00:01:09.330> low<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.659> slow<00:01:10.110> which

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
much and it can fly low and slow which

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
much and it can fly low and slow which
is<00:01:10.979> ideal<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.460> aerial<00:01:12.150> surveillance<00:01:12.260> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is ideal for aerial surveillance so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
is ideal for aerial surveillance so
therefore<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:14.040> extremely<00:01:15.030> slow<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
therefore we can go extremely slow and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
therefore we can go extremely slow and
observe<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> area<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.439> low<00:01:16.680> altitudes<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.460> can

observe the area at low altitudes we can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
observe the area at low altitudes we can
operate<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.470> 500<00:01:19.470> feet<00:01:19.619> off<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> ground<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.310> we
