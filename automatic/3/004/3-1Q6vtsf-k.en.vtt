 technology with social responsibility and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.630
 we have constituted ourselves in the university 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.850
 with the greatest potential for 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.150
 project development our work 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.920

 call made by the senacyt in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.980
 the year 2008 we were the university that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.650
 got the highest allocation around 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 10 million 500 thousand dollars with seven 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.730

 executed in recent years 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.270
 the national polytechnic school has 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.760
 with units dedicated to 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.670
 research as the departments of 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.440

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 school as in the first of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.940
 university and the use of

 foundation 143 years ago has contributed 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.489
 decidedly to scientific development and 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.560
 Ecuador's technological challenges 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.349
 for the next few years are great in the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.970
 research our institution is
