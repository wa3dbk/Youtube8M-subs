00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:13.949
 by rb t4 which is used to measure 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 with the amount of col in the blood 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.800
 in blood 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 these are you can do two tests 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.759
 one indirect and one direct the indirect 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.669
 with the teacher the direct one can be with

 means of legal medicine or volume same 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.320
 of blood 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.390
 stella with sensor here our result 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 this the printer where he prints the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.960
 result 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.910
 and shows you the amount here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.380
 will show amounts of alcohol 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.380
 that the person has in blood 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.230
 then the console monthly 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.080
 Breathalyzer because there is the person is the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.720
 the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.270
 they say that drunkenness 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.270
 then only drunkenness 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.840
 d 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.470
 not just one doctor for another 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.690
 substance not only because of perseverance 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.670
 who soon give me Alcohol 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 amount of any that has the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 personality consumed the person has 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.990
 in blood 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 let's use this mouthpiece 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.350
 with disposable mouthpiece then it 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 used as a person to be 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.490
 used the procedure was finished 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.760
 according to a suitable bag a bag 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.760
 red 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.319
 and when it's going to be the procedure 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.229
 of the person that's why we use a 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.229
 single person think that one or several 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.960
 when the person comes out positive when 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.370
 is there a first positive test 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.400
 have to do a second test 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.570
 because sometimes also in the person 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.729
 You can also have alcohol but alcohol 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.170
 in the mouth how do I explain the tail in the mouth 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.540
 soon he had a dinner and he is 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.930
 twice tourist you have there listerine 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 that contain alcohol and suddenly it 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.060
 separated a Breathalyzer operative and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.989
 he did the test and it comes out positive 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:35.460
 when it's done from 3 to 15 minutes to 15 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.350
 minutes should no longer have 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.780
 alcohol if you have alcohol in your mouth if 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.640
 has alcohol in blood 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.400
 the test becomes effective and the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.310
 result towards positive 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:54.310
 It is done when it is done when it is used 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 on both sides 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.800
 previously legal medicine said that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.780
 was 40 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.220
 of 40 up to be 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.310
 vehicle immunization procedure 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.430
 with the new law the 15 48 merlano law 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.260
 it was set from 20 upwards sometimes 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:18.220
 do not have 20 of indented 0.20 it becomes a 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.320
 second test and he got a 0.21 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.000
 the mediation procedure is done 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.800
 of the vehicle is the advisor of 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800
 and license suspension 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 that has to be taken five or six 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.340
 times with a German brand of the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.340
 points 0.6 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.210
 but then 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.260
 it's a garden 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.370
 in terms of driving if you are going to 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.019
 driving the idea is that it does not consume anything 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.470
 because the idea is that nothing comes out 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:03.800
 in the test that will be him 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.800
 any degree of alcohol grade 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.370
 is sanctioning 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.420
 in terms of 519 down 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.130
 You can be sanctioned with an order 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.130
 Apparent but not munipe 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.129
 a kolem jaa test 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:35.129
 you have ingested negative liquor 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.770
 no no 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.209
 the procedure a nozzle completely 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.209
 sealed 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.330
 10 47 40 9 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.169
 528 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.080
 and we started doing we started from scratch 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.060
 let's use 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.060
 continuous 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.780
 there is the source of valuation 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.669
 unification of sleep 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.570
 the entity of the operator 2,000 people 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.570
 26 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:26.300
 the temperature is 25 hours 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.620
 the result here started when 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.080
 we started that we started to be a 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.400
 machine is at zero and the result of 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.840
 Sir 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.840
 at 15 and 20 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.980
 and here we are given the name of the Lord the 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.449
 operator name a witness if there is 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.560
 the place where the test was done 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:51.440
 be firm 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.990
 my name wilber at least my code 126 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.520
 I'm in charge of the sensor with either 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.740
 the test 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.810
 in the administrative department of 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.569
 transport transit of Cartagena there 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.100
 a myth out there says it 's equal to 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.120
 gasolines we're going to cancer 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.750
 do not use that we damage the equipment 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:15.230
 It is better not to take if you are going to take between
