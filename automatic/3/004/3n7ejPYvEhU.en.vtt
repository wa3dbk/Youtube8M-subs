did<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> job<00:02:01.520> well<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:01.910> mean<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.180> didn't

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
did the job well I mean I didn't

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.030 
did the job well I mean I didn't
I<00:02:02.660> don't<00:02:02.960> regret<00:02:03.080> buying<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.710> was<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> good

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
I don't regret buying it it was a good

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.430 
I don't regret buying it it was a good
time<00:02:04.310> well<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:04.790> had<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.360> yeah<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.140> served<00:02:06.350> me

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
time well I had it and yeah it served me

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.479 
time well I had it and yeah it served me
well<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.700> anyways<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.810> guess<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.100> specs<00:02:10.340> on

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
well so anyways I guess for the specs on

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.910 
well so anyways I guess for the specs on
the<00:02:10.550> bike<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:11.390> got<00:02:11.510> around<00:02:12.140> 16<00:02:12.590> horsepower

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
the bike it's got around 16 horsepower

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.780 
the bike it's got around 16 horsepower
so<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.550> pretty<00:02:13.850> weak<00:02:14.860> its<00:02:15.860> air-cooled<00:02:16.459> not

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so it's pretty weak its air-cooled not

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.960 
so it's pretty weak its air-cooled not
liquid<00:02:17.180> cooled<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.650> five-speed<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.610> I

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
liquid cooled it's a five-speed so I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.370 
liquid cooled it's a five-speed so I
don't<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> constantly<00:02:20.959> found<00:02:21.140> myself

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
don't know I constantly found myself

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.170 
don't know I constantly found myself
trying<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.800> shift<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> six<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.030> was

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
trying to shift up to six then it was

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.770 
trying to shift up to six then it was
never<00:02:23.330> there

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
never there

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.010 
never there
but<00:02:24.500> yeah<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.510> might<00:02:26.690> find<00:02:26.720> yourself

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
but yeah so you might find yourself

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.750 
but yeah so you might find yourself
searching<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.920> other<00:02:28.070> gear<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.550> not

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
searching for that other gear that's not

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.720 
searching for that other gear that's not
there<00:02:29.050> seat<00:02:30.050> height<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.260> actually<00:02:30.730> incredibly

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there seat height is actually incredibly

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
there seat height is actually incredibly
low<00:02:31.850> twenty<00:02:32.270> six<00:02:32.450> point<00:02:32.660> six<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
low twenty six point six so this is a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.440 
low twenty six point six so this is a
really<00:02:33.709> good<00:02:33.860> bike<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.340> shorter<00:02:34.880> people<00:02:35.030> you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really good bike for shorter people you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
really good bike for shorter people you
know<00:02:35.570> I'd<00:02:36.350> say<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.800> you're<00:02:36.980> under<00:02:37.250> five<00:02:37.459> six<00:02:37.730> or

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
know I'd say if you're under five six or

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.350 
know I'd say if you're under five six or
something<00:02:38.270> or<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:39.170> female<00:02:39.820> if<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.940> could<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.209> good

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
something or a female if I could be good

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.560 
something or a female if I could be good
for<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.110> pretty<00:02:42.410> light<00:02:42.980> bike<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.459> think

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
for you it's a pretty light bike I think

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.240 
for you it's a pretty light bike I think
it's<00:02:44.570> wet<00:02:44.870> weight<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.200> around<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.530> 320<00:02:46.130> or

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
it's wet weight is around like 320 or

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.039 
it's wet weight is around like 320 or
something<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.150> one<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.900> lighter

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
something so it's one of the lighter

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.390 
something so it's one of the lighter
bikes<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.560> its<00:02:48.680> class<00:02:49.989> it's<00:02:50.989> got<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.650> disc<00:02:52.160> brake

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
bikes in its class it's got a disc brake

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.840 
bikes in its class it's got a disc brake
in<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.549> front<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.150> drum<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.570> back<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
in the front and a drum in the back so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.600 
in the front and a drum in the back so
take<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.030> out<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.209> will<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:58.220> far<00:02:58.430> as<00:02:58.519> the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
take that out you will as far as the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.400 
take that out you will as far as the
handling<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.060> concerned<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.780> bike<00:02:59.959> handle<00:03:00.320> is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
handling is concerned the bike handle is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.920 
handling is concerned the bike handle is
alright<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.640> mean<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.180> slide<00:03:02.540> enough<00:03:02.810> to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
alright I mean it's slide enough to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.360 
alright I mean it's slide enough to
where<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.440> feel<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.799> you're<00:03:04.220> in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
where you know you feel like you're in

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.860 
where you know you feel like you're in
control<00:03:04.489> pretty<00:03:04.970> much<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.239> all<00:03:05.299> times<00:03:05.510> really

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
control pretty much at all times really

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.100 
control pretty much at all times really
easy<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.170> move<00:03:06.260> around<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.680> stuff<00:03:06.950> but<00:03:07.220> uh<00:03:07.280> I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
easy to move around and stuff but uh I

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.509 
easy to move around and stuff but uh I
haven't<00:03:09.110> ridden<00:03:09.350> any<00:03:09.530> larger<00:03:09.980> cruiser<00:03:10.220> bikes

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
haven't ridden any larger cruiser bikes

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.080 
haven't ridden any larger cruiser bikes
so<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.820> can't<00:03:11.120> really<00:03:11.329> compare<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> well

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so I can't really compare it to well

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.650 
so I can't really compare it to well
to<00:03:13.209> anything<00:03:13.599> bigger<00:03:13.900> than<00:03:14.020> this<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:15.660> yeah

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
to anything bigger than this but yeah

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.920 
to anything bigger than this but yeah
you<00:03:17.260> know<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.500> doesn't<00:03:17.709> offer<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.160> same<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
you're a beginner you know this might be

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.320 
you're a beginner you know this might be
right<00:03:32.080> up<00:03:32.140> your<00:03:32.230> alley<00:03:32.349> so<00:03:32.860> who<00:03:33.519> knows<00:03:36.330> overall

I<00:03:37.360> mean<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.900> windscreen<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.800> having<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
I mean the windscreen it not having a

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.320 
I mean the windscreen it not having a
windscreen<00:03:39.489> which<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.790> mean<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.030> course<00:03:40.150> he

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
windscreen which I mean of course he

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.240 
windscreen which I mean of course he
could<00:03:40.450> add<00:03:40.569> on<00:03:40.690> later<00:03:40.870> but<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.530> didn't<00:03:42.130> bother

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
could add on later but I didn't bother

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.490 
could add on later but I didn't bother
me<00:03:42.489> at<00:03:42.610> all<00:03:42.700> since<00:03:43.420> you're<00:03:43.660> really<00:03:44.290> never

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
me at all since you're really never

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.140 
me at all since you're really never
going<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.980> fast<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.459> guess<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.790> didn't<00:03:46.030> matter

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
going that fast I guess it didn't matter

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.229 
going that fast I guess it didn't matter
but<00:03:46.750> yeah<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.709> don't<00:03:48.549> know<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.730> guess<00:03:48.970> basically

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
but yeah I don't know I guess basically

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.199 
but yeah I don't know I guess basically
I<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.750> say<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.819> if<00:03:51.819> you're<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.120> looking

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
I would say that if you're just looking

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.729 
I would say that if you're just looking
for<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.510> good<00:03:52.630> time<00:03:52.840> something<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.530> cruise

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
for a good time something to cruise

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.800 
for a good time something to cruise
around<00:03:53.890> on<00:03:54.160> gets<00:03:54.549> good<00:03:54.730> gas<00:03:55.060> mileage<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.569> mean<00:03:55.720> I

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
around on gets good gas mileage I mean I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.680 
around on gets good gas mileage I mean I
think<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.140> averaged<00:03:56.560> around<00:03:56.709> like<00:03:56.950> 60<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.580> 65<00:03:58.269> on

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
think I averaged around like 60 to 65 on

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.289 
think I averaged around like 60 to 65 on
it<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.530> would<00:03:59.590> commute

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
it and I would commute

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.589 
it and I would commute
probably<00:04:02.170> half<00:04:02.319> freeway<00:04:02.799> half<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:04.330> city

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
probably half freeway half just city

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.070 
probably half freeway half just city
conditions<00:04:05.849> going<00:04:06.849> around<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.450> don't<00:04:07.510> know<00:04:07.630> 15

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
conditions going around I don't know 15

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.300 
conditions going around I don't know 15
miles<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:09.459> work<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.540> 50<00:04:11.080> miles<00:04:11.290> back<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.890> round

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
miles to work in 50 miles back so round

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.690 
miles to work in 50 miles back so round
38<00:04:12.730> miles<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.120> day<00:04:13.150> maybe<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.720> commute<00:04:14.019> and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
38 miles a day maybe in a commute and

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.270 
38 miles a day maybe in a commute and
hey<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.760> know<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.030> lost<00:04:16.180> me<00:04:16.329> well<00:04:16.630> so

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.340 

I<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.850> tank<00:04:20.030> size<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.510> around<00:04:20.630> 2.6

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
I think the tank size is around 2.6

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.120 
I think the tank size is around 2.6
gallons<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.940> know<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.120> got<00:04:23.830> go<00:04:24.830> while

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
gallons so you know you got go while

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.750 
gallons so you know you got go while
without<00:04:25.340> having<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.760> fill<00:04:25.910> up<00:04:27.280> no<00:04:28.280> fuel<00:04:28.520> gauge

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
without having to fill up no fuel gauge

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.900 
without having to fill up no fuel gauge
but<00:04:29.710> doesn't<00:04:30.710> really<00:04:30.830> matter<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.310> mean<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.730> just

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
but doesn't really matter I mean it just

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.670 
but doesn't really matter I mean it just
you<00:04:32.330> flip<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.810> reserve<00:04:33.110> any<00:04:33.290> time<00:04:33.350> it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
you flip to the reserve any time it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.950 
you flip to the reserve any time it
putters<00:04:34.040> out<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.580> not<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.760> big<00:04:35.030> deal<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.480> think

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
putters out it's not a big deal I think

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.379 
putters out it's not a big deal I think
that<00:04:36.139> happens<00:04:36.530> around<00:04:36.650> 2.2<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.760> want<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.240> say

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
that happens around 2.2 I want to say

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.690 
that happens around 2.2 I want to say
maybe<00:04:38.600> two<00:04:41.740> yeah<00:04:42.740> that's<00:04:43.100> really<00:04:43.310> all<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.610> have

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
maybe two yeah that's really all I have

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.340 
maybe two yeah that's really all I have
to<00:04:43.760> say<00:04:43.790> about<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.150> bike<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.540> mean<00:04:44.570> again<00:04:45.080> if

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
to say about the bike I mean again if

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.780 
to say about the bike I mean again if
you<00:04:45.680> are<00:04:46.100> looking<00:04:46.970> for<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.660> small<00:04:47.840> cruiser<00:04:48.290> bike

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
you are looking for a small cruiser bike

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.950 
you are looking for a small cruiser bike
this<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:50.000> perfect<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.540> mean<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:50.900> very

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
this is perfect I mean it's very

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.830 
this is perfect I mean it's very
reliable<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.830> got<00:04:52.160> mine<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.940> was<00:04:53.090> an<00:04:53.180> 87<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.750> it

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
reliable I got mine it was an 87 and it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.490 
reliable I got mine it was an 87 and it
ran<00:04:54.050> flawlessly<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.990> yeah<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.050> can't<00:04:57.350> say

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
ran flawlessly so yeah I can't say

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.870 
ran flawlessly so yeah I can't say
enough<00:04:57.650> good<00:04:57.800> about<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.160> bike<00:04:58.340> for<00:04:58.669> what<00:04:58.790> it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
enough good about the bike for what it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.350 
enough good about the bike for what it
was<00:04:59.090> but<00:04:59.620> again<00:05:00.620> if<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:00.919> find<00:05:01.370> yourself<00:05:01.520> if

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
was but again if you find yourself if

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.340 
was but again if you find yourself if
you<00:05:02.479> think<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.960> were<00:05:03.020> going<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.200> want

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
you think that you were going to want

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.850 
you think that you were going to want
something<00:05:03.500> more<00:05:04.660> then<00:05:05.660> get<00:05:06.139> something<00:05:06.470> more<00:05:06.650> I

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
something more then get something more I

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.469 
something more then get something more I
mean<00:05:07.130> this<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.550> bike<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.060> you'll<00:05:08.360> probably

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
mean this is a bike that you'll probably

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.790 
mean this is a bike that you'll probably
outgrow<00:05:08.960> in<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.169> month<00:05:09.350> or<00:05:09.440> two<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:10.510> yeah<00:05:11.800> take

outgrow in a month or two so yeah take
it<00:05:12.919> for<00:05:13.070> what<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.250> worth
