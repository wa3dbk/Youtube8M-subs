00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 we go now immediately to quito where the legislative commission on 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.700
 Food sovereignty presented its final report of the draft law of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.980
 waters the next step will be the vote of the plenary of the assembly 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.049
 national and there are very interesting points to talk about this bill 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.520
 especially the fight of the slogan that they have in mind that says not a step 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 back and that allowed to keep in this report issues like 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.669
 considered as fundamental for the people of Ecuador have to do with the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.980
 protection and preservation of the ecological system where also 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.280
 prohibits of course the water service for all the inhabitants and about 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 everything the Indians 1 are saying to the privatization we have 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.390
 online to Pedro de la Cruz Assembly member of the commission that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.460
 is working on the topic let's talk about this question pointed 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 leprosos welcome I want to ask you how an exit to this crisis was achieved 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 that is done from the assembly to get the necessary votes and sadar 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 if it is rejected or if it is said that this bill 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.010
 good night Latin American people percent 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 I believe that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 this law is one of the most important series 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.940
 especially for all Ecuadorians 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.260
 because it's the law that 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.270
 the second golden the issue of labor tenure 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.430
 and also in fact the priest cooperativists 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.800
 the new political constitution of the state here you see if you are radicalizing 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.690
 the citizen revolution 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 commands we maintain in the statute that's why 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.300
 the interest maybe the indigenous sectors to have more relationship and 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.190
 eight conception of this vital resource that is of this this has 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.000
 Water 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 not even to pay held rule have said that it is not a resource but that 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.920
 a vital element 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.330
 in the other it gives iceberg the life and also the water and the earth that gives us 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.030
 to eat 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.479
 then in that framework 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.390
 the comrades have manifested themselves of the concern of basketball or in some 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.869
 aspects for which it has been called critical knots that is a mind up to the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.600
 moment 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 the chairman of the commission than the rapporteur who according to the law he should 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.340
 collect 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.010
 all opinions 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.410
 hop part of the opinions was that it has been done in second and final 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 debate but to spend that is reviewed and open kissed why 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 this represents at three in the afternoon 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.119
 I think nothing caught the most points 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.769
 complex cd that has been raised from different sectors of the country 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:37.089
 that face the great fundamental issue and is the human right to water the 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.219
 Argentine experience in privatizations I think it speaks clearly what is not 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.290
 should do in a process like this 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 that is why I ask you how the human right to water is guaranteed 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.679
 specify 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.739
 well in fact two of the constitutions clearly defined 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.769
 first of them 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.489
 water for human consumption 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.629
 second came for food sovereignty third ecological flow of 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.249
 100 fourth place comes the productive activities 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.140
 it is constitutional this 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.700
 now how to cede this human right to water beforehand by providing three of the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.630
 six public and community entities the water depp water management 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.870
 potable only public and community and in that sense the public 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.270
 you have to provide what you see is a fee collection 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.120
 minimum for administration, maintenance and operation but send it 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.480
 abog aprovechamiento agatha authorization for the use 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.159
 let's say free abc even if not if a person does not have 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.620
 the ability to pay 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.349
 d that's why the vital course percent up to a certain amount will be that the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.120
 Expert nine before 1 but to meet those who really do not have to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.129
 capela 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.339
 those 10 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.329
 aspects of what was more concerned in the aspect that the inter now 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.889
 guayaquil will remain according to 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.090
 the articulated and also the audits that have been made in the 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:09.620
 process that is a private entity therefore recognizes the concern is that 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:14.569
 can be more expensive face that can other municipalities privatize not 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.009
 can according to the constitution do a private management but they exercised 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.170
 drinking water 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.080
 and wastewater management doubt or wastewater treatment for 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.610
 one hundred are careless the other concern the sole authority of the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.210
 water that hunosa has proposed to talk about the executive managing other 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.070
 they say that the intercultural and plurinational council that manages 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.940
 there has been an alternative proposal of wanting to be president not 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.409
 respect and executive 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.870
 or the national water secretary that this is an executive body 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.530
 and that an intercultural and plurinational degree council was constituted 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.920
 that this is a legislative body and another 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.020
 entity that was a control entity that would be the superintendence of water 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.879
 we follow closely then the subject thank you very much for your time but of the 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.180
 that he did not talk to us live from ecuador until they see him in 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.580
 practical information and by then it was 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.400
 the contribution until next time
