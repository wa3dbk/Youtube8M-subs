don't want to go back down to the
championship<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:11.280> know<00:05:11.430> sometimes<00:05:12.120> you

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
championship but you know sometimes you

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.999 
championship but you know sometimes you
might<00:05:12.599> have<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.870> go<00:05:13.020> go<00:05:13.380> back<00:05:13.560> down<00:05:13.740> there<00:05:13.770> to

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
might have to go go back down there to

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.740 
might have to go go back down there to
get<00:05:14.130> back<00:05:14.310> up<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.639> Premiership<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.630> know

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
get back up to the Premiership you know

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.960 
get back up to the Premiership you know
if<00:05:15.840> we<00:05:15.930> do<00:05:16.050> go<00:05:16.530> back<00:05:16.560> down<00:05:16.949> and<00:05:17.220> have<00:05:17.789> another

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
if we do go back down and have another

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.399 
if we do go back down and have another
good<00:05:18.240> season<00:05:18.449> this<00:05:18.750> year<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.080> go<00:05:19.199> straight

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
good season this year and go straight

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.290 
good season this year and go straight
back<00:05:19.650> up<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.280> I<00:05:20.430> think<00:05:20.610> it'd<00:05:20.699> be<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.180> right

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
back up and I think it'd be the right

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.200 
back up and I think it'd be the right
move<00:05:21.449> for<00:05:21.509> me<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.750> stay<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.490> again<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:24.120> know

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
move for me to stay and again you know

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.610 
move for me to stay and again you know
it<00:05:24.360> depends<00:05:24.840> on<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.020> type<00:05:25.229> of<00:05:25.259> teams<00:05:25.560> that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
it depends on the type of teams that

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.140 
it depends on the type of teams that
would<00:05:25.800> come<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.490> know<00:05:26.789> whether<00:05:27.000> they

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
would come in and you know whether they

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.490 
would come in and you know whether they
do<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.389> all<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:27.690> again<00:05:27.990> those<00:05:28.110> things<00:05:28.349> are<00:05:28.470> out

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500

you know thankfully because of my

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.019 
you know thankfully because of my
experience<00:05:42.529> so<00:05:42.769> far<00:05:42.799> I<00:05:43.069> I<00:05:43.219> don't<00:05:43.519> think<00:05:43.759> I<00:05:43.849> was

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
experience so far I I don't think I was

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.389 
experience so far I I don't think I was
that<00:05:44.539> uncomfortable<00:05:45.079> coming<00:05:45.769> in<00:05:46.039> in<00:05:46.219> the

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.399 
that uncomfortable coming in in the

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.089 
that uncomfortable coming in in the
first<00:05:46.549> place<00:05:47.499> which<00:05:48.499> I<00:05:48.619> think<00:05:48.799> helped<00:05:48.979> me<00:05:49.069> a

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
first place which I think helped me a

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.599 
first place which I think helped me a
lot<00:05:49.279> in<00:05:49.339> my<00:05:49.519> first<00:05:49.849> camp<00:05:50.119> and<00:05:50.359> now<00:05:50.449> my<00:05:50.629> second

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:51.609 
lot in my first camp and now my second

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:54.579 
lot in my first camp and now my second
but<00:05:52.609> you<00:05:53.179> know<00:05:53.269> I<00:05:53.299> think<00:05:53.419> it<00:05:54.109> does<00:05:54.319> take<00:05:54.559> a

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.589 
but you know I think it does take a

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.379 
but you know I think it does take a
little<00:05:54.769> bit<00:05:54.889> of<00:05:54.979> time<00:05:55.219> to<00:05:55.429> not<00:05:55.999> only<00:05:56.149> be

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
little bit of time to not only be

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.599 
little bit of time to not only be
integrated<00:05:56.989> in<00:05:57.109> the<00:05:57.139> squad<00:05:57.499> but<00:05:57.709> also<00:05:58.429> to

00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:58.609 
integrated in the squad but also to

00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.489 
integrated in the squad but also to
learn<00:05:58.789> how<00:05:58.849> to<00:05:59.029> tell<00:05:59.299> the<00:05:59.569> national<00:06:00.079> team<00:06:00.229> play

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
learn how to tell the national team play

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.169 
learn how to tell the national team play
is<00:06:00.559> rather<00:06:00.829> than<00:06:01.069> the<00:06:01.219> way<00:06:01.339> watford<00:06:01.789> plays<00:06:01.999> and

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:02.179 
is rather than the way watford plays and

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.239 
is rather than the way watford plays and
all<00:06:02.539> those<00:06:02.749> types<00:06:02.839> of<00:06:03.139> things<00:06:03.199> are<00:06:03.469> factors

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:04.249 
all those types of things are factors

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:06.579 
all those types of things are factors
and<00:06:04.369> the<00:06:04.879> way<00:06:04.969> you<00:06:05.029> how<00:06:05.689> you<00:06:05.749> feel<00:06:06.109> as<00:06:06.319> far<00:06:06.499> as

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
and the way you how you feel as far as

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:07.929 
and the way you how you feel as far as
comfortableness<00:06:07.039> and<00:06:07.309> things<00:06:07.459> like<00:06:07.579> that<00:06:07.639> and

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
comfortableness and things like that and

hopefully i'll get a few more minutes

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.769 
hopefully i'll get a few more minutes
but<00:06:24.889> as<00:06:24.979> this<00:06:25.129> tournament<00:06:25.519> rolls<00:06:25.669> on<00:06:25.849> what's

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:26.779 
but as this tournament rolls on what's

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.909 
but as this tournament rolls on what's
been<00:06:26.929> the<00:06:27.079> hardest<00:06:27.199> thing<00:06:27.529> to<00:06:27.559> kind<00:06:27.709> of<00:06:27.799> get

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
been the hardest thing to kind of get

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.989 
been the hardest thing to kind of get
used<00:06:27.979> to<00:06:28.249> it<00:06:28.399> the<00:06:28.609> highest<00:06:28.909> level<00:06:30.969> again<00:06:31.969> i

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:31.999 
used to it the highest level again i

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.209 
used to it the highest level again i
think<00:06:32.299> it's<00:06:32.419> probably<00:06:32.539> the<00:06:32.899> mental<00:06:33.859> side<00:06:34.039> of

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
think it's probably the mental side of

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.919 
think it's probably the mental side of
it<00:06:34.309> it's<00:06:34.819> being<00:06:34.999> able<00:06:35.239> to<00:06:35.329> maintain<00:06:35.479> that

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:35.929 
it it's being able to maintain that

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.869 
it it's being able to maintain that
concentration<00:06:36.649> for<00:06:36.799> a<00:06:36.859> whole<00:06:37.039> 90<00:06:37.279> minutes<00:06:37.669> and

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:37.879 
concentration for a whole 90 minutes and

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.789 
concentration for a whole 90 minutes and
you<00:06:38.449> know<00:06:38.539> even<00:06:38.569> even<00:06:38.959> at<00:06:39.199> the<00:06:39.289> international

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:39.799 
you know even even at the international

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.089 
you know even even at the international
level<00:06:39.829> it's<00:06:40.369> just<00:06:40.729> as<00:06:40.879> just<00:06:41.149> a<00:06:41.329> similar<00:06:42.099> you
