00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
either windows media or flash I see so
essentially<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> web<00:02:18.930> server<00:02:20.060> not

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
essentially is it like a web server not

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.610 
essentially is it like a web server not
so<00:02:21.239> much<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> web<00:02:21.720> server<00:02:21.959> when<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:22.350> coming

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so much a web server when you're coming

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
so much a web server when you're coming
out<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.040> tricaster<00:02:23.850> if<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.630> have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
out of the tricaster if you do not have

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.650 
out of the tricaster if you do not have
your<00:02:25.019> own<00:02:25.170> streaming<00:02:25.980> server<00:02:26.459> ok<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.940> hook<00:02:27.510> up

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
your own streaming server ok you hook up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
your own streaming server ok you hook up
to<00:02:27.840> stream<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.170> right<00:02:28.410> content<00:02:29.130> delivery<00:02:29.459> now

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
to stream is right content delivery now

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
to stream is right content delivery now
so<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> workflow<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.690> videotape<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so the workflow is you videotape the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.220 
so the workflow is you videotape the
store<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.370> stream<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> string

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
store and stream to of what a string

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.890 
store and stream to of what a string
instrument<00:02:34.700> okay<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:36.060> good<00:02:36.209> correct<00:02:36.690> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
instrument okay well good correct that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620 
instrument okay well good correct that
you<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.769> store<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.150> TriCaster

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
you with the store on the TriCaster

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.289 
you with the store on the TriCaster
system<00:02:39.959> itself<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.280> also<00:02:41.400> sort<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
system itself and you can also sort the

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.449 
system itself and you can also sort the
screaming<00:02:42.720> archive<00:02:43.110> file<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> TriCaster

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
screaming archive file on the TriCaster

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.880 
screaming archive file on the TriCaster
well<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.720> would<00:02:45.870> order<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.769> out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
well but you would order to get it out

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.750 
well but you would order to get it out
you<00:02:47.100> would<00:02:47.190> definitely<00:02:47.489> go<00:02:47.580> through<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
you would definitely go through a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
you would definitely go through a
streaming<00:02:48.480> server<00:02:48.750> content<00:02:49.290> delivery

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
streaming server content delivery

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
streaming server content delivery
network<00:02:49.950> sure<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.880> who's<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.330> target

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
network sure so who's the target

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.690 
network sure so who's the target
audience<00:02:51.840> for<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.590> TriCaster<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:53.459> say<00:02:53.549> the

lower in the intro lower end would be

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.050 
lower in the intro lower end would be
lets<00:02:56.910> say<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.950> educational<00:02:58.950> market<00:02:59.519> the
