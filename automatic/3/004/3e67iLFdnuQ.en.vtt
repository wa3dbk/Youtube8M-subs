00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello me in my dear i thought so 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 let me have a look at my edeka today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.389
 shop a part so a small photo 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.380
 Watching some is quite happy 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:16.410
 and yes I have for 28 euros still something 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.560
 shopped is a small stock 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.150
 Buy and I have here once body 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 4 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.510
 and such a thing where I am happy if 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.279
 I live alone again because at the moment 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.580
 I always have this four position 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.660
 get super soft 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.040
 but when I'm alone again 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.630
 then there's just the three-ply 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000
 recycling paper 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.000
 I think that's clear 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.920
 environmentally aware and I need stop 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 Do not have our luxury toilet paper 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.930
 I brought some discounts and a few discounts 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 Let's see, maybe I'll do it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 get a little bit out of air and maybe do it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 I go out in the kitchen or or or 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.559
 or was right on each rhubarb 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.189
 delicious and I once had a prescription 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 with so scarce rhubarb spinach bags 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.090
 I put you to talk to a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.290
 card 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:17.369
 that was pretty tasty, too 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.000
 that's a bit cold too 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 Thing 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 I always had to be careful because one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 frozen falls when frozen is tiny 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.229
 small and too cold so i did 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.450
 one of you types in everything 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 doing anyway after a short time by 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.500
 once deep frozen kale 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.470
 I was just upset again 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.140
 kale and therefore no kale summer 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.130
 It just also deep frozen 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:53.360
 So both come in the software 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:57.149

 it still just passion fruit in the offer 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.200
 because they have a little bit about it 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.200

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.970

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.900
 power failure 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:10.140
 as not at the balcony and lose 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.910
 I would like an apple here

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
 also have to be easy once in a while 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.090
 Just slide in the oven 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:59.190
 I would also like to be skinny and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:00.690
 The crisp had never been 99 cents 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.060
 also cost the good and cheap 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.250
 croquettes and they are also vegan loud 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.230
 I ingredients list have no bearing on 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.370
 manufacturer sent but for 9 cents 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.170
 and then I have that again 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.570
 taken here were rubber lenses 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.830
 meatballs berlin citizens i had 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.570
 ever I found that really delicious 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.390
 I really like you as a burger 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.640
 taken and citizens rolls and the 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.380
 are mainly carrot and red 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.660
 Lenses yes, that's not the basis 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.160
 in the ikuwo as a base or so it is a 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.900
 a bit like soy protein with in it 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.900
 but that is pretty far behind and 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.950
 with coriander mint oregano, after all 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.380
 I thought that was pretty good 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.340
 and yes, I just got so midday 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.420
 I just sometimes that's it then 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.010
 should go fast 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.540
 and then I like those ready 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.540
 things-lasting as from porn in the oven 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.140
 from garden to garden rubber you have to 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.610
 take care there is really on it 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.620
 Blessing or vegetarian is the 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.390
 picturesque difference vegan and at 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.419
 most values swg day straub the 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.350
 are then most with chicken egg 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.390
 garden citizens where your 79 for the bavaria 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.390
 then I allowed myself this time 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.760
 I found that delicious looking as well 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.550
 quartet lemon mango and 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.990
 currants now a bit of sauce 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.520
 i could at the ingredient lists the 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.620
 but we are gigantic 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.120
 sort of thing does not recognize why that is now 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.420
 not vegan, nothing is printed in bold 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.270
 or even so if there is someone more 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.070
 I 'd like to let you know because of the 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.870
 unfortunately they had this magnus 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.820
 and so out of the assortment and soja 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.870
 is not there anymore but it is 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.760
 maybe for my figure and 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:52.710
 health also quite good so last but not least 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.540
 part is then once at ek sojadrink 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.280
 change 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.140
 I do not know why he's with the stuff 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.060
 vanilla and other specialties 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.980
 why not just oats or 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.169
 rice milk so do but I wanted 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.120
 quite often used for bananas 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.150
 milk always tastes good again 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.730
 books and other things as if you were now 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:17.669
 community makes contact and the consumer has 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.230
 to cooperate with one another and there 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:24.780
 I still have the router end so out 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:28.669
 the soymilk has no price at all 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.229
 since a 19 and the rice is drinking 41 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.430
 unfortunately we have the oat drink 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.410
 no longer was the disc from the 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.940
 I used to like to take assortment 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.340
 If I'm America I'm here 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.870
 not often but sometimes and now there's 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.280
 yes still rice and soja but then drinks 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.430
 Now I have the price war 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.350
 taken with you fascinating 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.120
 on the ingredient lists you look at 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.040
 between also just at the sojadrink and 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.360
 then at alpro it looked like there 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.030
 is then twice as many things 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.350
 the others do so per household 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.919
 always so much shit in his things 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:02.150
 purely but there was no yogi 

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:04.620
 yoghurt alternative to this 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.540
 yes see you in the next video hope 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.640
 I wish you a great day 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.260
 or at night it is super nice and sunny 

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.100
 and I will work a little bit more 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.100
 see you
