vampire<00:01:39.750> hunter<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.320> also

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
vampire hunter and and so it it also

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.490 
vampire hunter and and so it it also
could<00:01:44.509> explain<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> distance

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
could explain some of the distance

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.450 
could explain some of the distance
between<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.039> mother<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.310> daughter

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
between the mother and daughter

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
between the mother and daughter
relationship<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.690> there<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.960> secrets

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
relationship because there are secrets

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.040 
relationship because there are secrets
there<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.060> her<00:01:51.240> mother<00:01:51.450> keeps<00:01:51.780> from

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
there that that her mother keeps from

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.130 
there that that her mother keeps from
her<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.789> think<00:01:54.090> attempt<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.539> protect<00:01:54.960> her

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
her and I think attempt to protect her

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.600 
her and I think attempt to protect her
but<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:55.950> driving<00:01:56.490> them

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but it's really just driving them

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.430 
but it's really just driving them
farther<00:01:56.819> apart<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.750> it'll<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.899> interesting<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
farther apart so it'll be interesting to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.850 
farther apart so it'll be interesting to
see<00:01:58.560> how<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.399> relationship<00:01:59.700> grows<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> know

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
see how that relationship grows you know
