at<00:01:36.750> first<00:01:36.990> glance<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.920> notice<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.460> Tech

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
at first glance here you notice the Tech

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
at first glance here you notice the Tech
Deck<00:01:38.939> logo<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> metal<00:01:39.810> kopi<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
Deck logo in the metal kopi which is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
Deck logo in the metal kopi which is
pretty<00:01:40.710> cool<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> writing<00:01:41.579> surface<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pretty cool the writing surface is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.690 
pretty cool the writing surface is
fairly<00:01:43.079> smooth<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> fuzzy

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
fairly smooth but it's kind of fuzzy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
fairly smooth but it's kind of fuzzy
it's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.240> super<00:01:45.659> smooth<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.140> any<00:01:46.409> means<00:01:46.710> at

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's not super smooth by any means at

it's not super smooth by any means at
all<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.369> mini<00:01:47.640> ramp<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.060> 13<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> 3/4<00:01:49.200> inches

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
all this mini ramp is 13 and 3/4 inches

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.490 
all this mini ramp is 13 and 3/4 inches
long<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.610> N<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.090> 7<00:01:51.659> inches<00:01:51.810> wide<00:01:52.200> and

long from in to N it's 7 inches wide and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560

it's<00:01:52.860> 4<00:01:53.100> inches<00:01:53.310> tall<00:01:53.520> off<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> table<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it's 4 inches tall off the table the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's 4 inches tall off the table the
transition<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> ramp<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.399> tight

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
transition on this ramp is really tight

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
transition on this ramp is really tight
it's<00:01:56.969> very<00:01:57.299> close<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> being<00:01:57.960> too<00:01:58.350> tight<00:01:58.740> kind

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it's very close to being too tight kind

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's very close to being too tight kind
of<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> shallow<00:01:59.700> end<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> Delmar

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
of like the shallow end of the Delmar

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.250 
of like the shallow end of the Delmar
pool

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.870 

but<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> fingerboard<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.430> beret<00:02:08.700> now

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
but this is a fingerboard a beret now

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.609 
but this is a fingerboard a beret now
I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> coping<00:02:09.780> could<00:02:09.960> be<00:02:10.110> recessed

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I think the coping could be recessed

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.860 
I think the coping could be recessed
just<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.570> isn't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
just a little bit more but it isn't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.300 
just a little bit more but it isn't
really<00:02:12.960> poking<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.680> far<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.950> it's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
really poking out so far that it's

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.130 
really poking out so far that it's
annoying<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> poking<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:15.870> quite<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
annoying but it is poking out quite a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.460 
annoying but it is poking out quite a
bit

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
bit

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
bit
one<00:02:16.710> thing<00:02:16.950> though<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.370> ramp<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.880> very<00:02:18.450> very

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
one thing though this ramp is very very

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
one thing though this ramp is very very
light<00:02:19.020> when<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.620> used<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> smooth<00:02:20.520> surface

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
light when it's used on a smooth surface

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.430 
light when it's used on a smooth surface
like<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> countertop<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.380> gonna<00:02:22.620> move<00:02:24.440> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
like a countertop it is gonna move but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.810 
like a countertop it is gonna move but
we're<00:02:25.740> used<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:26.460> Tech<00:02:26.670> Deck

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
we're used to that with Tech Deck

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.240 
we're used to that with Tech Deck
obstacles<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> sliding<00:02:28.230> obstacles<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.040> easy

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
obstacles and sliding obstacles are easy

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.790 
obstacles and sliding obstacles are easy
to<00:02:29.550> fix<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.000> ramp<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.420> fairly<00:02:30.960> flat<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.590> does

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
to fix the ramp is fairly flat it does

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.350 
to fix the ramp is fairly flat it does
kind<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.160> wobble<00:02:32.460> but<00:02:32.670> once<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:32.970> throw<00:02:33.150> some

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
kind of wobble but once you throw some

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
kind of wobble but once you throw some
non<00:02:33.510> sliders<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.650> won't<00:02:34.860> matter

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
non sliders on there it won't matter

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
non sliders on there it won't matter
anyway<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.030> isn't<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.330> too<00:02:36.630> wobbly

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
anyway but it isn't really too wobbly

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.210 
anyway but it isn't really too wobbly
which<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.350> pretty<00:02:37.560> good<00:02:37.740> for<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:38.010> mass-produced

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
which is pretty good for a mass-produced

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.430 
which is pretty good for a mass-produced
item<00:02:39.060> let's<00:02:39.300> take<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> look<00:02:39.720> underneath<00:02:39.960> here

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
item let's take a look underneath here

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
item let's take a look underneath here
these<00:02:40.740> are<00:02:40.950> built<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:42.000> weird<00:02:42.240> as

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
these are built really really weird as

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.270 
these are built really really weird as
you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.990> not<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> normal<00:02:43.710> custom

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you can see not like a normal custom

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040 
you can see not like a normal custom
ramp<00:02:44.490> would<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.820> built<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.840> Tech

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
ramp would be built but it is the Tech

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.690 
ramp would be built but it is the Tech
Deck<00:02:46.200> ramp<00:02:46.470> after<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.310> held<00:02:47.550> together

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
Deck ramp after all it's held together

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.090 
Deck ramp after all it's held together
with<00:02:47.910> little<00:02:48.420> screws<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.710> don't<00:02:49.920> see

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
with little screws and I don't see

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100 
with little screws and I don't see
evidence<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.670> any<00:02:50.910> glue<00:02:51.270> anywhere<00:02:51.840> there's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
evidence of any glue anywhere there's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.620 
evidence of any glue anywhere there's
none<00:02:52.290> seeping<00:02:52.770> out<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.820> what<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.240> so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
none seeping out so it is what it is so

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.390 
none seeping out so it is what it is so
overall<00:02:54.990> what<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.410> think<00:02:55.470> about<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.100> ramp

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
overall what do I think about this ramp

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.160 
overall what do I think about this ramp
this<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> hard<00:02:57.300> ramp<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.750> review

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
this is really a hard ramp to review

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.440 
this is really a hard ramp to review
because<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> wooden<00:02:59.580> ramp<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.120> every

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
because it is a wooden ramp but every

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.180 
because it is a wooden ramp but every
time<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.690> see<00:03:01.050> something<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.740> want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> point

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
time I see something and I want to point

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.950 
time I see something and I want to point
out<00:03:02.340> something<00:03:02.760> negative<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.300> kind<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.630> remind

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
out something negative I kind of remind

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.050 
out something negative I kind of remind
myself<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.830> tech<00:03:05.040> tech<00:03:05.250> ramp<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.820> can

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
myself that it's a tech tech ramp so can

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.730 
myself that it's a tech tech ramp so can
I<00:03:06.090> really<00:03:06.360> compare<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> custom-made

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
I really compare it to a custom-made

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320 
I really compare it to a custom-made
ramp<00:03:08.010> I'm<00:03:08.250> gonna<00:03:08.490> be<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> hundred<00:03:08.850> percent

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
ramp I'm gonna be a hundred percent

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.510 
ramp I'm gonna be a hundred percent
honest<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> well<00:03:10.470> made<00:03:10.500> wooden<00:03:11.190> mini
