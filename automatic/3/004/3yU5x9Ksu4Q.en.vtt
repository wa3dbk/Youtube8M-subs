00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.030
 your new plant is now with you 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.350
 arrived 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.690
 our technicians prepare the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.860
 staging the profiles and all components 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.340
 standing in front of working platform and staff 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.110
 ready 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.110
 the assembly can begin 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.590
 fast is the location and the 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.920
 Orientation of the new HP system 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.920
 certainly 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.219
 the ensuing Calibrate it takes 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.300
 Careful work modern measuring instruments 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.690
 simplify the correct positioning 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.969
 the support same is true also 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.969
 Covering the building with narrow boats 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.770
 the exact lot is right aligned 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.080
 by adjusting the headrests 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.160
 wear the entire plant and become 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.160
 firmly anchored in the ground 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.040
 can be clamped with flange 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.770
 Cover carrier from the HPV box easily 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.510
 and safely on the supports or on 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.510
 attach to other steel beams 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.439
 The crane track will now be ready for installation 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.299
 the blanket carrier prepared by the 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.159
 a new shock connection can be the crane track 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.460
 for the first time at each position 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.189
 be burdened so no profile shock 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.049
 self- locking screws 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.320
 simplify the assembly of the clamp 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.600
 Which 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 the new hd can hang from the top 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.350
 simply be used in the profile 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.270
 also for existing systems for plants 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 with several cranes there is a sanding 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 management 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.920
 To mount are cap landing gear 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720
 limitation and cable firmly comes cable 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 Ladder lead the tow line of the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.190
 main power supply in the profile 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.620
 crane track is finished in almost 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.489
 it follows the laying of the line in the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.340
 box 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.930
 before it goes up to the assembly 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 striking the lid carrier 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.270
 now only the sick are missing 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 Movement of the crane bridge is through the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.690
 new strong many and suspension still 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.690
 more comfortable and picks up 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.280
 the heart of your hd system is ours 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.959
 but compact the electric chains 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 Search is powerful and fast 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.560
 assembled 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.519
 the new crane bridge is now in the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.519
 suspended under the crane track 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.570
 a few electrical work done 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.850
 now it is only in review 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.410
 first commissioning our subject 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.440
 Fitters for the exam 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.090
 knowledgeable not equal by should 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.930
 be an expert required 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.260
 They would like to hire them for this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.260
 new hd system that we move more
