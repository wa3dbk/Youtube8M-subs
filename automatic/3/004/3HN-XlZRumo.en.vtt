00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.520
 then look today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.900
 of work 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.210
 no 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.340
 mass effect 3 is an action rpg released on 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.410
 9 March 2012 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.190
 developed by bioware and came out for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.199
 playstation 3 xbox 360 and pc 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 the video game is obviously the sequel of 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.230
 mass effect 2 released in the now distant 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.910
 2010 the title to a decidedly drift 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.890
 much more action than the previous ones 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.900
 episodes that present unprecedented modalities 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:10.340
 multiplayer that we will deepen later 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:12.350
 better despite the title in question 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.210
 is really noteworthy 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.939
 many fans stayed with the bitterness in 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.070
 mouth because our beloved is simple 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.229
 electronics to grab the most 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.299
 part of the audience has ingeniously decided 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.430
 to pump the as mentioned before 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.780
 action component already present in forts 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670
 doses in the second chapter 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.439
 fortunately the developers have 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.300
 chosen to let the players decide the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.750
 kind of gameplay against the simple 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.330
 modality 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.040
 the first is action the clashes will have 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.470
 a medium difficulty and we will not be able to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.690
 interact with the plot in any way 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.040
 second is the rpg mode as well as the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.030
 how we played i 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.130
 previous chapters 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 the clashes will be of medium difficulty 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.510
 and we can interact entirely with the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 plot the third is the story 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.780
 this mode is characterized by 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.730
 full interaction with the plot and from 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.670
 fights with minimal difficulty 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.500
 like any self-respecting RPG in the beginning 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.940
 of the game we will be able to customize the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 our character with somatic features 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.550
 at its origin and then choose one 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.229
 class among which the engineer said 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.090
 soldier the sentinel and cursor 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.129
 the mini-game scout 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.870
 of the glaze scan also is 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.060
 been modified to render the whole 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.700
 less boring but unfortunately it was a 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.280
 attempt goes in fact in these phases of 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.740
 gameplay will be extremely 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 and without stimuli and certainly any 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.620
 leaks from the raiders alerted by the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 our scans 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 branch g 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.730
 throws it 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.620
 six months have passed since the events 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.540
 of the second mass effect and apparently 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.550
 the raiders invaded the Milky Way 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 to end all life forms at 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.480
 inside we'll be able to escape from 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.280
 land under attack from land entrances 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 they will not be so lucky 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.340
 thus begins a struggle for the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.200
 survival of mankind while 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.700
 we will be busy finding a way 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.800
 to stop the raiders once for 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.050
 all the plot will be full of shots of 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.270
 scene epic moments and very often 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.690
 dramatic and like in every chapter of the 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.130
 saga 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.260
 here too we could fly ours 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 allies who will support us in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.130
 battle as cars and ida e 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.500
 undertake relationships of various kinds 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.300
 with them unfortunately in this chapter 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.670
 we will not find the great variety of 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.070
 secondary characters present in 2 of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.320
 allies in fact will be very few 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.390
 they will be little charismatic and almost not 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.450
 it has interesting aside from a few small ones 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.450
 exception 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.470
 the graphics leave a lot of impressed with 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.209
 play of lights and colors 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.950
 the faces are shaped almost to 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.900
 perfection and the spectacle of the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.350
 environments will leave us very often in the mouth 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.300
 open 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.069
 the combat system remained 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.870
 virtually unchanged is certainly 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.970
 removal of heavy weapons like i 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.920
 cannons and grenade launchers will be anyway 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.290
 available within the maps but yes 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.790
 will be able to use are once like 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.290
 in the previous chapters we will be able to 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.540
 check the powers of our two 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.820
 allies and our protagonist for 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.680
 form effective war strategies o 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.200
 to concentrate all the fire on 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.310
 particularly difficult enemies 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 the artificial intelligence of ours 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.910
 companions and enemies has been improved 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.799
 but not enough 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
 since sometimes we will find the characters 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.800
 stuck in the walls or see again 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.570
 continuously the same actions 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.140
 improving all that 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.000
 surrounds 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.590
 the title is not affected by serious problems 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.090
 technicians if it were not for some 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.130
 deburring like animations 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.720
 cumbersome declines in framerates e 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.370
 endless uploads 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.620
 nothing to worry about though even if a 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.620
 sometimes this is very annoying 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.759
 every half an hour 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.090
 reason why neither a boat that has 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.639
 disgust like 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.199
 school as mentioned earlier in this 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.030
 chapter is also present in multiplayer 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.530
 four-player cooperative where 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.389
 we should defend ourselves from several 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.430
 types of enemies and complete 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.410
 unfortunately various objectives will be present 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.720
 just a morality and it will be in the long run 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 and repetitive and boring even if we have a 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:15.669
 arrangement of numerous characters and weapons 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:17.260
 with which to address the networks for 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.330
 conclude I would like to talk a little about 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.949
 final for final was for many one 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.870
 big disappointment for a simple reason 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.350
 not everyone has really understood it a 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.630
 background 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.460
 in fact, as often happens in games 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.740
 with more epilogues there is always a good one 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.720
 bad one and sometimes not true here not 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.700
 the developers will be exactly like that 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.320
 put us in front of three choices and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.450
 consequence of the conclusions that 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.400
 obviously I will not reveal you as said 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.650
 first we will believe we are in front of 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.139
 a final choice good or final banana 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.940
 bad while with subterfuges the 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.949
 player will be deceived is forced to 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.510
 make the wrong choices conditional 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.389
 psychologically from various elements 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.130
 above all scenographic I stop here 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.840
 not to reveal too much to those who do not have 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.400
 still finished I bought the game but 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.990
 you are curious to know what it is 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.910
 speaking I recommend you read 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.270
 the article by eurogamer.it in the 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.270
 Description 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.309
 to conclude I say that mass effect 3 is 

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:18.589
 a noteworthy title as well as a worthy one 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.360
 final for the saga and consequently it 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.669
 I advise everyone as much as lovers 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.499
 of science fiction to ddps lovers e 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.659
 especially for rpg lovers 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.219
 this title is a real gem but 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.779
 before playing it I recommend 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.759
 complete the first two chapters 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.989
 to fully understand the plot in 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.089
 every facet of it 

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:36.979
 what about the first five review 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.019
 remember to put me like and get me 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.179
 know what you think with a comment 

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:44.469
 as always I greet you and refer you to 

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:44.469
 next video hello to all guys 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.070
