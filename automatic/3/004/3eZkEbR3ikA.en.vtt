00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.449
 where I wanted to know it 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.449
 that is what it means 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.339
 greatest importance 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.829
 and so happy for the last time 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.999
 Of course, Google will become Android 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.580
 Reason is sure it will bring you 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.119
 a bit tired 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.579
 The courage lent the courage to persuade the researchers to readiness 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.050
 Conviction by a bit of courage 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 Duisburg - also my own investigations several speakers of the left 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.740
 for offered 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.650
 he is and a little 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.890
 facilitated 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 we have 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.750
 we would not have done anyway without this compactness yet 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.260
 compact week to week more compact I've said degree you have to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.560
 against Freiburg are very compact percent and machines 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.100
 he did not call me 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 and when we talked back then, he just said his opinion 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.300
 No longer planned in the long term and of course the press were then 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.880
 Turkey also wanted me at the Arber 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.770
 I have never said as I have said 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.830
 but stop 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 he did not say anything and Volkswagen 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.569
 is he still not keeping up with my future I'm just behind me and 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.750
 just the deal burst 4 in 4 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 that was what it did when it happened that it started 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.030
 what would have happened then what is going on somewhere million million adds up 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.420
 Trio was my respect for the opponent but Freiburg solved and by percent 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.150
 Müller percent off the project from what is not everything and what gets even more 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
 problem-free 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.200
 TS 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 a normal person a normal FC St it is a serious 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.400
 At times, businessmen are representatives of all 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.220
 but since he sure is quite normal that's exactly what you want to know like a whole 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.979
 becomes normal human being 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 Percent results 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.980
 Anja Schierz against strong teams are very strong 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.090
 So a very strong team 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.599
 I expect you one way or the other 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.609
 at the game Switzerland are «very very strong team - maybe for 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.129
 Example strongest evidence 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.969
 8th 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.040
 And in this regard, I'm not what 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 that concerns 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.209
 and I think that we Detlef Dyer poor and with a lot of self-confidence 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.490
 with a lot of self-confidence 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.569
 a sure remedy 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.049
 great self-confidence 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 who go these tasks 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.749
 have stolen 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.950
 in some parts 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.739
 he also makes mistakes 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.510
 Now a little over a million are being talked about 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.839
 Merger of Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank expect 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.009
 investor 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.009
 who cares about everything or nothing 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.279
 No
