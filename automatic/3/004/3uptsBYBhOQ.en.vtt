00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:11.070
 Hello everyone today I hit the road 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.120
 car market for disassembly bought the necessary 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 the main details are top priority and now 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.460
 go through the points that I took and how much 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 so here we are here is our spar 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.840
 this one is a good one 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.680
 state it's normally delicious 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.050
 Here are laid here set as I wanted 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 principle 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.629
 so that this is all not arching 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.020
 glasses principle leveled he left here 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.840
 we are not much now prokinul yesterday 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 I measured it on the back door with an ax there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 control point here is our sheet 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 right-left I measured it 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.080
 okay everything is there breaking 2 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.080
 millimeter is generally not significant here 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.720
 so that everything is good in general 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.799
 this one 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:19.080
 boil his party spars it costs 300 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.250
 hryvnia this piece yes then I took 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 here is our beam , we have a double 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.170
 here comes the bottom frame under the radiator and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.659
 front as if they took the bolt together with the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.150
 cushion pad is also good here 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.329
 able ok it's all enough 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 because pachuka right there trivia and so 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:53.579
 the principle is that here in general balcony to me 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:57.659
 but gave the assembly for 250 and a pillow for 50 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.990
 hryvnia so then I took the front 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990
 frame 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:13.080
 this is our so-called screen 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:24.330
 able, I'm not bent, that's all 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:27.870
 here all the goose well I took it for 250 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.910
 if I'm not mistaken the same 250 hryvnia 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.450
 or 300 well in general 1 out of 2 there he 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 I threw a little bit further 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.800
 bumper us goes bumper of course we 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 turned out not cheap 500 hryvnia bumper 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.870
 on it stands here it goes with us 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:57.660
 amplifiers here with turn signals immediately 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.180
 here's a bumper mount 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.260
 the only one here is the anchorage there and 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 solder 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.810
 we will mount another unfortunately not 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.840
 Well it was something like this as well, bumper 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:18.330
 on good here and I took 2 new headlights 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.440
 of course went up here than well what 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.610
 we go 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:35.880
 metal right here is the reflector 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:40.680
 here and already stupidity as if it will be 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:44.209
 already all for a long time if again no one 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.400
 will move in then enough of these formans 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.910
 for a long time as the price turned out 200 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 hryvnia 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:04:01.720
 1 so and of course I took the hood 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.660
 hood of course condition almost 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.650
 perfect not something on it is not ummati the whole 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.850
 smooth 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.850
 all kayfovoy 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:23.960
 removed from the dowry of the German well, fresh 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:27.130
 let's say the price of the hood we got 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.009
 800 hryvnia another person's business is good 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:36.050
 I offered him 401 there 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:38.389
 firecrackers are here and here are the places 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.570
 here is where we go 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.750
 he has fastenings here a little bit 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:48.699
 was bent in places so he conceived for 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.620
 400 hryvnia principle I think that what 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:55.880
 to be engaged in more rivetting 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.229
 hood better hood put already good 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.470
 the state is of course Chinese 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:06.349
 the hood he stands too he pronounced up to 1000 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.900
 hryvnia well , it 's not native doctors 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:13.970
 will be much better and more interesting and 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.479
 better metal and gaps will all be exactly 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.050
 immediately everything will match everything will be fine 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:24.409
 That will be on all much 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.770
 easier it is all things well, in general is such a 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.770
 here is the situation 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.070
 with the details left neither take the head-on 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:38.960
 glass is our lattice before the lattice here it is 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:46.800
 there is a grill down under the skirt 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:51.750
 Here she ordered it on Tuesday 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:59.120
 two days I will bring here the studios among the wines 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:02.910
 no iv put in a new price so 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.360
 lattice put a new skirt 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.000
 which we from the bottom where the principle is simple 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.660
 then we do the whole thing by drifting to them ourselves 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.370
 roughly speaking because iron is not so 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.100
 so problematic for straightening so well 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:24.270
 that everything in general is my task now 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.140
 next I need to pull out now 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:33.510
 from here the motor put it away 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:34.130
 so that you can get here 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.450
 here here 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:42.110
 to trim this into all places and 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:47.460
 could all be welded here 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:50.790
 neatly beautiful to do here motor 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.810
 we will need to clean now but clean 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:57.770
 the motor is not difficult to be all together 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:02.310
 unscrewing here is the back pillow 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:05.130
 drive tidy sideways and hoses and 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.670
 the teeth nipples which wires go 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:12.230
 to the motor remove all the side 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:19.640
 disconnect and pull out 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:24.380
 motor from here, in principle, something like this 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:29.360
 there is collecting motors starting already trim 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:37.210
 our spar docked with our purchased 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:37.210
 a piece well, we work on
