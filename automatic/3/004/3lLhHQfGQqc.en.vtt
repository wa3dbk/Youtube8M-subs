00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 good gives me 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.260
 know what is the hydraulics of the no if 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.320
 has another name to call it 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:25.840
 the hydraulics of the tailgate of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.290
 car the trunk has gone down and it has 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.290
 match 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.850
 it's the first thing now I have to say that 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.470
 I do it on that side precisely because 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.650
 this is the third time that part does not 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.710
 I know why if he pulls more on that side or not 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.809
 I know for what reason but I would from 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.809
 the little piece does not 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 of the little pie this little button 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.430
 and the old ones in their day of fasting sun 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.760
 Screw the same thing that I'm going to do 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.560
 now that it would not cost me much to go to 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.740
 scrapped because a small box of 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.080
 scrapping is worth zero comma but the screw 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.300
 It is nonpartisan, it was inside, let's hope 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.670
 that I can not communicate again 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.570
 So why do I know three four or five 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 I do not remember anymore 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.600
 I do not remember how I took it out and it was 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090
 giving him for nothing for what was 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 giving you inside with a pointer 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 giving him a hammer to say so 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.160
 I'm going to do now at least good and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 the screw has been broken so what 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.000
 what I'm going to do is going to be an easy solution 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.570
 because as I was saying go to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 scrapping to buy another one piece of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.619
 these costs zero coma but I have ago 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.160
 closest to my house is to martÃ­n de la 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.910
 vega and it took then between you get well 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.890
 Stay still, what do I know about 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.310
 two hours between and return more hours today 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.690
 such and such is and no no no yes for the labor 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.920
 so I'm going to make it as done 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.360
 forever 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 a screw of sheet metal 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 and so I 'm going to put it again for it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.950
 the screw is going to be one of these if it's 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 something a little long the same you see everything 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.930
 better 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.890
 is going to be one of these that are these 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.380
 who bring granaditas with rubber to put 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.090
 veneers on the roofs uralitas and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.890
 coatings and things of these good 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.580
 Well one of these bases are threaded 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.750
 sheet so more or less I think that 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.840
 it was one of this what the other used 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.520
 time I will first remove the screw 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 what is there in 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.230
 in the car on the car sheet because 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.030
 maybe now it gets a little bigger 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.250
 the hole and it's not worth me so I'm going to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.380
 check it first and so I already know the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.470
 exact screw that I will not do that 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.630
 release it and then remove the head 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.150
 that I have stuck there that is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.300
 small and work lost so I'm going to 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.350
 go check it out and first 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.740
 and so he assured me 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.510
 well, to put the or remove has been 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.120
 meter not remove 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.860
 the piece that was left has not been 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.290
 very difficult because I have given him the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.450
 auto hammer tap has also not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.290
 had to do a lot of force with the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.560
 botador or pompom has fallen punch and goes 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 within two or three inside good 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.050
 this I have with eye this base that had 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.970
 arrived just in case but 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:36.350
 it's like that I have nothing clear 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.810
 we cut off his little head 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.180
 we cut off his head because if not 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.160
 excels a lot could have left over head 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.270
 and all 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.600
 what I'm going to do 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.650
 we are not going to take his head 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.090
 is going to be taking a piece 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.769
 to the west pivot 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.680
 a piece that I think was for the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.900
 sun the other time and say hello to the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.790
 head 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.470
 if I'm going to cut my head and then he wants 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.439
 drop the asparagus and joseba is going to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.440
 burn anything hard took a piece to the 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.200
 to the piece 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.030
 radial and come cutting 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.940
 it's worth it, we've already cut it 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.090
 I do not even want to say what I can 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.760
 burn right now so stay 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.910
 there 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.550
 and the other is going to go up as it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.099
 well alone 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.099
 so come to the and that to vote 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.510
 to solve it as mystery has 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.020
 because we put the head nothing more than 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.020
 confronted 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.220
 centered more or less even dot of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.220
 verve 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.539
 the endurance 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.990
 I can lower the screen if not no 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.900
 I see, God , we're already like 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.270
 we are always going to clean a little 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.000
 we have given you a little point these 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.310
 screws are of as well as steel 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.330
 galvanized a thing like that and there is fucked 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.250
 of 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.570
 and then there has to be a big cord 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.810
 Well, yes, it grabs you but for 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.730
 hold back a little because as you 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.730
 it costs as well 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.280
 you go 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.280
 I'm just going to check that it's centered 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.620
 and at the moment that 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.660
 and I think that more or less there was 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.660
 right 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.610
 it's important that I go a little bit right 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:46.809
 so that the hydraulic works well 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.129
 because if you work the crooked hydraulic 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.219
 TV is going to start again because the 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.430
 gate looks like it does not weigh but it weighs more 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.320
 what it looks like 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.780
 and if I do not remove the hydraulics and 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.270
 raise him with his hand to know if 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.660
 it weighs not weighs let's see a little bit that I 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.660
 I said there 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.920
 put him right 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.920
 now to see who is or canada 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.580
 whoever is playing now but good 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.580
 I think more or less 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:25.740
 and I have more or less there I have 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.539
 so nothing I've done a little with 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.539
 the other side and we finished jumping 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.539
 d 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.529
 I think that's the way it is, so 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.849
 nothing 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.849
 to soldiers has said 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.480
 if you want 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.659
 we turn around 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.000
 well I did not say it I did not say it but 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.200
 I say I do not need to say it I think 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.740
 which needless to say 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.060
 but to apply them 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.060
 to see how I can put it for what
