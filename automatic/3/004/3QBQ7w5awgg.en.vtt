00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
there are two ways to make this sound

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.040 
there are two ways to make this sound
method<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> D<00:00:30.449> sound<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:31.019> your

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
method one you make a D sound with your

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
method one you make a D sound with your
tongue<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.540> tongue<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> roof

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
tongue you put your tongue to the roof

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
tongue you put your tongue to the roof
of<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.530> mouth<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> build<00:00:35.820> up

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
of your mouth and then you build up

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.400 
of your mouth and then you build up
pressure<00:00:36.270> behind<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.750> using<00:00:37.110> only<00:00:37.260> your

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
pressure behind you using only your

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.840 
pressure behind you using only your
lungs<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.190> voice<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
lungs and not your voice and then you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
lungs and not your voice and then you
release<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.210> pressure<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.989> remember<00:00:40.649> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
release that pressure and remember what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
release that pressure and remember what
the<00:00:40.920> sound<00:00:41.160> by<00:00:41.309> itself<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.090> quiet

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the sound by itself is pretty quiet

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600 
the sound by itself is pretty quiet
trying<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.469> loud<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:43.770> possible<00:00:44.250> or

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
sound can be when plugged will be to be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
sound can be when plugged will be to be
honest<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.940> sound<00:01:03.149> isn't<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
honest this sound isn't really that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
honest this sound isn't really that
useful<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.530> its<00:01:04.680> own<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> add<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
useful on its own but when you add it in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
useful on its own but when you add it in
with<00:01:05.790> another<00:01:05.970> bass<00:01:06.299> drum<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.840> sound

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
with another bass drum it can sound

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
with another bass drum it can sound
magnificent<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> hollow<00:01:08.580> kick<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.180> be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
magnificent so the hollow kick can be

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.520 
magnificent so the hollow kick can be
used<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.869> different<00:01:09.900> kinds<00:01:10.500> of

beatboxing in all different genres but
it<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.750> shines<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.530> doing<00:01:13.710> fast

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
technical beats and here are some

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.179 
technical beats and here are some
practice<00:01:15.960> beats<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.530> demonstrate<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
practice beats that demonstrate the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.920 
practice beats that demonstrate the
power<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.670> sound<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.479> here's<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> first

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
power of this sound so here's the first

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
power of this sound so here's the first
one<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.229> second<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:31.820> now<00:01:32.820> let<00:01:32.970> me

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
one and the second one now let me

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
one and the second one now let me
compare<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> first<00:01:33.780> beat<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> without

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
compare the first beat with and without

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
compare the first beat with and without
the<00:01:35.009> sound<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.579> first<00:01:35.939> whip<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:41.869> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the sound so we first whip this out and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.190 
the sound so we first whip this out and
now<00:01:43.079> without<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 

hopefully<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> notice<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.759> beat<00:01:51.000> was

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
hopefully you notice which beat was
