 a very entertaining game where we have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 as a protagonist kirby I do not know how 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 describe it appropriately but 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 I'll say it's a pink balloon with eyes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 feet and hands 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 'I want and have the ability to fly 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 absorb and shoot what it absorbed but 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.059
 what stands out about this character is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 his ability to copy the powers of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 the enemies that absorbs what it does 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 a very entertaining game the series 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 entitled Kirby of the stars is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.829
 I say captain because your ship 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.110
 he presented faults there he meets soccer two 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.910

 Kirby must face the monsters 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.890
 hired by the king diritti a series 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 entertaining but aimed at an audience 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 more childish so he left in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 optional recommendation to those who want 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 see her 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.370
 our next game is sonic the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.640
 known the blue iso that does not require 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.770
 a very extensive presentation his games 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.080
 are mostly adventure and the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 speed is how striking this game 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.450
 It is very entertaining and dynamic at the same time 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.150
 since being such a fast game 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 You must be very attentive and have good 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.880
 reflexes the good series to tell the truth 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 sonica has had varied adaptations 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.290
 one of its versions where it has a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.570
 musical group with their brothers but 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.610
 let's talk about sonic x that in my 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.160
 opinion is the best adaptation to series 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 who has had a good animation 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.030
 characters of the games and not to mention 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.580
 good action scenes where the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.429
 villain is the German doctor a series 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.950
 recommended for all public now you 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.320
 it's the turn of street fighter 2 on 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.929
 known fighting game here you must 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.780
 fight with different fighters to 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.729
 be the best of the tournament and stop the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.239
 villain of turn that changes depending 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.549
 the saga this game has stages of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.110
 very entertaining bonus in addition to 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.900
 funny endings for 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 the character without mentioning a style of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.700
 fight very careful for his time as well 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.800
 what sonic has had varied 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.720
 adaptations to series being the most 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.330
 horrible the gringa adaptation of this 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.240
 series just so you can imagine how ugly 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.820
 he was the protagonist there is guy d 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 however the Japanese adaptation is 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.230
 leads to the credits this time due to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.570
 your good story character details 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 very well maintained keeping the essence 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.040
 of the game and without mentioning that it was more 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.060
 realistic in a certain way since the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.490
 protagonists 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.520
 it's okay to say jurgen took time 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.620
 learn to master techniques without a doubt 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.510
 good series but this one for public more 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.700
 adult due to the content of the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 violent and material scenes 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.600
 gothic to continue we have to sengoku 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.730
 based an excellent game of style 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.980
 crowdfunding this game is about fights 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 of nations where you must go invading 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.709
 others to get the power of them 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.290
 although you can also make alliances on 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.350
 game style is very addictive you can 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.130
 make multiple combos exceeding 500 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 seeds 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.780
 besides that each character has 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.540
 different abilities and a movement 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.240
 final that will create an orgy of deaths to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.210
 the enemies at the end of each stage 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.850
 You must fight with the person in charge of said 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.460
 nation however may some 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.520
 they consist of very powerful subjects who 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.770
 fight against you before them their 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.720
 Anime counterpart is one of the best 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.960
 adaptations that history follows there 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.400
 of the game with some slight changes 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.830
 It has excellent music and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.660
 epic battles the truth I do not have much 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.730
 to add since it's simply a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.040
 very good series that you should not miss 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.860
 If you liked the game see the series since 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.080
 has a good value in my opinion our 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.900
 next game is the king of fighters 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.820
 This well-known game of fights deals 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.160
 to beat fights in groups of three 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.290
 sometimes being four and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.690
 face the different teams 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
 to win the title of the king of the fight 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.700
 although in each tournament there is always a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.700
 hidden reason for their creation the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.040
 characters are very charismatic and the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.500
 very intense fights over 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.050
 in the latest versions where you can 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.560
 do mega hyper with two where will you be 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.480
 hitting your opponent for three hours 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.910
 his series is rather titled works 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.070
 king of fighters another dais this 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.710
 miniseries since each episode does not last 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.630
 More than 10 minutes counts different 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.000
 stories which are located 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.040
 before coss maximum I was shocked though 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.620
 This is not considered an original part 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.720
 of history no chapter has to 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.940
 see with the previous one each one counts 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.670
 unique story with a beginning and a 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.920
 final within it has a good 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.810
 animation although their fights are short 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.720
 what leaves a lot to be desired 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.750
 Still recommended for anyone who likes 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.840
 this good game with this we finished the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.270
