00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.539
 All right 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hello Marilene 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.509
 today we are going to talk about the movement that makes 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 part of everything 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.480
 The crossover is one of the most 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 cool in my opinion the one that you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.490
 let your opponent always look for 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 you get space to attack 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.559
 space to throw 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 see I use and practice a lot and train 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 Good to make this video 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.969
 Look there coaching to start this. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 tutorial let's work on the movement in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 yes, how does it work? 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.460
 to the left of the front and crosses the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.920
 our front is entitled to the Kusaba phrase 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:05.130
 understood the left is right 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 This is the movement you can do there. 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.460
 A little dance is a beautiful thing. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.430
 you will begin until the coordination in the feet 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 before you begin to cross the ball and do 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.700
 a movement with hands and all the same 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.300
 Time, now, it's the same for you. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.850
 motion but in slow motion 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.400
 you understand how it works. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.150
 crossing the ball with your legs so 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.990
 ask ahead and cross the ball in your 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.810
 front the little foot forward and cross ball 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 in front of you 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 Okay, remember, the dance is very good. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 because you can coordinate the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.180
 movement of the arms with the leg 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.700
 now the movement by complete crosses 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 ball 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.350
 try a visitation movement in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 end your movement and train 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.390
 repeating the movement by changing and 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.180
 working your foot movement 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.730
 coordinating the feet 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 do this repeatedly and this is a 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 exercise you can do and not 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.930
 you necessarily need a block 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.069
 basketball to practice this 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.370
 exercise is like reviewing the use for 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.319
 warm up and in my opinion is the movement 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.200
 The coolest you have to learn. 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:53.569
