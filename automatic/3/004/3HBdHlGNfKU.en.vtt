more complete defender at left-back I've

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.610 
more complete defender at left-back I've
contro<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.450> possibly<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.230> best

left-back in the game because there

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.590 
left-back in the game because there
aren't<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> many
