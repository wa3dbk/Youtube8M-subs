00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
vanilla minecraft so this means is that

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.879 
vanilla minecraft so this means is that
when<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.550> type<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.389> name<00:00:10.200> will<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.590> colored

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
when you type that name will be colored

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
when you type that name will be colored
and<00:00:11.130> if<00:00:11.280> you're<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.790> multiplayer<00:00:12.480> LAN<00:00:12.870> or

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
and if you're on a multiplayer LAN or

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.709 
and if you're on a multiplayer LAN or
vanilla<00:00:13.590> server<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.099> something<00:00:14.309> whatever<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
vanilla server or something whatever the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.630 
vanilla server or something whatever the
name<00:00:16.020> above<00:00:16.289> your<00:00:16.500> head<00:00:16.859> will<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.100> collected

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
name above your head will be collected

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.269 
name above your head will be collected
so<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.150> very<00:00:18.539> simple<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.830> two

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
so it's very simple it's just two

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
so it's very simple it's just two
commands<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.260> actually

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
commands the first one is actually

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.410 
commands the first one is actually
making<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:24.140> /scoreboard<00:00:26.449> teams<00:00:27.449> add

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
making it so do /scoreboard teams add

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.799 
making it so do /scoreboard teams add
I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.660> call<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.410> am<00:00:32.390> then<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
I'm going to call this one I am then it

I'm going to call this one I am then it
created<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.820> set

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

the<00:00:36.210> color<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.579> /scoreboard<00:00:38.660> team's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:45.289> color<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> have

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and then color then you're going to have

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720 
and then color then you're going to have
to<00:00:48.270> choose<00:00:48.500> color<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> hit<00:00:50.129> tab<00:00:50.370> it'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to choose color if you hit tab it'll

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.290 
to choose color if you hit tab it'll
show<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.920> case<00:00:52.920> Cayenne<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
show you all them in case Cayenne is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.529 
show you all them in case Cayenne is
actually<00:00:54.989> dark<00:00:55.730> aqua<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.910> that's<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
actually dark aqua so then that's it so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually dark aqua so then that's it so
I'm<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.590> ahead<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.890> join<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:11.430> as

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
just a quick and simple tutorial on how

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.389 
just a quick and simple tutorial on how
to<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.820> tune<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.750> next<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.399> see

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to do this and tune in next time to see

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.389 
to do this and tune in next time to see
a<00:01:57.979> basic<00:01:58.979> money<00:01:59.939> system<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.899> guess<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> kill

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a basic money system I guess or a kill

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.850 
a basic money system I guess or a kill
system<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.060> something<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.860> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
system or something like that it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.670 
system or something like that it's
really<00:02:05.280> simple<00:02:05.460> again<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.270> scoreboards<00:02:07.079> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
really simple again it scoreboards so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.759 
really simple again it scoreboards so
tune<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.099> next<00:02:08.129> time<00:02:08.489> bye
