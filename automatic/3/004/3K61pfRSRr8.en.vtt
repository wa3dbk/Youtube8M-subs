00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
judge of it when you try it but the look

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.420 
judge of it when you try it but the look
over<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.200> overall<00:02:53.560> look<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.980> vehicle<00:02:54.370> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
over the overall look of the vehicle is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.910 
over the overall look of the vehicle is
pretty<00:02:54.640> cool<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:56.520> think<00:02:57.520> it's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.910> vehicle<00:02:58.060> that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
pretty cool I think it's a vehicle that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.280 
pretty cool I think it's a vehicle that
drives<00:02:59.920> well<00:03:00.510> lacks<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.720> little<00:03:01.840> bit<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.200> the

suspension<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.660> back<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.440> car<00:03:05.680> hits

everything the car they've they've sped
up<00:05:17.389> the<00:05:17.630> steering<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.139> little<00:05:18.380> bit<00:05:19.060> was<00:05:20.060> a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
up the steering a little bit was a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.850 
up the steering a little bit was a
little<00:05:20.330> slower<00:05:20.630> before<00:05:21.169> they<00:05:21.530> went<00:05:21.680> to

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
little slower before they went to

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.640 
little slower before they went to
basically<00:05:22.840> they've<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:24.289> know<00:05:24.319> slowed

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
basically they've you know slowed

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.950 
basically they've you know slowed
through<00:05:24.889> thirteen<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.370> one<00:05:25.550> or<00:05:26.240> sped<00:05:26.569> it<00:05:26.690> up<00:05:26.780> to

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
through thirteen to one or sped it up to

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.700 
through thirteen to one or sped it up to
13<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.440> one<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:32.080> from<00:05:33.080> a<00:05:33.110> fourteen<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.680> one

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
13 to one the from a fourteen to one

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.939 
13 to one the from a fourteen to one
that<00:05:33.949> they<00:05:34.070> had<00:05:34.219> before<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.530> is<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.680> little

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
that they had before so it is a little

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.379 
that they had before so it is a little
gives<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.699> little<00:05:37.880> bit<00:05:38.000> more<00:05:38.120> nimble

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
gives you a little bit more nimble

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.409 
gives you a little bit more nimble
feeling<00:05:38.990> but<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:39.979> back<00:05:40.219> of<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.490> car<00:05:40.759> has<00:05:41.090> got

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
feeling but the back of the car has got

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.810 
feeling but the back of the car has got
a<00:05:41.449> torsion<00:05:42.139> bar<00:05:42.610> suspension<00:05:43.610> in<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.180> back<00:05:44.419> and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
a torsion bar suspension in the back and

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.279 
a torsion bar suspension in the back and
what<00:05:46.820> that<00:05:46.969> means<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.389> for<00:05:47.599> some<00:05:47.780> crazy<00:05:47.960> reason

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
what that means is for some crazy reason

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.529 
what that means is for some crazy reason
it's<00:05:48.919> puggly<00:05:49.400> when<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:49.759> hit<00:05:49.880> over<00:05:50.000> bumps<00:05:50.389> and

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
it's puggly when you hit over bumps and

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.249 
it's puggly when you hit over bumps and
stuff<00:05:50.599> and<00:05:51.909> that<00:05:52.909> came<00:05:53.150> in<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.330> base<00:05:53.569> model

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
stuff and that came in the base model

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.159 
stuff and that came in the base model
and<00:05:54.789> it's<00:05:55.789> carry<00:05:56.030> over<00:05:56.389> to<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.630> turbo<00:05:56.900> model

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
and it's carry over to the turbo model

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.240 
and it's carry over to the turbo model
and<00:05:57.259> I<00:05:57.289> thought<00:05:57.469> they<00:05:57.680> would<00:05:57.830> have<00:05:57.860> upgraded

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
and I thought they would have upgraded

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.100 
and I thought they would have upgraded
this<00:05:58.639> a<00:05:58.699> little<00:05:58.909> better<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.449> know<00:05:59.569> but<00:05:59.930> I

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
this a little better you know but I

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.589 
this a little better you know but I
guess<00:06:00.380> not<00:06:00.560> other<00:06:01.550> thing<00:06:01.789> is<00:06:01.909> they<00:06:02.090> fix<00:06:02.449> the

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
guess not other thing is they fix the

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.719 
guess not other thing is they fix the
 they<00:06:03.020> fix<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.409> transmissions<00:06:04.069> the

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
 they fix the transmissions the

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.580 
 they fix the transmissions the
original<00:06:05.180> Genesis<00:06:05.659> the<00:06:05.810> first<00:06:05.960> Genesis<00:06:06.440> and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
original Genesis the first Genesis and

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.770 
original Genesis the first Genesis and
stuff<00:06:06.770> really<00:06:07.610> horrible<00:06:08.030> hard<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.389> shifter

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
stuff really horrible hard to shifter

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.779
