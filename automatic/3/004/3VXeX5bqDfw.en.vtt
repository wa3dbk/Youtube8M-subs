00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.749
 I did not have this 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.950
 Such things 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 I can't manage the attack yet 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.359
 Motherboard near kidney transplant headquarters 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
 This was linked to the previous victory 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 After is goal 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
 successive 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.130
 on the other hand 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 Let's get in trouble on the 8th 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.700
 It is the beginning of the cheap 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.080
 There is no effect on the broken hardware at one or two people 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.850
 I finally got it 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 It continued 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.270
 I think of such a wasteful thing as 15:00 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.820
 To stop doing things 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
 This is just finished within 10 days 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.110
 Will say 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.110
 The total amount of traffic for Kashiwa is approximately 20,000 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 So 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.870
 The album went in late November last year 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.130
 Attacker 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 02 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 I can not do that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 Each country should cooperate on average 21 months 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.500
 Using it, such as oem supply 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.270
 Equivalent to Oracle 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 Comprehensive isolation never wins 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 Last knight 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 With it 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730
 the future 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.359
 It became multifunctional 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.359
 First 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.310
 I tightened my mouth 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.430
 We are working hard 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.350
 I think it is a game that answered nothing or bought and boiled to etc 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.320
 There is no problem at all 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.310
 Increase the momentum of the glossy type
