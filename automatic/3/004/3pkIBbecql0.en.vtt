00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.060
 with branches in são paulo and new york its 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.459
 office comprises different 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.180
 segments and absorbs several references 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:15.549
 in their bizarre creations flexibility 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.770
 and temporality that favor the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.530
 integration of environments and practicality 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.450
 I use today the ac 10 is pleased to receive 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.789
 directly here atomic gabriel 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.830
 monteiro da silva she who is an architect and 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.260
 interior and landscape designer 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.420
 stresses saints fine ghetto child 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.000
 to do with you and all of us 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.880
 crisis in the design of this apartment you 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.190
 prioritized circulation and integration 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.890
 total of environments with a little bit 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.140
 This project for us in this project. 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.290
 he I know these customers are the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.710
 my clients so I know them well and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.690
 The intention was really to integrate all 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.640
 environments in this project because now 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 They are with two children at last the truth. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 is the third project in the crisis is the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.350
 third project first new project 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.899
 married the second had a child now 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.389
 family is complete just this 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.490
 So we left a play right away. 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:12.310
 value all other environments that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.329
 the dining table and it is exactly 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.429
 right in the center of the whole leisure area right 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.670
 they do not talk but live together 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.529
 family and around that table people 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.770
 has the living room it comes right? 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:29.079
 there is a multipurpose room aaa the balcony 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.119
 gourmet and this very dining room 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.340
 that there was another main point 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.179
 so the intention was to leave the environment 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.279
 with the children they could run in 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.340
 back from the skateboard table 

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:45.219
 we made use of demolition floors 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.020
 to avoid having a risk problem and the 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.869
 textures by wall texture is 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.719
 Also washable then it is a house for 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.459
 family to receive friends to receive 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.130
 family and for children life 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.319
 their social well is very active and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.929
 they like the house a lot so all the 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.279
 environments are well used right 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.529
 and that was the intention 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.540
 integration of environments and how to 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.490
 meet 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.160
 the balance in the colors prints 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.190
 vibrant furniture they used many 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.980
 pieces of antique furniture as well 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.830
 previous has actually the thigh is them 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.070
 have they have but the references né it is 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.340
 a bahiana he is a star of São Paulo 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.070
 to the limit is the perfect imagination notion 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.040
 perfect then our intention to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.870
 triggering our challenge was to balance 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.300
 these two points, right? 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.860
 a Bahian I'll read the book we 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.230
 can not fail to comment that a 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.810
 great example of balance in colors is 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 wash that draws a lot of attention I think 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.890
 which is a balance of a man 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.410
 really really small but had the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.410
 balance is how we think 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.820
 phenomenal because we made use of 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.470
 wallpaper that took quite a while 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.390
 to find this wallpaper that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 I think it has a vibrant wallpaper 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.190
 with vibrant colors but with very 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 Thin sneakers for that more touch 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.560
 the environment and we ended up 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.860
 punctuation in several diverse pieces in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.410
 for example in the headboard right to 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.930
 We did this in the daytime bathroom too. 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.200
 of the couple who is also an agent scores him 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.110
 It's a bit of a body with more lines. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.930
 tennis but finance such damage an air more 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.640
 exquisite outside toilet that draws a lot 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.940
 attention in this project you have some 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.489
 dispatch a special point 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.040
 of the project is the gourmet kitchen 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.440
 a gourmet grill in which she 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.870
 We opened the porch and integrated the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.090
 steps finally opened the vacancy leaving everything 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.040
 at the same level, the two countries 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.459
 are on the same level same type of floor 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.739
 and that's when my client started 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.180
 then cook we did an environment 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.489
 for him so for the first time a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.160
 only environment of such they enjoy 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.709
 Do you really enjoy this environment? 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.180
 Barbecue has pizza profile has 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.220
 stove then the second kitchen is not open 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.150
 The whole area is very interesting. 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.950
 It was also very cool this project 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.140
