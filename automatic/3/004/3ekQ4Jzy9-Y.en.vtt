about this Andre got a text chips right
in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> cards<00:01:01.440> oh<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> fun<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
in the cards oh this is fun I like this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.299 
in the cards oh this is fun I like this
this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> weren't<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> fact

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this is one if it weren't for the fact

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
this is one if it weren't for the fact
that<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> loose<00:01:05.850> cannon<00:01:06.210> might<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.570> making<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that the loose cannon might be making a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.420 
that the loose cannon might be making a
move<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> could<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.740> easy<00:01:07.860> fold<00:01:08.220> for

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
move this could be an easy fold for

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
move this could be an easy fold for
Daniel<00:01:08.729> he's<00:01:08.909> behind<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.420> even<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.869> King<00:01:10.200> he

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Daniel he's behind two even one King he

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
Daniel he's behind two even one King he
could<00:01:10.619> easily<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> best<00:01:11.670> hand<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
could easily not have the best hand and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.399 
could easily not have the best hand and
it's<00:01:12.270> possible<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.810> doesn't<00:01:13.049> even<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's possible he doesn't even have the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
it's possible he doesn't even have the
best<00:01:13.619> draw<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.880> he's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> dog<00:01:15.360> right

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
best draw you can see he's a dog right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.300 
best draw you can see he's a dog right
now

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.230 

so<00:01:21.310> we've<00:01:21.580> got<00:01:21.790> 69<00:01:22.680> 79<00:01:23.880> Daniels<00:01:24.880> doing<00:01:25.090> some

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
so we've got 69 79 Daniels doing some

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.640 
so we've got 69 79 Daniels doing some
calculations<00:01:25.450> now<00:01:25.960> he's<00:01:26.110> actually<00:01:26.320> not

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
calculations now he's actually not

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.260 
calculations now he's actually not
