00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.010
 tha 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello haifa garage manager 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.559
 I will teach you how to change 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 an alternator for that we're going 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.010
 take some tools to be able to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.150
 disassemble the alternator first step 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.140
 as we will intervene in a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 electrical circuit 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.590
 we are going to unplug the battery for 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.100
 always be starting with 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.030
 gills the bollard - always first 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.969
 we are going to unplug the terminal more than 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.620
 we will remove 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.850
 we can work safely once 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.039
 the battery disconnected we will 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 disconnect the terminals at 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.559
 the alternator for that we have 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 need to unplug a terminal the terminal 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.960
 feeding more here we disassemble on 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 put back the bolt to not lose it 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.589
 then we branches have the small 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.079
 plug once power supply 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.089
 electric removed we will proceed 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 to the clamps of the installer we 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.470
 let's go loosen the alternator for 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.150
 to be able to take away power 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.770
 fasteners only we do not remove 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.940
 the jobs just on dessert have made the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.759
 alternator tower so-called 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.189
 the turn it is necessary that the alternator moves 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.020
 we do it we could vote in the front towards 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.380
 the direction of the motor to remove the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.180
 alternator belt once 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 the alternator disassemble we're going 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 proceed with the assembly of a new 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.539
 alternator we will do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.079
 the operation in reverse 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:36.560
 we will put the main focus the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.560
 court to other amateurs 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.430
 here's the yard is past we're going 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.000
 put the screw back on a little bit 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.460
 the alternator we promise the establishment 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 and proceeds seriously once the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.200
 alternator place and services and we 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.510
 let's proceed to put the beam back 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 power supply of 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.920
 the alternator that you hand over that you 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.260
 squeeze and another diet that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060
 you just have to clip it does not stay 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.020
 more than reassemble the battery 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.910
 start with the good one 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.740
 then the band - that's it today 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.120
 you have seen how proceeds for offered 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.290
 replacement of an alternator 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.490
 if you want to know more you 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.390
 can watch the video how 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.390
 maintain your body
