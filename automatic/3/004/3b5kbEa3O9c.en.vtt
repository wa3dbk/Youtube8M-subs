00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.910 

all<00:00:07.270> right<00:00:07.390> I<00:00:07.450> was<00:00:07.569> doing<00:00:07.779> some<00:00:07.990> load<00:00:08.440> testing

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
all right I was doing some load testing

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
all right I was doing some load testing
with<00:00:09.400> some<00:00:09.879> Sierra<00:00:10.270> bullets<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.500> bargain<00:00:12.129> and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
with some Sierra bullets and bargain and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.150 
with some Sierra bullets and bargain and
we're<00:00:13.840> running<00:00:14.110> back<00:00:14.379> and<00:00:14.529> forth<00:00:14.619> out<00:00:14.949> to<00:00:15.129> a

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
we're running back and forth out to a

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.010 
we're running back and forth out to a
little<00:00:15.430> bit<00:00:15.520> under<00:00:15.670> 300<00:00:16.059> yards<00:00:16.330> about<00:00:16.539> 285

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
little bit under 300 yards about 285

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.210 
little bit under 300 yards about 285
yards<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.300> is<00:00:19.480> what<00:00:20.439> I<00:00:20.470> had<00:00:20.800> so<00:00:21.160> it

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
yards and this is what I had so it

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.530 
yards and this is what I had so it
wasn't<00:00:21.490> didn't<00:00:21.910> turn<00:00:22.000> out<00:00:22.120> to<00:00:22.180> be<00:00:22.210> much<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.420> a

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
wasn't didn't turn out to be much of a

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.790 
wasn't didn't turn out to be much of a
ladder<00:00:22.750> test<00:00:23.080> they<00:00:23.230> were<00:00:23.320> then<00:00:23.440> clustered

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
ladder test they were then clustered

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.950 
ladder test they were then clustered
pretty<00:00:24.040> good<00:00:24.190> together<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.630> getting<00:00:25.840> pretty

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
pretty good together it's getting pretty

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.380 
pretty good together it's getting pretty
dark<00:00:26.080> out<00:00:26.440> there<00:00:26.470> but<00:00:26.920> I<00:00:27.160> mean<00:00:27.760> from<00:00:27.970> top<00:00:28.360> to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
dark out there but I mean from top to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.540 
dark out there but I mean from top to
bottom<00:00:28.539> if<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.590> take<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.890> shot<00:00:30.100> number<00:00:30.310> one

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
bottom if you take a shot number one

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.130 
bottom if you take a shot number one
vertically<00:00:31.000> that's<00:00:31.330> probably<00:00:31.660> all<00:00:31.840> within

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
vertically that's probably all within

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.590 
vertically that's probably all within
about<00:00:32.259> three<00:00:32.619> inches<00:00:32.920> of<00:00:33.910> each<00:00:34.059> other<00:00:34.390> these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
about three inches of each other these

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.970 
about three inches of each other these
two<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.989> are<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.260> sides<00:00:35.500> or<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.770> last

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
two that are on the sides or the last

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.229 
two that are on the sides or the last
two<00:00:36.129> that<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.370> shot<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.789> intentionally

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
two that I shot and I intentionally

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.669 
two that I shot and I intentionally
pulled<00:00:37.449> them<00:00:37.600> off<00:00:37.690> left<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.050> right<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.469> I<00:00:38.530> can

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
pulled them off left and right so I can

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.559 
pulled them off left and right so I can
fire<00:00:38.859> two<00:00:39.100> rounds<00:00:39.399> we're<00:00:39.609> going<00:00:39.850> down<00:00:39.999> to<00:00:40.149> down

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.569 
fire two rounds we're going down to down

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.559 
fire two rounds we're going down to down
the<00:00:40.870> range<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.469> mark<00:00:41.679> them<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.329> look<00:00:43.449> in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
the range to mark them if you look in

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.469 
the range to mark them if you look in
the<00:00:43.659> center<00:00:43.809> here<00:00:44.460> they're<00:00:45.460> misnumbered<00:00:46.059> but

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
the center here they're misnumbered but

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.549 
the center here they're misnumbered but
six<00:00:46.929> seven<00:00:48.390> eight<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.569> nine<00:00:49.659> are<00:00:50.170> these<00:00:50.350> four

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
six seven eight and nine are these four

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.189 
six seven eight and nine are these four
shots<00:00:50.829> here<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.629> they're<00:00:52.629> all<00:00:52.749> pretty<00:00:52.960> close

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
shots here and they're all pretty close

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.910 
shots here and they're all pretty close
vertically<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:57.010> was<00:00:57.159> forty<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:59.409> forty

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
vertically and that was forty to forty

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.369 
vertically and that was forty to forty
point<00:01:00.129> nine<00:01:00.370> grains<00:01:00.760> as<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.960> range<00:01:02.139> of<00:01:02.289> those

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
point nine grains as the range of those

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.820 
point nine grains as the range of those
four<00:01:02.649> shots<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:04.629> if<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.320> look<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
four shots and then if you look at the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.670 
four shots and then if you look at the
higher<00:01:06.010> end<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.549> if<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.729> look<00:01:06.909> at<00:01:07.260> 14<00:01:08.260> 15

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
higher end of it if you look at 14 15

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.520 
higher end of it if you look at 14 15
and<00:01:08.710> 16<00:01:09.450> there's<00:01:10.450> fourteen<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.229> then<00:01:11.350> there's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
and 16 there's fourteen and then there's

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.380 
and 16 there's fourteen and then there's
15<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.039> 16<00:01:12.399> again<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:12.700> pulled<00:01:13.000> them<00:01:13.090> left<00:01:13.240> and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
15 and 16 again I pulled them left and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.569 
15 and 16 again I pulled them left and
right<00:01:13.509> on<00:01:13.659> purpose<00:01:14.100> those<00:01:15.100> are<00:01:15.280> all<00:01:15.369> pretty

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
right on purpose those are all pretty

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.830 
right on purpose those are all pretty
much<00:01:15.759> in<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.000> straight<00:01:16.030> line<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.539> each<00:01:16.659> other

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
much in a straight line with each other

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.849 
much in a straight line with each other
also<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.490> those<00:01:18.640> are<00:01:18.789> about<00:01:19.409> forty<00:01:20.409> two<00:01:20.590> point

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
also so those are about forty two point

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.069 
also so those are about forty two point
four<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.369> forty<00:01:21.700> three<00:01:21.850> grains<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.899> argot<00:01:23.320> so

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
four to forty three grains of argot so

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.539 
four to forty three grains of argot so
what<00:01:26.079> I<00:01:26.109> did<00:01:26.350> was<00:01:26.469> I<00:01:26.500> picked<00:01:26.770> an<00:01:27.009> amount<00:01:27.430> that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
what I did was I picked an amount that

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.249 
what I did was I picked an amount that
was<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.820> middle<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.299> those<00:01:28.450> two<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.930> loaded

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
was in the middle of those two I loaded

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.249 
was in the middle of those two I loaded
up<00:01:29.460> nine<00:01:30.460> rounds<00:01:30.640> each<00:01:32.399> nine<00:01:33.399> rounds<00:01:33.609> of<00:01:34.259> forty

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
up nine rounds each nine rounds of forty

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.770 
up nine rounds each nine rounds of forty
point<00:01:35.469> five<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.950> nine<00:01:36.130> rounds<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.640> 42.6<00:01:42.780> fire

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
point five and nine rounds of 42.6 fire

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.940 
point five and nine rounds of 42.6 fire
a<00:01:43.810> few<00:01:43.990> rounds<00:01:44.079> at<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.469> time<00:01:44.679> there<00:01:44.829> was

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
a few rounds at a time there was

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.139 
a few rounds at a time there was
somebody<00:01:45.100> else<00:01:45.280> there<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.759> he<00:01:45.820> seemed<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.090> be

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
somebody else there and he seemed to be

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.149 
somebody else there and he seemed to be
able<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.329> time<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.750> Hill<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.859> pull<00:01:48.039> this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
able to time it to Hill to pull this

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.340 
able to time it to Hill to pull this
trigger<00:01:48.429> right<00:01:48.549> before<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.909> did<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.659> know<00:01:50.140> in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
trigger right before I did so I know in

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.899 
trigger right before I did so I know in
two<00:01:50.499> of<00:01:50.590> these<00:01:50.679> three<00:01:50.920> did<00:01:51.249> this<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.729> these

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
two of these three did this and these

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.849 
two of these three did this and these
are<00:01:52.270> not<00:01:52.539> near<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:52.929> tight<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.499> thought<00:01:53.649> they

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
are not near as tight as I thought they

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.340 
are not near as tight as I thought they
would<00:01:53.890> be<00:01:54.359> all<00:01:55.359> right<00:01:55.479> that's<00:01:55.749> the<00:01:55.899> first<00:01:56.170> one

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
would be all right that's the first one

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.779 
would be all right that's the first one
that<00:01:56.439> I<00:01:56.560> did<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.840> lighter<00:01:59.020> load<00:01:59.789> and

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
that I did with the lighter load and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.459 
that I did with the lighter load and
this<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.329> first<00:02:01.569> one<00:02:01.719> that<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:01.990> did<00:02:02.229> with

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
this is the first one that I did with

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.370 
this is the first one that I did with
the<00:02:03.039> heavier<00:02:03.310> load<00:02:03.490> forty<00:02:03.789> two<00:02:03.909> point<00:02:04.119> six<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the heavier load forty two point six so

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.919 
the heavier load forty two point six so
these<00:02:05.530> were<00:02:05.710> pretty<00:02:06.039> tight<00:02:06.280> together<00:02:06.659> well<00:02:07.659> I

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
these were pretty tight together well I

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.820 
these were pretty tight together well I
pulled<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.440> off<00:02:08.500> or<00:02:08.770> not

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
pulled that one off or not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.620 
pulled that one off or not
and<00:02:10.400> back<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.700> lighter<00:02:10.880> load<00:02:11.090> again<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.570> I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
and back to lighter load again and I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.440 
and back to lighter load again and I
stood<00:02:11.840> again<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.850> little<00:02:14.000> over<00:02:14.330> an

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
stood again this is a little over an

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.960 
stood again this is a little over an
inch<00:02:14.570> spread<00:02:15.380> here<00:02:15.590> which<00:02:15.860> isn't<00:02:16.070> bad<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:16.700> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
inch spread here which isn't bad but I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.210 
inch spread here which isn't bad but I
really<00:02:17.600> thought<00:02:17.810> after<00:02:18.350> having<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:19.100> know

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
really thought after having you know

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.530 
really thought after having you know
this<00:02:19.370> three-inch<00:02:19.730> spreaded<00:02:20.180> these<00:02:20.300> shots

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
this three-inch spreaded these shots

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.640 
this three-inch spreaded these shots
would<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.780> pretty<00:02:21.050> much<00:02:21.110> right<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.440> top<00:02:21.620> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
would be pretty much right on top of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.060 
would be pretty much right on top of
each<00:02:21.860> other<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.780> shot<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.650> one<00:02:24.860> over

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
each other so then I shot this one over

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.460 
each other so then I shot this one over
here<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.390> had<00:02:26.540> two<00:02:26.690> shots<00:02:26.900> around<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.290> top

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
here and I had two shots around on top

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.720 
here and I had two shots around on top
of<00:02:27.620> each<00:02:27.710> other<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.220> getting<00:02:28.490> ready<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
of each other and I was getting ready to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.570 
of each other and I was getting ready to
do<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.180> third<00:02:29.420> shot<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.900> again<00:02:30.340> he<00:02:31.340> shot

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
do this third shot and again he shot

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.190 
do this third shot and again he shot
just<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.000> pulled<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.300> trigger<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.990> if<00:02:33.110> you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
just as I pulled the trigger but if you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.930 
just as I pulled the trigger but if you
look<00:02:33.410> at<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.220> markings<00:02:34.610> here<00:02:34.730> these

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
look at the markings here these

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.880 
look at the markings here these
center-to-center<00:02:35.690> are<00:02:36.230> less<00:02:36.470> than<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.710> inch

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
center-to-center are less than an inch

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.740 
center-to-center are less than an inch
even<00:02:37.880> though<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.000> pulled<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.600> off

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
even though I pulled this one off

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.150 
even though I pulled this one off
because<00:02:39.680> he<00:02:39.890> shot<00:02:40.100> right<00:02:40.160> before<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.580> did<00:02:42.160> and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
because he shot right before I did and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.420 
because he shot right before I did and
this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.510> last<00:02:44.750> group<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.590> shot<00:02:45.860> of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
this is the last group that I shot of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.910 
this is the last group that I shot of
lighter<00:02:46.760> load<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.230> see<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.560> about

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
lighter load and you can see it's about

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.370 
lighter load and you can see it's about
an<00:02:49.100> inch<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> quarter<00:02:49.580> spread<00:02:50.380> between

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
an inch and a quarter spread between

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.370 
an inch and a quarter spread between
these<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.440> heavier<00:02:54.440> load<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:55.700> my<00:02:55.880> last

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
these and heavier load that's my last

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.480 
these and heavier load that's my last
one<00:02:57.380> with<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> heavier<00:02:57.830> load<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.310> that's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
one with a heavier load so that's

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.000 
one with a heavier load so that's
probably<00:02:58.990> half<00:02:59.990> an<00:03:00.140> introduced<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.650> here<00:03:00.830> more

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
probably half an introduced to here more

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.860 
probably half an introduced to here more
than<00:03:01.160> enough<00:03:01.820> whenever<00:03:02.210> so<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.450> seems<00:03:02.660> like

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
than enough whenever so it seems like

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.940 
than enough whenever so it seems like
that<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:04.160> gun<00:03:04.340> likes<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:06.080> heavier

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
that the the gun likes the the heavier

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.120 
that the the gun likes the the heavier
load<00:03:07.160> that's<00:03:07.460> forty<00:03:08.030> two<00:03:08.150> point<00:03:08.420> six<00:03:09.130> grains

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
load that's forty two point six grains
