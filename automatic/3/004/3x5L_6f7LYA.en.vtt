notch<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.600> think<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> play-calling<00:02:45.770> was<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> lot

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
notch I think the play-calling was a lot

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.920 
notch I think the play-calling was a lot
better<00:02:46.340> i<00:02:46.520> think<00:02:46.820> we<00:02:47.030> were<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.240> position<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.780> lot

better i think we were in position a lot

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
better i think we were in position a lot
better<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.470> i<00:02:49.040> think<00:02:49.280> we<00:02:49.520> went<00:02:49.670> against<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
