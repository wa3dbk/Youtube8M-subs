00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.519
 London still has a video today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 is about 12.1 on the nexus 5 and indeed 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 let's start to say to anticipate 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 I would like an android app future that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.420
 I show again a brand new one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.800
 topic down so if you have it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 once we open here we have the normal 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 surface of 5.1 so we can 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.489
 now here so always up and up 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.780
 Although we have over once 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 layout while layout armani on the side of the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 click on vertical enemies on it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 we have the android app future say 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.899
 me now we can also through 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 scroll what we want to have is completely 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 made cool whoever likes it can be 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 I can not activate it now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.070
 so a fan of so excited again 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.270
 yes that 's the version of yesterday 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 and she runs very well as well for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.670
 Envy was how you actually know there 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.350
 should not be too much to say that very 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 well I have themes here right now 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 That's why the whole thing is installed 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.750
 yes, a bit darker, but it does 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.030
 works very well so wlan too 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 further away is no problem for that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 nexus where he actually wlan 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.670
 -receiving now advise not very high 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.409
 this is really true with the nexus 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.420
 well yes we have the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 So you have to adjust sasion ott 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.240
 now here with designs the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.119
 screen lock and continue down 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 we the user settings 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's still tough for the camera like that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.899
 and you have here user system 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.549
 profile what actually knows 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.360
 provide status bar notification 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.729
 For example , you can also change the clock 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.479
 I have the percentages here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.549
 also once and yes off sound button 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.979
 we have to restart here we do 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.110
 just that is very much possible 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.350
 afloat is also very stable the only one 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.670
 what you want 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.580
 max has what I found out so far 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.540
 that was the speaker down here 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.710
 now and then spins and yes suddenly the same 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.900
 more of her see again the 'good 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:31.660
 animation by jowood 12.1 or 12 so 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.820
 the new number two in the speaker 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.960
 back and listening to music and with the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.910
 rewind original music player like that 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.980
 two times I think then falls 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 the loudspeaker also out of this can 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.920
 you only fix it after rebooting 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.890
 pity but well with google music or 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.600
 is back that's fine and so 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.360
 while also taking care of the lockscreen like 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.000
 which also undertook the original ian can 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.580
 we put you in the camera that's no 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 The problem is also very good and the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.780
 Video mode, of course, also runs here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.220
 go very well again the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 Settings for normal fast 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.440
 attitudes and have to go here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.960
 Let's just state the status bar 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.490
 can pull that down here once 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960
 I open it faster 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.490
 set to right can shut down 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.160
 pull and it opens in the bar 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.250
 I already know everything from stents 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.980
 10 11 our krams yes and then about 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.720
 devices android 50 1.1 the lollipop 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.570
 Variation that was clear 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.600
 and not so much say yes say 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.340
 easily contaminated my video and yes 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.240
 if you liked it you give one 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.610
 thumbs up 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.860
 I would be happy about comments 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.940
