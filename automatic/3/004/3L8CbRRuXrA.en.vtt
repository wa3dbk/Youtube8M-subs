that you want to collect health here's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.560 
that you want to collect health here's
our<00:00:10.830> health<00:00:11.010> box<00:00:11.309> let's<00:00:11.940> see<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.179> enemy<00:00:12.330> he's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
our health box let's see you enemy he's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.919 
our health box let's see you enemy he's
caged<00:00:12.870> up<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:13.549> and<00:00:14.549> not<00:00:15.330> getting<00:00:15.630> over<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
caged up for now and not getting over a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.150 
caged up for now and not getting over a
hundred<00:00:16.199> percent<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> hundred

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
hundred percent so you have a hundred

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.090 
hundred percent so you have a hundred
percent<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.640> health<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.199> know<00:00:19.740> not

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
percent of health how do you know not

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
percent of health how do you know not
explode<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> into<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> thousand

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
explode that into like a thousand

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
explode that into like a thousand
percent<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> health<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.949> I've<00:00:23.010> done<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.340> it's

percent of health well I've done it it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.240 
percent of health well I've done it it's
pretty<00:00:23.699> simple<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.470> developing<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:26.099> our

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
pretty simple I'm developing for our

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
pretty simple I'm developing for our
next<00:00:26.460> part<00:00:26.760> which<00:00:27.060> will<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.420> dealing<00:00:27.570> with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
next part which will be dealing with

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660 
next part which will be dealing with
multiple<00:00:28.140> parts<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.980> might<00:00:29.130> also<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.519> dealing

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
multiple parts I might also be dealing

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
multiple parts I might also be dealing
with<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:30.210> advanced<00:00:30.599> health<00:00:30.929> system<00:00:31.489> but

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
with an advanced health system but

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.240 
with an advanced health system but
that's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.820> lot<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.380> dragon<00:00:34.380> job<00:00:34.620> stuff<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that's a lot of dragon job stuff and I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
that's a lot of dragon job stuff and I
want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> keep<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> simple<00:00:35.940> right<00:00:36.270> now

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
want to keep it simple right now

want to keep it simple right now
it's<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.670> our<00:00:38.879> health<00:00:39.120> box<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.840> collision

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it's on so our health box on collision

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's on so our health box on collision
with<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.559> player<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.420> then<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
with our player and then you want to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
with our player and then you want to
click<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:44.010> add<00:00:44.280> another<00:00:44.610> condition<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
click right add another condition and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
click right add another condition and
the<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.629> condition<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:48.079> it's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.520> global

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the other condition is it's a global

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.020 
the other condition is it's a global
variable<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> system<00:00:51.989> variable<00:00:53.030> compare

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
variable or a system variable compare

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389

variable compare a variable health less
than<00:00:56.610> 100<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:58.020> only<00:00:58.260> pick<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.620> health

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
than 100 so you can only pick up health

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
than 100 so you can only pick up health
if<00:00:59.309> you're<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:02.670> health<00:01:03.300> is

and<00:02:09.250> boom<00:02:09.610> our<00:02:10.030> health<00:02:10.239> is<00:02:10.390> out<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.599> thousand

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
and boom our health is out of thousand

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.860 
and boom our health is out of thousand
but<00:02:11.739> we<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:12.040> need<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:13.269> most<00:02:13.660> likely

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
but we don't need that it most likely

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
to do is take Li take this health box

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.330 
to do is take Li take this health box
and<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.579> have<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.060> calculate<00:04:22.800> I'd<00:04:23.800> say<00:04:24.130> a

and then you have to calculate I'd say a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.450 
and then you have to calculate I'd say a
good<00:04:24.700> six<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.419> eight<00:04:25.810> variables<00:04:26.380> saying<00:04:27.160> if

good six to eight variables saying if

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.610 
good six to eight variables saying if
player<00:04:27.910> helped<00:04:28.270> us<00:04:28.419> lessen<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.050> if<00:04:29.470> it's

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
player helped us lessen this if it's

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.150 
player helped us lessen this if it's
that<00:04:29.860> if<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:31.560> if<00:04:32.560> it's<00:04:32.740> less<00:04:32.919> than<00:04:33.070> a
