canada<00:00:22.890> stream<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.609> i<00:00:24.180> started

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
canada stream right as i started

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.939 
canada stream right as i started
attacking<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> base<00:00:25.769> we're

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
attacking but this is the base we're

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.130 
attacking but this is the base we're
gonna<00:00:26.039> hit<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> number<00:00:26.849> seven<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.810> map

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
gonna hit it is number seven on the map

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
gonna hit it is number seven on the map
so<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:28.980> i<00:00:29.220> mean<00:00:29.460> i<00:00:29.550> guess<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:29.880> scouting<00:00:30.090> out

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so I'm i mean i guess we're scouting out

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.150 
so I'm i mean i guess we're scouting out
right<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> attack<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
right now and we are going to attack it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
right now and we are going to attack it
because<00:00:32.430> my<00:00:32.579> army<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.940> already<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.290> doesn't

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
because my army is already it doesn't

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
because my army is already it doesn't
look<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.739> too<00:00:34.770> difficult<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> base<00:00:35.880> i'm

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
look like too difficult of a base i'm

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.630 
look like too difficult of a base i'm
thinking<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> from<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> top<00:00:37.640> i'm

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
thinking of going from the top i'm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.130 
thinking of going from the top i'm
cleaning<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> bottom<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> travel

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
cleaning the bottom is kind of a travel

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.270 
cleaning the bottom is kind of a travel
looks<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> bombs<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
looks like there's a lot of bombs and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.819 
looks like there's a lot of bombs and
Tesla's<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.379> I'm<00:00:43.379> worried<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Tesla's down there and I'm worried that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
Tesla's down there and I'm worried that
my<00:00:44.040> Wizards<00:00:44.550> which<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.969> crucial<00:00:45.539> key<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> my

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
my Wizards which are crucial key of my

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
my Wizards which are crucial key of my
army<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> die<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.090> through

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
army are going to die if we go through

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.790 
army are going to die if we go through
the<00:00:48.420> bottom<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> top<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> doesn't<00:00:49.680> seem

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the bottom but the top it doesn't seem

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.020 
the bottom but the top it doesn't seem
like<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> bombs

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
like there's going to be a lot of bombs

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
like there's going to be a lot of bombs
or<00:00:51.239> anything<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.690> checked<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.739> my

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
or anything actually checked with my

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
or anything actually checked with my
bearings<00:00:53.399> before<00:00:53.489> deploying<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.090> golems<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
bearings before deploying my golems and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.220 
bearings before deploying my golems and
it<00:00:55.500> looks<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:55.949> no<00:00:56.010> traps<00:00:56.399> either<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
it's not going to be that difficult

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's not going to be that difficult
these<00:01:17.280> balloons<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.509> pretty<00:01:18.840> easy<00:01:19.110> to

the Wizards and queen army they're

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
the Wizards and queen army they're
already<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> center<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
already down we are in the center and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
already down we are in the center and
the<00:01:24.360> king<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.780> jumped<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> wall<00:01:25.470> some

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the king just jumped over the wall some

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.710 
the king just jumped over the wall some
skeleton<00:01:26.580> traps<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> bombs

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
skeleton traps and there go the bombs

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
skeleton traps and there go the bombs
and<00:01:27.960> Tesla<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.159> took<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and Tesla so as you see we took the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
and Tesla so as you see we took the
safest<00:01:29.939> route<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> quite<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> best

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
safest route and this is quite the best

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
safest route and this is quite the best
option<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> guess<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.299> thirty-four

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
option I guess out of also thirty-four

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.550 
option I guess out of also thirty-four
percent<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> far<00:01:34.860> king<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> Queen

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
percent so far king is down in the Queen

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
percent so far king is down in the Queen
I<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:39.060> ticked<00:01:39.479> off<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:39.900> her<00:01:40.020> she<00:01:40.229> went

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
I was really ticked off at her she went

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.980 
I was really ticked off at her she went
towards<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> top<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> she<00:01:41.189> totally<00:01:41.990> sabotage

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
towards the top and she totally sabotage

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
towards the top and she totally sabotage
my<00:01:43.200> entire<00:01:43.500> raid<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> again

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
my entire raid and so we're it's again

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.289 
my entire raid and so we're it's again
forty<00:01:45.299> five<00:01:45.450> percent<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> queen<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.790> up

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
forty five percent and the queen is up

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.330 
forty five percent and the queen is up
there<00:01:48.540> she's<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> probably<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there she's going to probably get to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
there she's going to probably get to
fifty<00:01:50.670> percent<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> she<00:01:51.299> does<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.710> fifty

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
fifty percent and she does so at fifty

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.190 
fifty percent and she does so at fifty
two<00:01:53.100> percent<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> Town<00:01:54.090> Hall<00:01:54.119> does<00:01:55.020> not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
two percent but the Town Hall does not

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.370 
two percent but the Town Hall does not
go<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.890> got<00:01:56.130> no<00:01:56.430> health<00:01:56.670> left<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.380> well

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
go down it's got no health left and well

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
go down it's got no health left and well
basically<00:01:58.530> no<00:01:58.890> health<00:01:59.130> deploying<00:01:59.969> some

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
basically no health deploying some

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
basically no health deploying some
archers<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.810> looks<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.380> no<00:02:01.649> way

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
archers and it looks like there's no way

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.560 
archers and it looks like there's no way
to<00:02:02.280> target<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> town<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.270> starting<00:02:03.360> in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to target the town how it's starting in

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.789 
to target the town how it's starting in
the<00:02:03.630> clan<00:02:03.840> castle<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.380> something<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the clan castle or something at the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.160 
the clan castle or something at the
bottom<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.729> deployed<00:02:06.210> my<00:02:06.270> clan<00:02:06.600> castle<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
bottom so I deployed my clan castle the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
bottom so I deployed my clan castle the
final<00:02:07.530> line<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> bunch<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.670> archers

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
final line there have a bunch of archers

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.809 
final line there have a bunch of archers
and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:10.890> five<00:02:11.250> wizards<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and I think I still have five wizards in

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.740 
and I think I still have five wizards in
there<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.720> archers<00:02:13.020> sort<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
there and the archers sort of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.770 
there and the archers sort of
tie<00:02:14.050> off<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.590> mortar<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.640> inferno<00:02:16.420> right

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
tie off to the mortar and inferno right

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.290 
tie off to the mortar and inferno right
away<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.470> Wizards<00:02:17.680> luckily<00:02:18.550> they<00:02:19.060> go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
away but the Wizards luckily they go

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.230 
away but the Wizards luckily they go
around<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:20.220> jump<00:02:21.220> expires<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> all

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
around that jump expires to the all

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.000 
around that jump expires to the all
target<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> town<00:02:22.870> home<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.380> before<00:02:23.500> they

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
target the town home just before they

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.920 
target the town home just before they
get<00:02:24.130> hit<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.520> mauled<00:02:24.850> by<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.030> mortar<00:02:25.480> they

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
get hit and mauled by that mortar they

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.470 
get hit and mauled by that mortar they
pick<00:02:26.350> up<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.740> second<00:02:27.250> star<00:02:27.490> guys<00:02:27.970> that's<00:02:28.270> got

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
pick up that second star guys that's got

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.180 
pick up that second star guys that's got
to<00:02:28.600> be<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> closest<00:02:29.500> attacks<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.070> this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
to be one of the closest attacks in this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.360 
to be one of the closest attacks in this
war<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:30.700> far<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.270> i<00:02:32.110> gotta<00:02:32.290> say<00:02:32.560> i<00:02:32.590> did<00:02:33.250> not

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
war so far and i gotta say i did not

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.130

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
thing i did bad i guess is first i

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.509 
thing i did bad i guess is first i
didn't<00:03:53.290> deploy<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.680> wall<00:03:53.860> breakers<00:03:54.250> fast

didn't deploy the wall breakers fast

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.860 
didn't deploy the wall breakers fast
enough<00:03:54.820> they<00:03:54.940> should<00:03:55.180> have<00:03:55.299> been<00:03:55.420> out<00:03:55.600> by<00:03:55.840> now

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
enough they should have been out by now

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.440 
enough they should have been out by now
and<00:03:56.440> they're<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.760> getting<00:03:57.910> deployed<00:03:58.239> now

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.910 
and they're just getting deployed now
but<00:03:58.720> i<00:03:58.750> guess<00:03:59.049> i<00:03:59.230> took<00:03:59.470> care<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.709> those

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
but i guess i took care of those

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.340 
but i guess i took care of those
balloons<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:01.060> they're<00:04:01.600> going<00:04:01.810> down<00:04:01.989> at<00:04:02.170> least

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350
