it's an emergency drinking water system

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.560 
it's an emergency drinking water system
it's<00:00:19.419> basically<00:00:20.160> using<00:00:21.160> distillation<00:00:21.699> to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
it's basically using distillation to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.960 
it's basically using distillation to
purify<00:00:22.960> your<00:00:23.109> water<00:00:23.289> so<00:00:23.710> we've<00:00:24.279> talked<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:24.910> lot

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
purify your water so we've talked a lot

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.419 
purify your water so we've talked a lot
about<00:00:25.119> filters<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.930> things<00:00:26.080> but<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.220> a

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
about filters and things but this is a

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.080 
about filters and things but this is a
another<00:00:28.210> cool<00:00:28.539> way<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:28.990> I'm<00:00:29.410> gonna<00:00:29.500> use

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
another cool way and I'm gonna use

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.490 
another cool way and I'm gonna use
instead<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.150> using<00:00:31.240> my<00:00:31.630> stove<00:00:31.929> again<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.290> want

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
instead of using my stove again I want

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.540 
instead of using my stove again I want
to<00:00:32.529> be<00:00:32.590> able<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.769> do<00:00:32.860> this<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.190> grid<00:00:33.370> down

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
to be able to do this in a grid down

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.939 
to be able to do this in a grid down
situation<00:00:33.820> I'm<00:00:34.480> gonna<00:00:34.600> use<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> stove<00:00:35.739> tech

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
situation I'm gonna use a stove tech

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.720 
situation I'm gonna use a stove tech
rocket<00:00:36.339> stove<00:00:36.580> here<00:00:36.910> today<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:38.550> distill<00:00:39.550> off

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
rocket stove here today to distill off

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.150 
rocket stove here today to distill off
some<00:00:39.940> water<00:00:40.180> so<00:00:40.540> just<00:00:40.780> just<00:00:41.649> open<00:00:41.980> this<00:00:42.100> thing

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
some water so just just open this thing

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.000 
some water so just just open this thing
up<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.789> comes<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:44.670> comes<00:00:45.670> with<00:00:45.850> two<00:00:46.000> pots

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
up that comes with a comes with two pots

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.979 
up that comes with a comes with two pots
comes<00:00:48.010> with<00:00:48.219> a<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.760> middle<00:00:49.329> thing<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.809> comes

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
comes with a the middle thing that comes

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.900 
comes with a the middle thing that comes
with<00:00:50.170> two<00:00:50.469> different<00:00:50.500> diet<00:00:50.949> science<00:00:51.520> diameter

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
with two different diet science diameter

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.299 
with two different diet science diameter
pots<00:00:52.180> here<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:52.899> we<00:00:52.989> got<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.170> smaller<00:00:53.860> pot<00:00:54.160> that

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
pots here so we got a smaller pot that

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.799 
pots here so we got a smaller pot that
we're<00:00:54.430> gonna<00:00:54.520> fill<00:00:54.820> up<00:00:54.969> with<00:00:55.149> our<00:00:55.300> dirty<00:00:55.539> water

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
we're gonna fill up with our dirty water

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.599 
we're gonna fill up with our dirty water
and<00:00:56.020> I<00:00:56.050> think<00:00:56.289> today<00:00:56.500> we're<00:00:56.649> gonna<00:00:56.739> choose

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
and I think today we're gonna choose

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.520 
and I think today we're gonna choose
some<00:00:57.850> high<00:00:58.000> quality<00:00:58.059> pond<00:00:58.719> water<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.350> cows

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
some high quality pond water the cows

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.619 
some high quality pond water the cows
have<00:00:59.739> been<00:00:59.770> drinking<00:01:00.129> out<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.579> then<00:01:01.449> we've

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
have been drinking out and then we've

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.490 
have been drinking out and then we've
got<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.440> actual<00:01:02.800> distiller<00:01:03.370> part<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.239> then<00:01:05.199> a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
got the actual distiller part and then a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.920 
got the actual distiller part and then a
pot<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.100> top<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.640> causes<00:01:07.149> that<00:01:07.300> we<00:01:07.450> put<00:01:07.690> cold

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
pot on top that causes that we put cold

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.190 
pot on top that causes that we put cold
water<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.289> and<00:01:08.679> that<00:01:09.490> causes<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.209> the<00:01:11.020> bad

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
water in and that causes the the bad

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.389 
water in and that causes the the bad
water<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.759> condensate<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.780> condense

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
water to condensate to condense

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.850 
water to condensate to condense
condensate<00:01:15.399> to<00:01:15.729> condense<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:16.539> now<00:01:17.470> for<00:01:17.740> that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
condensate to condense and now for that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.109 
condensate to condense and now for that
we're<00:01:18.069> going<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.220> collect<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> water<00:01:18.819> in<00:01:19.000> this

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
we're going to collect the water in this

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.550 
we're going to collect the water in this
Pyrex<00:01:20.110> measuring<00:01:21.240> container<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.080> hope<00:01:23.500> that

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
Pyrex measuring container so I hope that

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.960 
Pyrex measuring container so I hope that
makes<00:01:23.830> sense<00:01:24.099> let's<00:01:24.340> go<00:01:24.490> get<00:01:24.640> some<00:01:24.789> nasty

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
makes sense let's go get some nasty

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.760 
makes sense let's go get some nasty
water<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.599> distill<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.289> then<00:01:26.530> we're<00:01:26.649> gonna

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
water to distill and then we're gonna

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.419 
water to distill and then we're gonna
drink<00:01:27.069> it

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
drink it

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.050 
drink it
oh<00:01:28.050> yes<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.349> cattle<00:01:29.709> trough<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.369> full<00:01:30.849> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
oh yes the cattle trough is full of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.550 
oh yes the cattle trough is full of
creatures<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:33.630> no<00:01:34.630> squirrels<00:01:35.020> fill<00:01:35.229> in<00:01:35.380> there

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
creatures and no squirrels fill in there

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.809 
creatures and no squirrels fill in there
a<00:01:35.679> lot<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.890> times<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.130> squirrels<00:01:36.429> fall<00:01:36.670> in

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
a lot of times the squirrels fall in

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.940 
a lot of times the squirrels fall in
here<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.330> they're<00:01:37.420> fun<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.720> dig<00:01:38.140> out<00:01:38.319> but

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
here and they're fun to dig out but

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.990 
here and they're fun to dig out but
anyway<00:01:39.819> we're<00:01:40.060> gonna<00:01:40.119> take<00:01:40.390> our<00:01:40.569> pot<00:01:41.319> here<00:01:42.000> I'm

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
anyway we're gonna take our pot here I'm

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.969 
anyway we're gonna take our pot here I'm
gonna<00:01:43.179> scoop<00:01:43.479> up<00:01:43.660> about<00:01:43.929> three<00:01:44.229> liters<00:01:44.410> got

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
gonna scoop up about three liters got

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.249 
gonna scoop up about three liters got
all<00:01:45.069> sorts<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.489> pollen<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.390> floating<00:01:47.050> things

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
all sorts of pollen and floating things

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.550 
all sorts of pollen and floating things
on<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.509> think<00:01:49.569> we'll<00:01:49.869> go<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:50.050> go

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
on there and I think we'll go with go

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.850 
on there and I think we'll go with go
with<00:01:50.739> that<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.310> not<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.759> good<00:01:52.060> source<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.509> water

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
with that so not a good source of water

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.070 
with that so not a good source of water
let's<00:01:53.860> go<00:01:54.069> see<00:01:54.280> if<00:01:54.369> we<00:01:54.429> can<00:01:54.720> distill<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.929> in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
let's go see if we can distill this in

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's go see if we can distill this in
the<00:01:56.170> survival<00:01:56.530> still<00:01:58.950> again<00:01:59.950> when<00:02:00.130> you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the survival still again when you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.219 
the survival still again when you
running<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.179> survival<00:02:01.690> still<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:01.959> think<00:02:02.170> you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
running a survival still I think you

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.919 
running a survival still I think you
need<00:02:02.379> to<00:02:02.470> have<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:03.179> sustainable<00:02:04.179> way<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.539> heat

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
need to have a sustainable way to heat

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.830 
need to have a sustainable way to heat
the<00:02:05.140> still<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.520> use<00:02:06.819> propane<00:02:07.509> or

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
the still and not use propane or

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.779 
the still and not use propane or
electric<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.500> we're<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.280> rocket<00:02:09.610> stove

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
electric so we're on the rocket stove

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.390 
electric so we're on the rocket stove
here<00:02:10.179> rock<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.319> in<00:02:11.410> pretty<00:02:11.650> good<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.220> think

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
here rock it in pretty good I think

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.650 
here rock it in pretty good I think
we're<00:02:12.700> about<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.210> about<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> boil<00:02:14.110> let's<00:02:14.500> see

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
we're about to about to boil let's see

we're about to about to boil let's see
this<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.410> pond<00:02:16.650> water<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.630> we're<00:02:18.900> just

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
this is my pond water and we're just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.380 
this is my pond water and we're just
about<00:02:19.320> ready<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.710> set<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> still<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.970> I'm

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
about ready to set the still on here I'm

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.620 
about ready to set the still on here I'm
going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> get<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.170> water<00:02:22.380> boiling<00:02:22.710> first

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
going to get it that water boiling first

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.100 
going to get it that water boiling first
starting<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> go<00:02:26.480> beating<00:02:27.480> our<00:02:27.570> sticks<00:02:27.930> in

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
starting to go beating our sticks in

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.060 
starting to go beating our sticks in
here<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> rocket<00:02:29.070> stove<00:02:30.890> sounding<00:02:31.890> good

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
here with a rocket stove sounding good

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.680 
here with a rocket stove sounding good
so<00:02:36.170> let's<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.950> baby

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
so let's see if we can get this baby

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.550 
so let's see if we can get this baby
you're<00:02:39.690> gonna<00:02:39.810> stand<00:02:40.080> drinking<00:02:40.470> water<00:02:40.680> here

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
you're gonna stand drinking water here

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.020 
you're gonna stand drinking water here
steam<00:02:43.560> starting<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> come<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> lid

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
steam starting to come out of that lid

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.180 
steam starting to come out of that lid
so<00:02:45.420> we're<00:02:46.230> pretty<00:02:46.350> close<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.860> think<00:02:46.920> we're

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so we're pretty close I think we're

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.320 
so we're pretty close I think we're
ready<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> try<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.420> set<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.580> actual<00:02:50.580> still<00:02:51.090> on

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
ready to try and set the actual still on

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.290 
ready to try and set the actual still on
the<00:02:51.510> pot<00:02:52.310> let's<00:02:53.310> put<00:02:53.460> this<00:02:53.580> thing<00:02:53.640> together

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.870 

okay<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.600> still<00:02:57.840> has<00:02:57.960> been<00:02:58.200> put<00:02:58.380> together

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
okay this still has been put together

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.860 
okay this still has been put together
and<00:03:01.070> we're<00:03:02.070> cooking<00:03:03.000> pretty<00:03:03.360> good<00:03:03.570> right<00:03:03.840> now

shortly and what we're after we put

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.350 
shortly and what we're after we put
three<00:03:10.860> litres<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.250> water<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.850> bottom<00:03:12.150> pot

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
three litres of water in the bottom pot

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.640 
three litres of water in the bottom pot
and<00:03:13.730> we're<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.090> shoot<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.570> 24<00:03:16.230> ounces

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and we're going to shoot for 24 ounces

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.840 
and we're going to shoot for 24 ounces
of<00:03:16.860> water<00:03:17.960> and<00:03:18.960> that'll<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.590> basically<00:03:20.459> at<00:03:20.640> 3

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
of water and that'll be basically at 3

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.810 
of water and that'll be basically at 3
cups<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.690> water<00:03:23.390> I'm<00:03:24.390> out<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.810> process<00:03:25.290> so

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
cups of water I'm out of this process so

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.340 
cups of water I'm out of this process so
see<00:03:26.820> how<00:03:26.970> she<00:03:27.030> does<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.540> think<00:03:27.750> we're<00:03:27.870> set<00:03:28.050> up<00:03:28.110> we

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
see how she does I think we're set up we

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.280 
see how she does I think we're set up we
got<00:03:28.530> our<00:03:28.680> pot<00:03:28.950> here<00:03:28.980> full<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.790> water<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.330> again

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
got our pot here full of water to again

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.320 
got our pot here full of water to again
the<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.160> bad<00:03:32.340> water<00:03:32.580> will<00:03:32.790> come<00:03:32.970> up<00:03:33.000> and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
the the bad water will come up and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.030 
the the bad water will come up and
condense<00:03:33.900> against<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.410> bottom<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.830> steam

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
condense against the bottom the steam

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.470 
condense against the bottom the steam
will<00:03:35.220> hit<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.459> bottom<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.820> pot<00:03:36.000> condense

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
will hit the bottom of the pot condense

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.960 
will hit the bottom of the pot condense
come<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.020> down<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.290> be<00:03:37.500> collected<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
come back down and be collected in the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.850 
come back down and be collected in the
survival<00:03:39.360> still<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.020> then<00:03:40.140> be<00:03:40.260> drained<00:03:40.620> off

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
survival still and then be drained off

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.820 
survival still and then be drained off
through<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.700> tube<00:03:41.910> into<00:03:42.209> our<00:03:42.540> our<00:03:43.350> container

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
through the tube into our our container

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.300 
through the tube into our our container
so<00:03:44.610> long<00:03:45.120> as<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.360> keep<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.750> fire<00:03:45.989> tore<00:03:46.380> we

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
so long as we keep the fire tore we

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.040 
so long as we keep the fire tore we
should<00:03:47.550> get<00:03:47.640> some<00:03:47.910> safe<00:03:48.239> water<00:03:48.510> here<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> drink

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
and out where it runs down into the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.379 
and out where it runs down into the
condensate<00:04:19.570> tube<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.820> we're<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:22.030> here<00:04:22.240> with

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
condensate tube so we're out here with

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.230 
condensate tube so we're out here with
our<00:04:22.570> survival<00:04:23.110> still<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:24.100> this<00:04:24.370> rocket<00:04:25.000> stove

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
our survival still on this rocket stove

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.510 
our survival still on this rocket stove
and<00:04:25.570> we're<00:04:25.690> collecting<00:04:26.080> our<00:04:26.230> water<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.400> our

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
and we're collecting our water in our

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.170 
and we're collecting our water in our
container<00:04:28.919> compared<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.100> ceramics<00:04:30.790> it's<00:04:31.000> a

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
container compared to ceramics it's a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.110 
container compared to ceramics it's a
pretty<00:04:31.510> slow<00:04:31.810> process<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.490> has<00:04:33.639> its<00:04:33.820> place

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
pretty slow process but it has its place

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.760 
pretty slow process but it has its place
you<00:04:34.630> know<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:34.780> many<00:04:35.050> people<00:04:35.380> live<00:04:35.530> along<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
you know so many people live along the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.950 
you know so many people live along the
coast<00:04:35.889> think<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:36.850> Katrina's<00:04:37.419> we<00:04:37.630> think<00:04:37.840> of

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
coast think of Katrina's we think of

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.770 
coast think of Katrina's we think of
sandy<00:04:38.500> hurricane<00:04:38.950> sandy<00:04:39.610> Andrews<00:04:40.150> Irene's

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
sandy hurricane sandy Andrews Irene's

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.159 
sandy hurricane sandy Andrews Irene's
all<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.350> hurricanes<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.750> would<00:04:43.960> work

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
all the hurricanes this this would work

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.900 
all the hurricanes this this would work
this<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.860> really<00:04:45.160> one<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.400> only<00:04:45.460> things

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
this is really one of the only things

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.060 
this is really one of the only things
that<00:04:46.000> would<00:04:46.210> work<00:04:46.360> for<00:04:46.630> ocean<00:04:46.990> water<00:04:47.200> brackish

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
that would work for ocean water brackish

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.280 
that would work for ocean water brackish
water<00:04:48.780> water<00:04:49.780> that's<00:04:49.840> been<00:04:50.110> contaminated

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
water water that's been contaminated

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.020 
water water that's been contaminated
with<00:04:51.280> salt<00:04:51.610> water

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
with salt water

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.390 
with salt water
maybe<00:04:52.510> even<00:04:52.780> well<00:04:52.960> waters<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:53.530> have<00:04:53.650> our<00:04:54.250> own

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
maybe even well waters that have our own

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.860 
maybe even well waters that have our own
wells<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.790> have<00:04:54.910> been<00:04:55.060> contaminated

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
wells that have been contaminated

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.310 
wells that have been contaminated
through<00:04:56.500> flooding<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.430> ocean<00:04:57.760> water<00:04:58.320> excuse

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
through flooding of ocean water excuse

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.800 
through flooding of ocean water excuse
me<00:04:59.639> so<00:05:00.750> though<00:05:01.750> slow<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.370> uh<00:05:03.400> off<00:05:04.270> you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
me so though slow this is uh off you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.690 
me so though slow this is uh off you
know<00:05:04.930> there's<00:05:05.380> plenty<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.860> wood<00:05:05.979> around<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.610> a

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
know there's plenty of wood around and a

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.150 
know there's plenty of wood around and a
and<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.510> bad<00:05:07.690> storm<00:05:08.110> bad<00:05:08.470> hurricane<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:09.100> you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
and a bad storm bad hurricane so you

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.690 
and a bad storm bad hurricane so you
could<00:05:09.430> steal<00:05:09.820> your<00:05:09.970> water<00:05:10.950> again<00:05:11.950> so<00:05:12.400> just

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
could steal your water again so just

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.719 
could steal your water again so just
this<00:05:13.690> is<00:05:13.810> my<00:05:13.930> first<00:05:14.200> test<00:05:14.440> with<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.070> just

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
this is my first test with it so just

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.490 
this is my first test with it so just
make<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.910> comment<00:05:16.330> about<00:05:16.539> how<00:05:16.840> long<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.260> takes

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
make a comment about how long it takes

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.279 
make a comment about how long it takes
to<00:05:17.650> do<00:05:17.950> this<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.750> again<00:05:20.080> I'm<00:05:20.200> not

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
to do this you know again I'm not

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.170 
to do this you know again I'm not
running<00:05:20.590> off<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.740> propane<00:05:21.250> not<00:05:21.760> running<00:05:22.060> off<00:05:22.150> a

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
running off a propane not running off a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.469 
running off a propane not running off a
Coleman<00:05:22.630> stove<00:05:22.919> running<00:05:23.919> off<00:05:24.039> of<00:05:24.070> wood<00:05:24.479> but

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
Coleman stove running off of wood but

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.420 
Coleman stove running off of wood but
you'll<00:05:25.690> find<00:05:25.930> plenty<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.350> debris<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.070> in<00:05:27.340> a

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
you'll find plenty of debris and in a

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.900 
you'll find plenty of debris and in a
bad<00:05:27.660> storm<00:05:28.660> bad<00:05:28.960> crisis<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.430> works<00:05:30.640> good

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
bad storm bad crisis so this works good

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.600 
bad storm bad crisis so this works good
it<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.710> solution<00:05:33.370> I've<00:05:33.490> been

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
it is a it is the a solution I've been

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.360 
it is a it is the a solution I've been
looking<00:05:33.880> for<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> solution<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:34.810> was<00:05:35.370> small

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
looking for a solution that was small

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.810 
looking for a solution that was small
and<00:05:36.729> easy<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.510> put<00:05:38.380> together<00:05:38.470> for<00:05:38.979> those<00:05:39.580> that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
and easy to put together for those that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.290 
and easy to put together for those that
live<00:05:39.940> along<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.270> coast<00:05:40.419> and<00:05:41.789> coastlines<00:05:42.789> and

live along the coast and coastlines and
have<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:43.600> deal<00:05:43.750> with<00:05:43.780> hurricanes<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:45.240> if<00:05:46.240> you

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
have to deal with hurricanes and if you
