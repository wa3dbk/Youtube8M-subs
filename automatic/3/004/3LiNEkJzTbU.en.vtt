$90 just judging on the box size here we

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.120 
$90 just judging on the box size here we
have<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.530> little<00:00:38.680> point<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.010> reference<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.670> the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
have a little point of reference is the

have a little point of reference is the
new<00:00:42.130> droid<00:00:42.520> gunship<00:00:43.060> box<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.840> that<00:00:43.930> gives<00:00:44.140> us

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
new droid gunship box and that gives us

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.050 
new droid gunship box and that gives us
a<00:00:44.290> pretty<00:00:44.470> good<00:00:44.620> idea<00:00:44.920> of<00:00:44.980> how<00:00:45.160> big<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.520> box

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
a pretty good idea of how big this box

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.120 
a pretty good idea of how big this box
is<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:46.630> it<00:00:46.960> looks<00:00:47.260> like<00:00:47.470> it's<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.740> ninety

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
is and it looks like it's a ninety

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.600 
is and it looks like it's a ninety
dollar<00:00:48.340> box<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:49.630> they<00:00:50.590> might<00:00:50.800> surprise<00:00:51.130> us<00:00:51.430> it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
dollar box it they might surprise us it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.760 
dollar box it they might surprise us it
might<00:00:51.790> be<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:52.030> hundred<00:00:52.360> ten<00:00:52.630> but<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.380> really<00:00:53.650> hope

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
might be a hundred ten but I really hope

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.650 
might be a hundred ten but I really hope
it's<00:00:53.980> not<00:00:54.040> but<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:54.850> know<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.270> could<00:00:55.390> go<00:00:55.540> either

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
it's not but you know it could go either

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's not but you know it could go either
way<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.770> we'll<00:00:57.130> have<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.370> wait<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:57.670> see<00:00:57.790> there

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
way so we'll have to wait and see there

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.560 
way so we'll have to wait and see there
it<00:00:59.620> comes<00:00:59.740> with<00:01:00.040> one<00:01:00.310> two<00:01:00.520> three<00:01:00.880> comes<00:01:01.450> with

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
it comes with one two three comes with

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.750 
it comes with one two three comes with
two<00:01:01.780> new<00:01:02.020> minifigures<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.950> seven<00:01:03.460> different

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
two new minifigures and seven different

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.570 
two new minifigures and seven different
minifigures<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.720> believe<00:01:05.680> I<00:01:05.860> counted<00:01:06.220> there's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
minifigures I believe I counted there's

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.340 
minifigures I believe I counted there's
seven<00:01:07.119> normal<00:01:07.570> battle<00:01:07.869> droids<00:01:08.079> in<00:01:08.259> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
seven normal battle droids in the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.469 
seven normal battle droids in the
picture<00:01:08.619> but<00:01:09.310> there<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.640> don't<00:01:09.790> see<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.270> blue

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
picture but there I don't see the blue

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.310 
picture but there I don't see the blue
ones<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:10.990> I'm<00:01:11.079> assuming<00:01:11.320> he's<00:01:11.829> inside<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.290> I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
ones so I'm assuming he's inside but I

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.140 
ones so I'm assuming he's inside but I
don't<00:01:14.560> know<00:01:14.650> how<00:01:14.890> many<00:01:14.950> total<00:01:15.730> there<00:01:16.120> are

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
don't know how many total there are

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.940 
don't know how many total there are
because<00:01:16.600> there<00:01:16.780> could<00:01:16.900> be<00:01:16.960> more<00:01:17.290> inside<00:01:17.650> that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
because there could be more inside that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.170 
because there could be more inside that
they're<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.159> showing<00:01:18.580> here<00:01:18.760> because<00:01:19.060> we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
they're not showing here because we

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.910 
they're not showing here because we
don't<00:01:19.360> see<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.720> one<00:01:19.930> in<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.590> picture

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920

and we also get a brand new droid stap

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.719 
and we also get a brand new droid stap
design<00:01:41.350> which<00:01:41.650> really<00:01:41.860> excites<00:01:42.010> me<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.460> really

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
design which really excites me I really

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.910 
design which really excites me I really
like<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.090> design<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.600> looks<00:01:43.750> pretty<00:01:44.680> good

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
like this design it looks pretty good

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.649 
like this design it looks pretty good
compared<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.790> old<00:01:45.909> ones<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.210> does<00:01:46.330> look<00:01:46.479> a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
compared to the old ones it does look a

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.630 
compared to the old ones it does look a
lot<00:01:46.900> bulkier<00:01:47.680> though<00:01:47.950> like<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.490> mid

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
lot bulkier though like in the mid

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.039 
lot bulkier though like in the mid
section<00:01:48.909> they're<00:01:49.270> like<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.750> little<00:01:49.930> bit

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
section they're like it's a little bit

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.200 
section they're like it's a little bit
wider<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.440> guess<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.880> might<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.180> a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
wider I guess so that might be a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.030 
wider I guess so that might be a
downside<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> don't<00:01:53.380> know<00:01:53.500> we'll<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.890> wait

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
downside I don't know we'll have to wait

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.859 
downside I don't know we'll have to wait
and<00:01:54.159> see<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.590> MTT<00:01:57.070> itself<00:01:57.460> doesn't<00:01:58.180> hold<00:01:58.540> very

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
and see the MTT itself doesn't hold very

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.780 
and see the MTT itself doesn't hold very
many<00:01:59.080> droids<00:01:59.500> obviously<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.159> old<00:02:00.340> one<00:02:00.610> I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
many droids obviously the old one I

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
many droids obviously the old one I
think<00:02:01.150> held<00:02:01.619> 16<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:03.040> its<00:02:03.369> little<00:02:03.700> compartment

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
think held 16 in its little compartment

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.800 
think held 16 in its little compartment
this<00:02:05.770> one<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.130> obviously<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.939> lot<00:02:07.119> smaller<00:02:07.540> you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
this one is obviously a lot smaller you

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.929 
this one is obviously a lot smaller you
can<00:02:07.930> tell<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> lot<00:02:08.560> less<00:02:08.799> detail<00:02:09.310> put<00:02:09.549> into<00:02:09.610> this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:09.939 
can tell a lot less detail put into this

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.080 
can tell a lot less detail put into this
one<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.569> appears<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.709> just<00:02:12.189> don't<00:02:12.430> like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
one that it appears I just don't like

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.990 
one that it appears I just don't like
the<00:02:13.689> way<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.170> looks<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:15.010> looks<00:02:15.280> very<00:02:15.370> dumbed

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the way this looks it looks very dumbed

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.690 
the way this looks it looks very dumbed
down<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:17.319> old<00:02:17.470> one<00:02:17.740> was<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.370> amazing

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
down the old one was just so amazing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.040 
down the old one was just so amazing
there<00:02:19.000> was<00:02:19.090> no<00:02:19.270> way<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:19.510> were<00:02:19.599> gonna<00:02:19.720> top

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
there was no way they were gonna top

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.320 
there was no way they were gonna top
that<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.400> they<00:02:21.550> could<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.849> also

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
that but I think they could have also

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.160 
that but I think they could have also
come<00:02:22.690> out<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:22.930> like

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
come out with like

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
come out with like
the<00:02:23.230> Clone<00:02:23.470> Wars<00:02:23.500> version<00:02:24.040> where<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.310> was<00:02:24.400> blue

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
the Clone Wars version where it was blue

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.210 
the Clone Wars version where it was blue
and<00:02:24.910> gray<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:26.230> wouldn't<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.590> been<00:02:26.740> bad<00:02:26.920> but

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
and gray that wouldn't have been bad but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.699 
and gray that wouldn't have been bad but
I<00:02:27.459> think<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:28.840> ultimately<00:02:28.959> decided<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> go

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
I think they ultimately decided to go

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.620 
I think they ultimately decided to go
with<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.950> color<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.970> don't<00:02:31.239> think

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
with this color and I just don't think

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.970 
with this color and I just don't think
it<00:02:31.750> turned<00:02:31.989> out<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.380> well<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.680> they

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
it turned out that well I think they

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
it turned out that well I think they
should<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.160> scrapped<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.790> set<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.300> came

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
should have scrapped this set and came

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720 
should have scrapped this set and came
out<00:02:35.050> with<00:02:35.200> something<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.650> an<00:02:35.800> AAT<00:02:36.069> instead

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
out with something like an AAT instead

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.990 
out with something like an AAT instead
like<00:02:36.970> some<00:02:37.239> people<00:02:37.510> suggested<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> might<00:02:38.410> be

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
like some people suggested it might be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.190 
like some people suggested it might be
but<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.239> see<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.540> pretty<00:02:40.690> flat<00:02:41.050> on

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
but as you can see it's pretty flat on

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.229 
but as you can see it's pretty flat on
the<00:02:41.290> sides<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.770> mean<00:02:42.130> maybe<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.670> more<00:02:42.880> movie

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the sides I mean maybe it's more movie

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.760 
the sides I mean maybe it's more movie
accurate<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.989> go<00:02:44.110> back<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.440> look<00:02:44.530> at<00:02:44.739> it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
accurate off to go back and look at it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.850 
accurate off to go back and look at it
and<00:02:45.540> hopefully<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.630> pick<00:02:46.959> up<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.319> older

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and hopefully I can pick up the older

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.220 
and hopefully I can pick up the older
MTT<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.520> compare<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.630> they

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
MTT to compare it to that because they

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.410 
MTT to compare it to that because they
will<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.530> very<00:02:50.680> comparable<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.670> terms<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.120> size

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
will be very comparable in terms of size

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.770 
will be very comparable in terms of size
and<00:02:52.900> design<00:02:53.400> compared<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.670> 2007<00:02:55.480> model

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and design compared to the 2007 model

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.590 
and design compared to the 2007 model
which<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.190> much<00:02:57.370> better<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.850> it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
which was just so so much better and it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.780 
which was just so so much better and it
did<00:02:58.989> only<00:02:59.110> cost<00:02:59.410> $100<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.100> if<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.310> cost<00:03:00.580> more

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
did only cost $100 so if this cost more

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.449 
did only cost $100 so if this cost more
than<00:03:00.910> $100<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.600> would<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:01.870> very<00:03:02.080> surprised<00:03:02.620> for

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
than $100 I would be very surprised for

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.150 
than $100 I would be very surprised for
such<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> large<00:03:04.180> downscale<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.380> set<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.860> for

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
such a large downscale of a set in for

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.890 
such a large downscale of a set in for
it<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.340> still<00:03:06.519> cost<00:03:06.760> more<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.690> we're<00:03:07.810> gonna

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
it to still cost more so we're gonna

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.000 
it to still cost more so we're gonna
have<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.110> wait<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.319> see<00:03:08.380> guys<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:08.920> about

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
have to wait and see guys that's about

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.680 
have to wait and see guys that's about
it<00:03:09.190> for<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.430> video<00:03:09.730> I'll<00:03:10.120> catch<00:03:10.420> y'all<00:03:10.660> next

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.860 
it for this video I'll catch y'all next
one<00:03:11.170> which<00:03:11.319> will<00:03:11.470> probably<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.910> death<00:03:13.540> star

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
one which will probably be a death star

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.930 
one which will probably be a death star
review<00:03:14.350> or<00:03:14.620> something<00:03:15.069> maybe<00:03:15.459> an<00:03:15.640> update
