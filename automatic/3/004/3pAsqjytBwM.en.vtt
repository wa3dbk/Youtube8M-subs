out the candy bars you know but I find a
lot<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:55.110> times<00:01:55.410> when<00:01:55.560> people<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.369> sugar

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
lot of times when people get a all sugar

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.810 
lot of times when people get a all sugar
all<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.240> once<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:59.250> could<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.460> too<00:01:59.670> much

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
all at once it's it could be too much

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.470 
all at once it's it could be too much
and<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.630> could<00:02:00.960> only

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
and they could only

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.570 
and they could only
the<00:02:02.630> muscle<00:02:02.900> cells<00:02:03.110> up<00:02:03.320> for<00:02:03.560> disaster<00:02:03.830> and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
the muscle cells up for disaster and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.450 
the muscle cells up for disaster and
feel<00:02:05.120> guilty<00:02:05.510> afterwards<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.740> always<00:02:07.250> say

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
feel guilty afterwards so I always say

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.850 
feel guilty afterwards so I always say
do<00:02:07.700> things<00:02:07.940> one<00:02:08.150> step<00:02:08.180> at<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.630> time<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.500> that

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
do things one step at a time and that

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.980 
do things one step at a time and that
way<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.100> look<00:02:10.490> at<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.700> more<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> long<00:02:11.690> term

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
way you look at it more on the long term

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.280 
way you look at it more on the long term
you<00:02:12.830> see<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.550> something<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.600> these<00:02:15.140> are

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
you see it as something that these are

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.520

that you're going to maintain and do

forever and that at some point and it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.000 
forever and that at some point and it
future<00:02:24.390> you're<00:02:25.079> not<00:02:25.230> even<00:02:25.349> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.769> case

future you're not even going to be case

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.949 
future you're not even going to be case
but<00:02:26.310> you're<00:02:26.519> not<00:02:26.640> even<00:02:26.939> going<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.299> be<00:02:27.420> tempted

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
but you're not even going to be tempted

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.050 
but you're not even going to be tempted
by<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.379> students<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.370> find<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.939> do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
by these students and I find if you do

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.089 
by these students and I find if you do
it<00:02:30.239> slowly<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.230> gently<00:02:31.790> way<00:02:32.790> easier<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.349> sit

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
it slowly and gently way easier so sit

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.470 
it slowly and gently way easier so sit
down<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.459> think<00:02:35.489> about<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.060> what<00:02:36.329> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
down and think about you know what is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.539 
down and think about you know what is
one<00:02:36.719> of<00:02:36.840> those<00:02:36.930> foods<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.469> you<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.430> know

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
one of those foods that you you know

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.309 
one of those foods that you you know
you're<00:02:38.879> addicted<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.810> you're<00:02:40.019> like

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
you're addicted to that you're like

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.280 
you're addicted to that you're like
compulsively<00:02:41.129> need<00:02:41.489> every<00:02:42.030> single<00:02:42.239> day<00:02:42.629> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
compulsively need every single day and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.790 
compulsively need every single day and
she's<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.680> one<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.340> those

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.880 

and<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.270> can<00:02:51.480> creatively<00:02:51.990> come<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.620> with

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
and what you can creatively come up with

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
and what you can creatively come up with
that<00:02:53.520> might<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.910> either<00:02:54.150> healthier<00:02:54.750> version

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that might be either healthier version

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.860 
that might be either healthier version
or<00:02:55.770> something<00:02:56.190> else<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:57.180> eat<00:02:57.240> instead

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
or something else to eat instead

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.350 
or something else to eat instead
something<00:02:58.500> else<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:59.040> makes<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.060> feel<00:03:00.330> good

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
something else that makes you feel good

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.750 
something else that makes you feel good
but<00:03:00.990> it's<00:03:01.170> healthy<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.040> know<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.340> main<00:03:02.490> thing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
but it's healthy you know the main thing

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.790 
but it's healthy you know the main thing
is<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.720> someone's<00:03:04.110> used<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.440> having

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
is is that if someone's used to having

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.650 
is is that if someone's used to having
that<00:03:04.950> candy<00:03:05.370> bar<00:03:05.400> four<00:03:05.880> o'clock<00:03:06.120> every<00:03:06.480> day

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
that candy bar four o'clock every day

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.860 
that candy bar four o'clock every day
because<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.830> an<00:03:07.950> energy<00:03:08.130> swamp<00:03:08.870> they

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
because they have an energy swamp they

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.210 
because they have an energy swamp they
have<00:03:09.990> an<00:03:10.110> energy

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
have an energy

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.580 
have an energy
so<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.210> kind<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.540> candy<00:03:14.230> bar<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.440> they

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
so it's a kind of candy bar and they

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.650 
so it's a kind of candy bar and they
don't<00:03:14.710> have<00:03:14.890> anything<00:03:15.100> else<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:16.090> might<00:03:16.360> just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
don't have anything else it might just

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.070 
don't have anything else it might just
make<00:03:17.080> them<00:03:17.320> feel<00:03:17.590> groggy<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.550> bad<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.210> hungry

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
make them feel groggy and bad and hungry

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.960 
make them feel groggy and bad and hungry
so<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.890> lot<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.250> times<00:03:21.490> they<00:03:21.610> have<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.790> figure

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
so a lot of times they have to figure

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.000 
so a lot of times they have to figure
out<00:03:22.090> well<00:03:22.660> what<00:03:22.690> else<00:03:23.020> can<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:23.530> instead

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
out well what else can I have instead

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.770 
out well what else can I have instead
you<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.550> it's<00:03:24.760> only<00:03:24.940> cutting<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.540> things

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
you know it's only cutting the things

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.530 
you know it's only cutting the things
out<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.470> what<00:03:26.890> you're<00:03:27.070> going<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> add<00:03:27.400> in

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
out but it's what you're going to add in

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.390 
out but it's what you're going to add in
so<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.870> think<00:03:29.110> about<00:03:29.320> healthy<00:03:29.770> healthier

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so and think about healthy healthier

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.610 
so and think about healthy healthier
food<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.910> eat<00:03:31.150> perhaps<00:03:32.020> it's<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.500> be

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
food to eat perhaps it's going to be

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.190 
food to eat perhaps it's going to be
some<00:03:32.830> fruit<00:03:33.130> or<00:03:33.460> perhaps<00:03:34.210> it's<00:03:34.600> going<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.840> be<00:03:34.990> a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
some fruit or perhaps it's going to be a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.410 
some fruit or perhaps it's going to be a
nice<00:03:35.470> solid<00:03:35.800> or<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.880> know<00:03:36.940> having<00:03:37.270> more

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
nice solid or you know having more

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.180 
nice solid or you know having more
vegetables<00:03:37.930> at<00:03:38.080> lunch<00:03:38.290> time<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.040> your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
not that kind of stuff

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.350 
not that kind of stuff
taking<00:03:43.950> things<00:03:44.069> one<00:03:44.280> step<00:03:44.340> at<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.849> time<00:03:44.880> and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
taking things one step at a time and

seeing what it needs and when it doesn't
and<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.370> remember<00:03:50.520> one<00:03:51.030> thing<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:52.260> usually

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and just remember one thing that usually

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.720 
and just remember one thing that usually
it<00:03:52.800> takes<00:03:52.830> about<00:03:53.450> three<00:03:54.450> days<00:03:54.480> too<00:03:55.230> weak<00:03:55.730> to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
it takes about three days too weak to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.970 
it takes about three days too weak to
feel<00:03:57.060> better<00:03:57.420> after<00:03:58.050> letting<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.500> some<00:03:58.860> of

these
x<00:04:01.550> first<00:04:02.120> day<00:04:02.360> he<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.319> quite<00:04:03.470> difficult

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
x first day he can be quite difficult

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.949

people think oh I can't do this it's

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.290 
people think oh I can't do this it's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
just too difficult and too addictive but

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.970 
just too difficult and too addictive but
if<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.540> give<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:09.140> know<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.410> first<00:04:09.620> day<00:04:09.860> is
