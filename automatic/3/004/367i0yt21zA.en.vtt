00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 

so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> playing<00:00:37.590> these<00:00:37.770> strips<00:00:38.130> down<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.640> 1/8<00:00:39.060> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so I playing these strips down to 1/8 of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.460 
so I playing these strips down to 1/8 of
an<00:00:39.300> inch<00:00:39.390> thick<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.780> eventually<00:00:40.350> they're

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
an inch thick and eventually they're

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.750 
an inch thick and eventually they're
going<00:00:40.560> to<00:00:40.650> be<00:00:40.710> glued<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> front<00:00:41.490> and<00:00:41.580> back

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
going to be glued on the front and back

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800 
going to be glued on the front and back
so<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.060> get<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.450> nice<00:00:43.280> stripe<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.550> red<00:00:45.300> oak<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
so I get this nice stripe of red oak and

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.640 
so I get this nice stripe of red oak and
they<00:00:46.740> will<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.540> front<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.380> but

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
they will be in the front and back but

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.200 
they will be in the front and back but
first<00:00:50.580> I<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.240> to<00:00:51.480> cut<00:00:51.900> out<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> actual<00:00:53.880> shape

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
first I need to cut out the actual shape

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
first I need to cut out the actual shape
of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.570> clock<00:00:55.200> itself<00:00:55.560> I<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> remove<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
of the clock itself I need to remove the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
of the clock itself I need to remove the
outside<00:00:56.970> material<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.770> inside

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
outside material and also this inside

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:25.340 
outside material and also this inside
cavity<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.090> insert<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.809> bed

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 

in<00:01:26.159> order<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.400> change<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.120> batteries<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in order to change the batteries in the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
in order to change the batteries in the
clock<00:01:28.620> mechanism<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.700> gonna<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.940> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
clock mechanism you're gonna have to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
clock mechanism you're gonna have to
remove<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.479> center<00:01:30.810> section<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.440> reach<00:01:32.010> up

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
remove this center section and reach up

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.680 
remove this center section and reach up
in<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.820> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> waste<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
in there but I don't want to waste this

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.850 
in there but I don't want to waste this
center<00:01:33.990> section<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.440> actually<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.800> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
center section I'm actually going to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.940 
center section I'm actually going to
treat<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.840> bandsaw<00:01:36.840> box<00:01:37.080> drawer<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
treat this like a bandsaw box drawer and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.090 
treat this like a bandsaw box drawer and
hollow<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.940> out<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.240> before<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
hollow it out but before I do I want to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.090 
hollow it out but before I do I want to
take<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.550> couple<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.090> magnets<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.100> embed

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
take a couple of these magnets and embed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
take a couple of these magnets and embed
them<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.550> backside<00:01:45.150> one<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.660> top<00:01:45.900> one<00:01:46.200> on

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
them in the backside one on top one on

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
them in the backside one on top one on
bottom<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.580> same<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
bottom and do the same thing in the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.140 
bottom and do the same thing in the
corresponding<00:01:49.229> oak<00:01:50.100> piece<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.729> goes<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> the

corresponding oak piece that goes in the
back<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.970> once<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.240> ready<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
back and that way once you're ready to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.469 
back and that way once you're ready to
put<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> back<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.340> magnets<00:01:56.910> will<00:01:57.119> engage

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
put this back in the magnets will engage

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
put this back in the magnets will engage
and<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.110> slide<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.759> will

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and you can slide it back in you will

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.020 
and you can slide it back in you will
have<00:01:59.910> hidden<00:02:00.300> storage<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> nobody<00:02:01.860> will<00:02:02.039> know

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.750 

a<00:02:09.350> couple<00:02:10.350> of<00:02:10.500> important<00:02:10.950> things<00:02:10.979> real<00:02:11.459> quick

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
a couple of important things real quick

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.729 
a couple of important things real quick
back<00:02:12.420> side<00:02:12.780> where<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> magnets<00:02:13.470> are<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
back side where the magnets are going to

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.860 
back side where the magnets are going to
mount<00:02:13.860> i've<00:02:14.160> also<00:02:14.670> drilled<00:02:15.060> two<00:02:15.330> holes<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
mount i've also drilled two holes in the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.020 
mount i've also drilled two holes in the
bottom<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.200> finger<00:02:16.739> grabs<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.550> way<00:02:17.760> once

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
bottom for finger grabs that way once

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
bottom for finger grabs that way once
it's<00:02:18.209> held<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.050> place<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.950> pull<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.310> down

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
it's held in place you can pull it down

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.550 
it's held in place you can pull it down
from<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.850> bottom<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.720> once<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.110> slide<00:02:22.410> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
from the bottom now once you slide it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470 
from the bottom now once you slide it
back<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.010> place<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.640> clock<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.360> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
back in place the clock is going to be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
back in place the clock is going to be
basically<00:02:25.350> right<00:02:25.560> here<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.980> clock<00:02:26.190> mechanism

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
basically right here the clock mechanism

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.180 
basically right here the clock mechanism
so<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.989> blue<00:02:28.230> peat<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.920> blue

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
so all of this blue peat this blue

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
so all of this blue peat this blue
material<00:02:29.670> needs<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.970> completely<00:02:30.420> removed

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
material needs to be completely removed

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.710 
material needs to be completely removed
once<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.410> done<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.760> cut<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> back<00:02:33.480> off

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
once that's done I can cut the back off

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.259 
once that's done I can cut the back off
cut<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> front<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:34.769> turn<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> sideways<00:02:36.000> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
cut the front off turn it sideways and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.780 
cut the front off turn it sideways and
hog<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.140> middle<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
hog out the middle just like a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.940 
hog out the middle just like a
traditional<00:02:38.970> bandsaw<00:02:39.660> box<00:02:39.900> drawer<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.799> then

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
traditional bandsaw box drawer and then

00:02:40.950 --> 00:03:36.330 
traditional bandsaw box drawer and then
put<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.790> back<00:02:42.000> together

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.030 

i<00:03:36.690> ruffcut<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> back<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.349> installed<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
i ruffcut the back and installed the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.370 
i ruffcut the back and installed the
magnets<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.760> ran<00:03:40.120> into<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.480> big<00:03:40.810> problem

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
magnets and ran into a big problem

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.040 
magnets and ran into a big problem
my<00:03:41.620> plan<00:03:41.920> was<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.220> use<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> flush<00:03:43.150> magnet<00:03:43.780> here

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
my plan was to use a flush magnet here

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.570 
my plan was to use a flush magnet here
and<00:03:44.310> two<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.520> here<00:03:45.819> as<00:03:45.970> well<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:48.069> problem<00:03:48.400> is

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
and two in here as well the problem is

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.160 
and two in here as well the problem is
these<00:03:48.819> magnets<00:03:49.239> are<00:03:49.300> very<00:03:49.510> strong<00:03:49.870> when<00:03:50.080> you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
these magnets are very strong when you

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.809 
these magnets are very strong when you
pull<00:03:50.440> them<00:03:50.560> apart<00:03:50.770> from<00:03:51.220> one<00:03:51.370> another

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
pull them apart from one another

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.880 
pull them apart from one another
but<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.390> when<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.780> slide<00:03:53.110> them<00:03:53.290> against<00:03:53.680> one

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
but not when you slide them against one

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.729 
but not when you slide them against one
of<00:03:53.920> their<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.780> what<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.170> was<00:03:56.380> having

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
of their like this and what I was having

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.190 
of their like this and what I was having
is<00:03:56.950> when<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> magnets<00:03:58.450> engaged<00:03:58.840> I

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
is when I have the magnets engaged I

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.770 
is when I have the magnets engaged I
barely<00:03:59.830> could<00:04:00.130> pick<00:04:00.340> up<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.670> weight<00:04:00.910> of<00:04:01.180> the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
barely could pick up the weight of the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.830 
barely could pick up the weight of the
actual<00:04:02.170> door<00:04:02.410> itself<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.940> what<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.450> had<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.630> do

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
actual door itself so what I had to do

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.070 
actual door itself so what I had to do
is<00:04:05.140> double<00:04:05.650> up<00:04:05.800> both<00:04:06.190> series<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.819> magnets<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
is double up both series of magnets the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.590 
is double up both series of magnets the
bottom<00:04:08.500> one<00:04:08.680> on<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.280> doubled<00:04:09.640> up<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.910> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
bottom one on this is doubled up and the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.320 
bottom one on this is doubled up and the
top<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.110> in<00:04:11.230> here<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.590> doubled<00:04:12.160> up<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.489> to

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
top one in here is doubled up and to

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.000 
top one in here is doubled up and to
test<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.810> strength<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.350> filled<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.769> with<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
test the strength I filled it with a

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.590 
test the strength I filled it with a
bunch<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.489> screws<00:04:15.880> which<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.209> honestly

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
bunch of screws which is honestly

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.270 
bunch of screws which is honestly
probably<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:17.290> weight<00:04:17.560> than<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:18.100> thing

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
probably more weight than this thing

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.040 
probably more weight than this thing
will<00:04:18.459> ever<00:04:18.579> see<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:21.270> once<00:04:22.270> they<00:04:22.479> are<00:04:22.510> engaged

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
will ever see and once they are engaged

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.080 
will ever see and once they are engaged
it's<00:04:23.770> not<00:04:24.100> going<00:04:24.490> anywhere

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
it's not going anywhere

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.730 
it's not going anywhere
so<00:04:25.419> I'm<00:04:25.690> going<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.900> say<00:04:26.139> that<00:04:26.350> that's<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.680> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so I'm going to say that that's going to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.840 
so I'm going to say that that's going to
be<00:04:26.919> all<00:04:27.070> right<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:29.139> not<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.250> way<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.370> wanted<00:04:30.729> it

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
be all right so not the way I wanted it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.020 
be all right so not the way I wanted it
but<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.150> will<00:04:31.270> work<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:33.220> only<00:04:33.370> problem<00:04:33.700> is

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
but it will work and the only problem is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.180 
but it will work and the only problem is
I've<00:04:34.450> got<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.720> big<00:04:35.139> ugly<00:04:35.380> gap<00:04:35.860> right<00:04:36.130> here

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
I've got this big ugly gap right here

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.090 
I've got this big ugly gap right here
and<00:04:36.550> I'm<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.820> cut<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.210> down<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:38.100> things

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
and I'm going to cut this down so things

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.560 
and I'm going to cut this down so things
don't<00:04:39.340> always<00:04:39.490> work<00:04:39.669> out<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.180> way<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.330> want

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
don't always work out the way you want

00:04:40.570 --> 00:05:46.860 
don't always work out the way you want
them<00:04:40.660> to

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.350 

you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.300 

you<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.720> use<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.900> piece<00:05:50.169> of<00:05:50.199> this<00:05:50.650> double-sided

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
you can use a piece of this double-sided

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.420 
you can use a piece of this double-sided
carpet<00:05:51.789> tape<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.509> attach<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:53.139> movement<00:05:53.650> to

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
carpet tape to attach the movement to

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:05.920 
carpet tape to attach the movement to
the<00:05:54.460> actual<00:05:55.150> clock<00:05:55.509> body

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.230

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
hi guys so this is the finished clock I

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.270 
hi guys so this is the finished clock I
hope<00:06:08.419> you've<00:06:08.600> enjoyed<00:06:08.960> watching<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.979> as<00:06:10.039> much

hope you've enjoyed watching it as much
as<00:06:10.400> if<00:06:10.520> I've<00:06:10.639> enjoyed<00:06:11.030> making<00:06:11.570> it<00:06:11.720> this<00:06:11.840> has

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
as if I've enjoyed making it this has

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.390 
as if I've enjoyed making it this has
been<00:06:12.110> one<00:06:12.229> of<00:06:12.259> the<00:06:12.350> projects<00:06:12.830> that<00:06:12.949> have

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
been one of the projects that have

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.969 
been one of the projects that have
really<00:06:14.360> tested<00:06:14.630> my<00:06:15.080> temper<00:06:15.500> throughout<00:06:15.830> the

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
really tested my temper throughout the

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.129 
really tested my temper throughout the
build<00:06:16.190> one<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.240> projects<00:06:17.630> where<00:06:17.810> nothing

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
build one of the projects where nothing

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.900 
build one of the projects where nothing
is<00:06:18.229> gone<00:06:18.440> right<00:06:18.710> but<00:06:19.039> in<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.370> end<00:06:19.490> I'm<00:06:19.699> very

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
is gone right but in the end I'm very

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.969 
is gone right but in the end I'm very
happy<00:06:20.240> with<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.630> final<00:06:20.870> result<00:06:21.169> I've<00:06:21.770> got<00:06:21.949> a

happy with the final result I've got a

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.830 
happy with the final result I've got a
couple<00:06:22.190> flaws<00:06:22.580> that<00:06:23.000> I<00:06:23.030> didn't<00:06:23.419> plan<00:06:23.660> on

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
couple flaws that I didn't plan on

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.249 
couple flaws that I didn't plan on
having<00:06:24.100> but<00:06:25.100> oh<00:06:25.610> well<00:06:26.360> it<00:06:26.630> still<00:06:26.900> turned<00:06:27.139> out

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
having but oh well it still turned out

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.870 
having but oh well it still turned out
pretty<00:06:27.530> cool<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.190> I've<00:06:28.370> got<00:06:28.520> this<00:06:28.669> nice

pretty cool and I've got this nice

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.670 
pretty cool and I've got this nice
little<00:06:28.940> hidden<00:06:29.360> storage<00:06:29.750> in<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.139> bottom<00:06:30.470> so

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
little hidden storage in the bottom so

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.260 
little hidden storage in the bottom so
I'm<00:06:31.280> gonna<00:06:31.370> go<00:06:31.460> ahead<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.639> give<00:06:31.820> this<00:06:31.940> away<00:06:32.210> to
