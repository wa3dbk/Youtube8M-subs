00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
you leave and so when everybody was
trying<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> rush<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.090> doors<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> lot<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
trying to rush out the doors a lot of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
trying to rush out the doors a lot of
the<00:01:39.990> bouncers<00:01:40.380> didn't<00:01:40.710> realize<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.790> was

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the bouncers didn't realize what was

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.160 
the bouncers didn't realize what was
going<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.270> didn't<00:01:42.570> realize<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
going on didn't realize that there was a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.450 
going on didn't realize that there was a
fire<00:01:43.380> inside<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.159> were<00:01:44.220> actually

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
fire inside and so they were actually

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
fire inside and so they were actually
trying<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> block<00:01:45.090> people<00:01:45.479> from<00:01:45.509> leaving

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
trying to block people from leaving

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.240 
trying to block people from leaving
thinking<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.710> hadn't<00:01:47.070> paid<00:01:47.220> their

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
thinking that they hadn't paid their

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
thinking that they hadn't paid their
tabs<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> didn't<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.390> realize<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.960> don't

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
tabs and didn't really realize I don't

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
tabs and didn't really realize I don't
think<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> case<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.100> mal-intent

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think it was really a case of mal-intent

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
think it was really a case of mal-intent
I<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.000> didn't<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> point

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I just didn't think that at that point

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.440 
I just didn't think that at that point
they<00:01:52.170> realized<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> fire<00:01:52.950> had<00:01:52.979> started

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
they realized that the fire had started

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
they realized that the fire had started
and<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:55.380> John<00:01:55.680> mentioned<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.520> though

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and now as John mentioned it was though

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
and now as John mentioned it was though
they<00:01:57.630> believe<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> band's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
they believe it was the band's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.350 
they believe it was the band's
pyrotechnics<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> started<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> fire<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pyrotechnics that started the fire and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
pyrotechnics that started the fire and
so<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.659> band<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.290> seeing<00:02:01.530> some<00:02:01.710> backlash

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so now the band is seeing some backlash

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.929 
so now the band is seeing some backlash
and<00:02:02.640> hostile<00:02:03.390> messages<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> social<00:02:04.140> media

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
and hostile messages on social media

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
and hostile messages on social media
saying<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> pay<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.049> what

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
saying that they have to pay for what

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.330 
saying that they have to pay for what
happened<00:02:07.890> until

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
happened until

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
happened until
our<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.729> afraid<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.239> retaliation<00:02:09.750> out

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
our kind of afraid of a retaliation out

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.860 
our kind of afraid of a retaliation out

first ones to notice the fire now if

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.990 
first ones to notice the fire now if
you're<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.290> dark<00:02:25.980> possibly<00:02:26.549> smoking

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you're in a dark possibly smoking

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.190 
you're in a dark possibly smoking
nightclub<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.720> fact<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:27.989> there's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
nightclub the fact that there's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.420 
nightclub the fact that there's
additional<00:02:28.410> smoke<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> might<00:02:29.160> take<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> while

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
additional smoke it might take a while

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.740 
additional smoke it might take a while
especially<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:30.090> its<00:02:30.209> large<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.629> there's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
especially if its large and there's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
especially if its large and there's
literally<00:02:31.019> thousands<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.739> people<00:02:32.069> but<00:02:32.910> they

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
literally thousands of people but they

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
literally thousands of people but they
did<00:02:33.299> notice<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> fire<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.319> were<00:02:34.410> able

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
did notice the fire and they were able

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.460

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
to get out uh I mean you can't

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.229 
to get out uh I mean you can't
necessarily<00:02:37.709> blame<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:39.030> because

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
necessarily blame them because

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.789 
necessarily blame them because
apparently<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.930> had<00:02:40.110> used<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.620> same

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
apparently they had used the same

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.979 
apparently they had used the same
pyrotechnics<00:02:41.489> without<00:02:42.060> problems<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.840> other

pyrotechnics without problems at other
venues<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.739> was<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.250> combination<00:02:44.430> of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
venues it was just a combination of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.370 
venues it was just a combination of
their<00:02:45.090> particular<00:02:45.329> pyrotechnics<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.260> the

particular sound insulating material at
that<00:02:48.150> club<00:02:48.450> uh<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.040> imagine<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that club uh but I have to imagine that

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.259 
that club uh but I have to imagine that
just<00:02:52.260> mentally<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.220> has<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
just mentally this has got to be I

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.150 
just mentally this has got to be I
couldn't<00:02:55.079> even<00:02:55.140> imagine<00:02:55.290> how<00:02:55.680> devastating

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
couldn't even imagine how devastating

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.410 
couldn't even imagine how devastating
this<00:02:56.280> because<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.819> know<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.150> they<00:02:57.269> did

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
this because they know that they did

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.940 
this because they know that they did
cause<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.530> uh<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.700> people<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> city

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
cause it and uh the people in that city

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.680 
cause it and uh the people in that city
are<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.129> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.459> fans<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.150> group<00:03:03.450> yeah
