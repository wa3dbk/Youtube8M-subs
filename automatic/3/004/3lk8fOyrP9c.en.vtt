around it really helps you get all those
little<00:01:48.810> split<00:01:49.110> ends<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:50.579> happened<00:01:50.909> up

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
little split ends that that happened up

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
little split ends that that happened up
here<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> end<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
here and then at the end you can just

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
here and then at the end you can just
kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.090> bottom<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> get

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
kind of go around your bottom and get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.870 
kind of go around your bottom and get
those<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.079> bits<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
those little bits and that's it so you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
those little bits and that's it so you
can<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:00.960> bored<00:02:01.259> or

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can just do that when you're bored or

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.300 
can just do that when you're bored or
listening<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> music<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:04.950> do

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
listening to music and I actually do

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
listening to music and I actually do
them<00:02:05.460> once<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.719> hair<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.020> specific<00:02:07.560> days

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
them once I cut my hair on specific days

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.120 
them once I cut my hair on specific days
according<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> lunar<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
according to the lunar so

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.640 
according to the lunar so
and<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:10.540> know<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.810> probably<00:02:11.080> sounds<00:02:11.140> kind<00:02:11.590> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
and I know that probably sounds kind of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.500 
and I know that probably sounds kind of
strange<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.670> find<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:13.240> interesting
