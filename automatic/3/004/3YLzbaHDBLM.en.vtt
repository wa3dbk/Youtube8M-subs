00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
okay you guys I am so excited about

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.300 
okay you guys I am so excited about
these<00:00:14.059> I<00:00:14.630> got<00:00:15.379> some<00:00:15.770> really<00:00:16.219> good<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.360> hydros

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
these I got some really good and hydros

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.950 
these I got some really good and hydros
went<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.520> pick<00:00:19.760> up<00:00:19.880> some<00:00:20.060> crystals<00:00:20.510> today<00:00:20.750> for

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
went to pick up some crystals today for

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.759 
went to pick up some crystals today for
my<00:00:21.080> supplier<00:00:21.530> and<00:00:21.890> these<00:00:22.670> were<00:00:22.939> there<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:23.769> we

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
my supplier and these were there and we

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.660 
my supplier and these were there and we
actually<00:00:25.160> sat<00:00:25.400> down<00:00:25.429> and<00:00:25.849> marked<00:00:26.179> out<00:00:26.589> the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
actually sat down and marked out the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.310 
actually sat down and marked out the
bubbles<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:28.939> in<00:00:29.390> hydros<00:00:29.779> for<00:00:29.960> those<00:00:30.080> of<00:00:30.230> you

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
bubbles and in hydros for those of you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.690 
bubbles and in hydros for those of you
that<00:00:30.470> don't<00:00:30.619> know<00:00:30.769> are<00:00:31.870> clear<00:00:32.870> crystals

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
that don't know are clear crystals

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.890 
that don't know are clear crystals
doesn't<00:00:34.700> have<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.850> be<00:00:34.940> clear<00:00:35.150> crystal<00:00:35.540> quartz

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
doesn't have to be clear crystal quartz

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.550 
doesn't have to be clear crystal quartz
but<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:36.860> have<00:00:37.010> bubbles<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.670> water<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:39.140> are

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
but they have bubbles of water that are

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.780 
but they have bubbles of water that are
eons<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.460> eons<00:00:40.960> years<00:00:41.960> old<00:00:42.320> from<00:00:42.980> when<00:00:43.430> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
eons and eons years old from when the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.000 
eons and eons years old from when the
crystal<00:00:44.240> formed<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.870> trapped<00:00:45.260> some<00:00:45.530> water<00:00:45.770> in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
crystal formed it trapped some water in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.320 
crystal formed it trapped some water in
there<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.400> so<00:00:46.580> there's<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.820> little<00:00:47.030> trapped

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
there and so there's a little trapped

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.990 
there and so there's a little trapped
bubble<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.990> water<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.130> sometimes<00:00:49.640> that

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
bubble of water and sometimes that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.390 
bubble of water and sometimes that
bubble<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.360> water<00:00:50.570> holds<00:00:51.110> little<00:00:51.350> specks<00:00:52.250> of

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
bubble of water holds little specks of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000 
bubble of water holds little specks of
impurities<00:00:53.000> like<00:00:53.240> carbon<00:00:53.780> or<00:00:54.140> some<00:00:54.740> kind<00:00:54.950> of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
impurities like carbon or some kind of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.970 
impurities like carbon or some kind of
petroleum<00:00:55.640> from<00:00:56.060> tar<00:00:56.780> pits<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.320> existed<00:00:57.890> in

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
petroleum from tar pits that existed in

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.240 
petroleum from tar pits that existed in
the<00:00:58.040> area<00:00:59.350> you<00:01:00.350> know<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.500> little<00:01:00.650> piece<00:01:00.830> of<00:01:01.040> dirt

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
the area you know a little piece of dirt

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.950 
the area you know a little piece of dirt
a<00:01:01.640> little<00:01:02.060> bit<00:01:02.450> of<00:01:02.600> plant<00:01:02.900> oil<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.720> water

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
a little bit of plant oil and the water

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.270 
a little bit of plant oil and the water
gets<00:01:06.290> trapped<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.799> sometimes<00:01:07.130> it's

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
gets trapped and sometimes it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.850 
gets trapped and sometimes it's
completely<00:01:07.970> pure<00:01:08.360> those<00:01:09.110> are<00:01:09.259> even<00:01:09.470> harder<00:01:09.650> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
completely pure those are even harder to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.220 
completely pure those are even harder to
find<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.270> when<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.510> move<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.840> crystal

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
find and so when you move the crystal

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.680 
find and so when you move the crystal
around<00:01:12.350> you'll<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.130> bubble<00:01:13.610> show<00:01:14.300> up<00:01:14.480> a

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
around you'll see a bubble show up a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.040 
around you'll see a bubble show up a
bubble<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.200> water<00:01:15.470> show<00:01:15.860> up<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.310> an<00:01:17.180> hydros

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
bubble of water show up and an hydros

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.280 
bubble of water show up and an hydros
are<00:01:18.410> really<00:01:18.950> highly<00:01:19.280> sought<00:01:19.550> after<00:01:19.580> because

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
are really highly sought after because

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.070 
are really highly sought after because
they're<00:01:21.290> known<00:01:21.620> to<00:01:21.650> be<00:01:21.830> very<00:01:22.100> cleansing<00:01:22.850> and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
they're known to be very cleansing and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080 
they're known to be very cleansing and
purifying<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:24.770> they're<00:01:25.250> really<00:01:25.550> really<00:01:25.670> good

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
purifying so they're really really good

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.030 
purifying so they're really really good
as<00:01:26.270> healers<00:01:26.900> they're<00:01:27.200> kind<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.860> with<00:01:27.980> the

you<00:02:32.659> take<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.140> tetrahedrons<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.219> you<00:02:34.760> embed

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
you take to tetrahedrons and you embed

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.589 
you take to tetrahedrons and you embed
one<00:02:35.269> into<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.599> other<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.590> Merkabah

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
one into the other you get the Merkabah

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.330 
one into the other you get the Merkabah
also<00:02:38.599> known<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.170> Star<00:02:39.439> of<00:02:39.469> David

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.930 

which<00:02:44.000> means<00:02:44.470> Merkava<00:02:45.470> means<00:02:45.680> light<00:02:46.640> body

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
which means Merkava means light body

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.900 
which means Merkava means light body
spirit<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.620> powerful<00:02:51.950> to

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
spirit so really just so powerful to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.670 
spirit so really just so powerful to
work<00:02:53.090> with<00:02:53.300> these<00:02:53.480> okay<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.380> don't<00:02:54.440> know

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
work with these okay and I don't know

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.170 
work with these okay and I don't know
I'm<00:02:54.770> gonna<00:02:54.890> try<00:02:55.190> I'm<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.940> try<00:02:56.150> really

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
I'm gonna try I'm going to try really

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.780 
I'm gonna try I'm going to try really
really<00:02:56.480> hard<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:57.080> see<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.770> see<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
really hard to see if you can see the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.780 
really hard to see if you can see the
bubbles<00:02:59.739> what<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.769> did<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.099> we<00:03:01.250> mark<00:03:01.519> them<00:03:01.670> with

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
bubbles what I did was we mark them with

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.460 
bubbles what I did was we mark them with
a<00:03:01.819> square<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.330> don't<00:03:02.720> know<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.110> see<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
a square I don't know if you can see the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.890 
a square I don't know if you can see the
little<00:03:03.709> black<00:03:03.980> speck<00:03:04.519> this<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:04.970> has<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> speck

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
little black speck this one has a speck

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.759 
little black speck this one has a speck
going<00:03:06.349> up<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.769> down<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.489> went<00:03:07.819> up<00:03:08.769> I'll

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
going up and down it just went up I'll

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.979 
going up and down it just went up I'll
probably<00:03:10.010> turn<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.519> upside<00:03:10.819> down<00:03:10.849> up<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.720> then

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
probably turn it upside down up and then

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.460 
probably turn it upside down up and then
it<00:03:12.110> went<00:03:12.230> up<00:03:12.349> can<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.190> see<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.760> oh<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.780> hope

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it went up can you see that oh I hope

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.350 
it went up can you see that oh I hope
you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.830> it's<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.340> hard<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.580> capture<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:17.209> video

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
you can it's so hard to capture on video

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080 
you can it's so hard to capture on video
because<00:03:17.690> these<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.670> if<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.880> put<00:03:20.060> a

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because these and then if you put a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.229 
because these and then if you put a
magnifying<00:03:20.600> glass<00:03:21.049> up<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:23.030> can

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
magnifying glass up to this you can

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.380 
magnifying glass up to this you can
really<00:03:23.750> just<00:03:24.019> go<00:03:25.010> wild<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:25.670> looking<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.150> these

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
really just go wild but looking in these

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.330 
really just go wild but looking in these
and<00:03:26.690> seeing<00:03:26.959> these<00:03:27.140> here's<00:03:27.500> another<00:03:27.769> one<00:03:28.069> in

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
and seeing these here's another one in

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.190 
and seeing these here's another one in
this<00:03:28.610> little<00:03:28.880> square<00:03:29.480> here<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:29.930> you're

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
this little square here and you're

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.509 
this little square here and you're
probably<00:03:30.349> not<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.069> able<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.280> see

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
probably not going to be able to see

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.289 
probably not going to be able to see
that<00:03:31.730> one<00:03:32.680> okay<00:03:33.680> by<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.430> way<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.970> also

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
that one okay by the way this is also

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.050 
that one okay by the way this is also
double<00:03:35.660> terminated<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:36.890> again<00:03:37.430> makes<00:03:37.790> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
double terminated which again makes it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.600 
double terminated which again makes it
another<00:03:38.780> great<00:03:39.049> tool<00:03:39.319> for<00:03:39.620> healing<00:03:39.799> double

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
another great tool for healing double

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.960 
another great tool for healing double
terminated<00:03:41.170> crystals<00:03:42.170> allow<00:03:42.650> energy<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.730> flow

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
terminated crystals allow energy to flow

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.449 
terminated crystals allow energy to flow
in<00:03:44.209> both<00:03:44.480> directions<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.560> both<00:03:45.799> for<00:03:46.040> clearing

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
in both directions so both for clearing

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.599 
in both directions so both for clearing
out<00:03:47.170> toxicities<00:03:48.170> or<00:03:48.440> things<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.130> don't<00:03:49.280> want

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
out toxicities or things you don't want

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.430 
out toxicities or things you don't want
and<00:03:49.850> then<00:03:50.120> bringing<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.959> flow<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.200> energy

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
and then bringing in the flow of energy

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.380 
and then bringing in the flow of energy
that<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.130> want<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:54.250> has<00:03:55.390> bubbles

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that you do want this one has bubbles

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.729 
that you do want this one has bubbles
everywhere<00:03:56.660> every<00:03:57.140> found<00:03:57.410> one<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:59.739> another
