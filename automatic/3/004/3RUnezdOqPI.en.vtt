00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.770 
tee in the 3300 all the time because
instead<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:11.070> cage<00:04:11.370> I've<00:04:11.790> got<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.420> vertical

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
instead of a cage I've got a vertical

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.530 
instead of a cage I've got a vertical
harddrive<00:04:13.500> stack<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:14.459> fits<00:04:14.760> three<00:04:15.120> two<00:04:15.390> and

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
harddrive stack that fits three two and

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.750 
harddrive stack that fits three two and
a<00:04:15.570> half<00:04:15.720> inch<00:04:15.959> drives<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.620> three<00:04:17.040> three<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:17.669> a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
a half inch drives and three three and a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.550 
a half inch drives and three three and a
half<00:04:17.910> inch<00:04:18.120> drives<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:18.930> basically<00:04:19.290> you've<00:04:19.530> got

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
half inch drives so basically you've got

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.039 
half inch drives so basically you've got
stacks<00:04:20.010> on<00:04:20.220> stacks<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.730> storage<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.359> just

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
stacks on stacks of storage and just

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.900 
stacks on stacks of storage and just
like<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.289> 3500<00:04:22.979> s<00:04:23.039> drive<00:04:23.310> cage<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.880> can

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
like the 3500 s drive cage you can

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.600 
like the 3500 s drive cage you can
remove<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.660> vertical<00:04:25.020> stack<00:04:25.250> by<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.490> taking

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
remove the vertical stack by just taking

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.709 
remove the vertical stack by just taking
out<00:04:26.820> three<00:04:26.940> thumbs

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:27.719 
out three thumbs

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.619

but<00:04:28.259> keep<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.919> mind<00:04:28.949> if<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.729> have<00:04:30.060> stacks

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
but keep in mind if you do have stacks

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.390 
but keep in mind if you do have stacks
and<00:04:30.780> stacks<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.169> hard<00:04:31.379> drives<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:31.889> the
