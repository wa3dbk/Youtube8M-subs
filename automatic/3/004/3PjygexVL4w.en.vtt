some interviews in a video that a friend
asked<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.600> invented<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.649> called

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
asked for so I invented this it's called

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
asked for so I invented this it's called
infinity<00:00:42.149> Steadicam<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.200> called<00:00:43.410> infinity

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
infinity Steadicam it's called infinity

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.029 
infinity Steadicam it's called infinity
because<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.610> an<00:00:44.910> infinite<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:46.200> infinite

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because it has an infinite in infinite

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.569 
because it has an infinite in infinite

you see it in the video then just glue

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.819

the<00:01:29.670> parts<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.270> marked<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.659> red

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
the parts that are marked with red

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
the parts that are marked with red
together<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.130> push<00:01:32.850> together<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.689> ones<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
together and push together the ones that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
together and push together the ones that
are<00:01:34.170> marked<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.530> blue<00:01:35.030> finally<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.210> painted

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
are marked with blue finally I painted

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
are marked with blue finally I painted
it<00:01:36.990> twice<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.189> gets<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> thicker<00:01:38.790> layer<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it twice so it gets a thicker layer of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.620 
it twice so it gets a thicker layer of
paint<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.320> looks<00:01:40.560> much<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:41.159> better<00:01:41.630> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
paint and it looks much much better to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
paint and it looks much much better to
add<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:43.049> details<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.710> used<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.340> old<00:01:44.490> monopod
