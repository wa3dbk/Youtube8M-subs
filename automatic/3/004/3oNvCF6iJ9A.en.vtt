00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.260 
and the first thing that I would say
about<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> game<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.789> definitely

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
about this game is that it definitely

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
about this game is that it definitely
feels<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> halo<00:00:49.469> game<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> plays<00:00:50.190> very

feels like a halo game it plays very

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
feels like a halo game it plays very
much<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.719> halo<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.260> someone<00:00:53.070> that's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
much like a halo game someone that's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
coming from halo 3 or halo reach would

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
bunch of multi kills and it was just a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.469 
bunch of multi kills and it was just a
really<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.960> easy<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.220> pick<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.460> game<00:01:08.970> while

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
really really easy to pick up game while

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.580 
really really easy to pick up game while
there<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.720> definitely<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.110> things<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
there were definitely some things that I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
there were definitely some things that I
didn't<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.070> right<00:01:11.310> away<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> the

in my opinion one of the comments that I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.789 
in my opinion one of the comments that I
recall<00:02:02.219> an<00:02:02.640> MLG<00:02:02.969> Pro<00:02:03.479> making<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.439> Halo

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
recall an MLG Pro making about Halo

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
recall an MLG Pro making about Halo
Reach<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.579> sprint<00:02:06.210> screws<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> game

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
Reach is that sprint screws up the game

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.900 
Reach is that sprint screws up the game
like<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.560> you've<00:02:07.680> got<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> perfect<00:02:08.459> kill<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
like if you've got a perfect kill and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
like if you've got a perfect kill and
you<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.179> play<00:02:09.450> someone<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you out play someone they can just

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.440 
you out play someone they can just
sprint<00:02:11.220> away<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.640> let<00:02:11.849> their<00:02:12.060> shields

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
sprint away and let their shields

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.580 
sprint away and let their shields
recharge<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.989> then<00:02:13.110> come<00:02:13.290> back

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
recharge and then come back

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
recharge and then come back
you<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.940> can't<00:02:15.360> account

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you I think that if you can't account

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
you I think that if you can't account
for<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.050> fact<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.379> people<00:02:16.709> are<00:02:16.920> able<00:02:16.980> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
for the fact that people are able to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.100 
for the fact that people are able to
sprint<00:02:17.670> away<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.150> isn't<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> failure<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
sprint away that isn't a failure of the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.309 
sprint away that isn't a failure of the
game<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.280> favor<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.390> adapt<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
like in call of duty I feel like the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
like in call of duty I feel like the
only<00:02:37.440> impact<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.160> has<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.849> game<00:02:39.090> or

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
only impact that this has on the game or

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.210 
only impact that this has on the game or
had<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> games<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.379> I<00:02:40.470> played<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.069> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
had on the games that I played is that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.970 
had on the games that I played is that
it<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.610> much<00:02:42.060> faster<00:02:42.480> paced<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.290> despite

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
it was a much faster paced and despite

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.650 
it was a much faster paced and despite
the<00:02:44.340> maps<00:02:44.580> being<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.910> little<00:02:45.060> bigger<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
the maps being a little bigger I think I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.420 
the maps being a little bigger I think I
bet<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> map<00:02:46.110> called<00:02:46.319> solace<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.250> felt

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bet on a map called solace and I felt

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.880 
bet on a map called solace and I felt
was<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.970> big<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.420> 4v4<00:02:49.079> much<00:02:49.319> but

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
was a little big for a 4v4 much but

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.890 
was a little big for a 4v4 much but
sprint<00:02:50.280> definitely<00:02:50.819> helped<00:02:51.150> close<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.690> gap

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
sprint definitely helped close that gap

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600 
sprint definitely helped close that gap
much<00:02:52.200> quicker<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.860> didn't<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.280> make

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
much quicker and it didn't really make

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.819 
much quicker and it didn't really make
it<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:54.030> bitchfest<00:02:55.019> where<00:02:55.260> everyone<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:55.769> just

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
it a bitchfest where everyone would just

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.650 
it a bitchfest where everyone would just
peg<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.519> away<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> second<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.480> they<00:02:57.599> were

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
peg it away the second that they were

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.259 
peg it away the second that they were
almost<00:02:57.810> dead<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.430> generally<00:02:59.430> sprint<00:02:59.879> was<00:03:00.030> used

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
almost dead it generally sprint was used

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.600 
almost dead it generally sprint was used

crap<00:03:03.180> around<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.569> map<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.440> was<00:03:04.620> too

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
crap around the map then it was too

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.039 
that but it's the big ass cannon thing
that<00:03:21.690> shoots<00:03:21.959> out<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.319> red<00:03:23.150> explosive<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.359> then

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that shoots out a red explosive and then

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.530 
that shoots out a red explosive and then

on full shields norm really seemed to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.129 
on full shields norm really seemed to
play<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.880> game<00:04:40.090> as<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:40.419> they<00:04:40.570> were<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.720> halo

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.110 
play the game as if they were a halo
player<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.919> maybe<00:04:42.160> we<00:04:42.310> were<00:04:42.460> playing<00:04:42.699> with<00:04:42.850> a

people<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.430> yeah<00:05:03.849> I<00:05:03.880> really<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:04.360> have<00:05:04.539> many

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
people and yeah I really don't have many

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.450 
people and yeah I really don't have many
bad<00:05:04.930> things<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.289> say<00:05:05.380> about<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.009> new<00:05:06.160> guns

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
bad things to say about the new guns

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.689 
bad things to say about the new guns
they<00:05:06.820> seem<00:05:07.210> really<00:05:08.050> cool<00:05:08.470> just<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:09.039> really<00:05:09.550> nice

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
they seem really cool just a really nice

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.640 
they seem really cool just a really nice
addition<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.180> halo<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.259> is<00:05:11.380> one<00:05:11.500> thing

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
addition to halo and that is one thing

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.230 
addition to halo and that is one thing
that<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.830> would<00:05:11.889> say<00:05:12.070> overall<00:05:12.669> is<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.120> this

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
that I would say overall is that this

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.810 
that I would say overall is that this
game<00:05:13.449> seems<00:05:13.690> very<00:05:13.900> different<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.590> Halo<00:05:15.340> 3<00:05:15.370> or

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
game seems very different to Halo 3 or

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.629 
game seems very different to Halo 3 or
halo<00:05:16.090> reach<00:05:16.330> but<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:16.960> definitely<00:05:17.139> seems

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
halo reach but it definitely seems

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.969 
halo reach but it definitely seems
better<00:05:18.840> maybe<00:05:19.840> not<00:05:20.050> then<00:05:20.169> halo<00:05:20.349> 3<00:05:20.800> but

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
better maybe not then halo 3 but

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.770 
better maybe not then halo 3 but
definitely<00:05:21.250> than<00:05:21.370> halo<00:05:21.580> reach<00:05:21.940> based<00:05:22.509> on<00:05:22.630> this

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
definitely than halo reach based on this

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.260 
definitely than halo reach based on this
very<00:05:23.139> very<00:05:23.410> brief<00:05:23.919> playing<00:05:24.699> period<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.240> I

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
very very brief playing period that I

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.779 
very very brief playing period that I
have<00:05:25.539> I<00:05:25.780> have<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.710> say<00:05:26.889> that<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.340> probably

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
have I have to say that I probably

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.850 
have I have to say that I probably
enjoyed<00:05:28.479> it<00:05:28.630> more<00:05:28.810> than<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.050> think<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:29.620> would

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
enjoyed it more than I think I would

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.500 
enjoyed it more than I think I would
halo<00:05:30.130> reach<00:05:30.400> I've<00:05:30.639> played<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.909> lot<00:05:31.030> of<00:05:31.240> halo

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
halo reach I've played a lot of halo

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.939 
halo reach I've played a lot of halo
reach<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:31.990> maybe<00:05:32.440> I've<00:05:32.560> got<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.740> better

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
reach and maybe I've got a better

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.950 
reach and maybe I've got a better
impression<00:05:33.370> of<00:05:33.729> halo<00:05:34.000> reach<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.510> I<00:05:34.720> don't

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
impression of halo reach and I don't

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.770 
impression of halo reach and I don't
enjoy<00:05:35.139> it<00:05:35.409> as<00:05:35.500> much<00:05:35.530> but<00:05:36.310> halo<00:05:36.729> 4<00:05:37.120> from<00:05:37.570> the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
enjoy it as much but halo 4 from the

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.890 
enjoy it as much but halo 4 from the
like<00:05:38.349> I<00:05:38.500> said<00:05:38.740> very<00:05:39.159> very<00:05:39.430> brief<00:05:39.789> time<00:05:40.150> I

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
like I said very very brief time I

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.170 
like I said very very brief time I
played<00:05:41.229> it<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.650> definitely<00:05:42.130> enjoyed<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:43.000> more

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
played it I definitely enjoyed it more

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.670 
played it I definitely enjoyed it more
maybe<00:05:43.449> it's<00:05:43.659> just<00:05:43.690> because<00:05:43.900> it's<00:05:44.050> different<00:05:44.560> I

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
maybe it's just because it's different I

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.050 
maybe it's just because it's different I
don't<00:05:44.979> really<00:05:45.130> want<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.460> seem<00:05:45.639> as<00:05:45.789> if<00:05:45.909> I'm

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
don't really want to seem as if I'm

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.110 
don't really want to seem as if I'm
making<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.570> bunch<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:46.990> irrational<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:48.120> very

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
making a bunch of irrational and very

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.570 
making a bunch of irrational and very
judgmental<00:05:49.840> comments<00:05:50.050> at<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.830> first<00:05:51.220> taste

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
judgmental comments at the first taste

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.730 
judgmental comments at the first taste
of<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:51.820> I<00:05:51.880> gave<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.330> game<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:53.050> was<00:05:53.169> very<00:05:53.229> fun

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
of that I gave the game it was very fun

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.189 
of that I gave the game it was very fun
to<00:05:53.919> play<00:05:54.099> for<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.550> very<00:05:54.760> few<00:05:55.330> games<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:55.810> played

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199
