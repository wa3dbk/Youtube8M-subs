open the unit there's a thumb screw at
the<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.820> get<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:48.000> twist<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> then

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the back just get better twist and then

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
the back just get better twist and then
I<00:00:49.770> did<00:00:50.010> search<00:00:50.280> everywhere<00:00:50.730> trying<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> open

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
I did search everywhere trying to open

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
I did search everywhere trying to open
this<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.780> pulling<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.469> pushing<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
this I was pulling it and pushing it

this I was pulling it and pushing it
everywhere<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.570> but<00:00:54.570> he<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.809> quite<00:00:55.140> easy<00:00:55.350> once

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
everywhere and but he is quite easy once

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
everywhere and but he is quite easy once
you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.059> another<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.600> I'm

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you know the another way to do it I'm

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
you know the another way to do it I'm
going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.590> hand<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.039> pulling

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
going to do it with one hand and pulling

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
going to do it with one hand and pulling
it<00:00:59.699> all<00:01:00.120> spaced<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.629> rubber<00:01:00.899> feet<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> kind

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it all spaced up rubber feet so it kind

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
it all spaced up rubber feet so it kind
of<00:01:01.739> sticks<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.359> press<00:01:03.570> down

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
of sticks quite well so just press down

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
of sticks quite well so just press down
and<00:01:04.110> pull<00:01:04.170> forward<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> top<00:01:05.850> comes

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and pull forward and then the top comes

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
and pull forward and then the top comes
off<00:01:08.119> remove<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.979> underneath<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> cover<00:01:11.610> we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
off remove that underneath the cover we

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
off remove that underneath the cover we
can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.590> we've<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.010> half<00:01:14.070> inch

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
can see we've got a two and half inch

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.690 
can see we've got a two and half inch
hard<00:01:14.580> drive<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:16.100> heat<00:01:17.100> sink<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
hard drive and here heat sink for the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
hard drive and here heat sink for the
processor<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:21.570> need<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.950> need

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
processor and we need to take a we need

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
processor and we need to take a we need
to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> memory<00:01:23.729> upgrades<00:01:24.030> locate<00:01:24.570> just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to do a memory upgrades locate just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.330 
to do a memory upgrades locate just
underneath<00:01:25.140> those<00:01:25.439> hard<00:01:25.650> drive<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> was

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
underneath those hard drive so it was

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.660 
underneath those hard drive so it was
really<00:01:26.549> easy<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> find<00:01:27.530> well<00:01:28.530> hard<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> find<00:01:29.520> if

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
really easy to find well hard to find if

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.800 
really easy to find well hard to find if
you<00:01:29.729> don't<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.600> that's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you don't know where it is but that's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
you don't know where it is but that's
easy<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> come<00:01:32.909> a
