month and it is a new video and I just

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.179 
month and it is a new video and I just
wanted<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.439> time<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
wanted to have a lot of time to do it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
wanted to have a lot of time to do it
because<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:21.240> seemed<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
because it seemed like it was going to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.870 
because it seemed like it was going to
be<00:00:22.230> something<00:00:22.350> that's<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> while

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
be something that's gonna take a while

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.000 
be something that's gonna take a while
