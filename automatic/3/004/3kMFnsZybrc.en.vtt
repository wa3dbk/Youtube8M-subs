the Internet

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.400 
the Internet
of<00:00:37.129> somebody<00:00:37.670> doing<00:00:37.970> stretches<00:00:38.780> with<00:00:39.050> hind

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
legs that were just completely what I

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.210 
legs that were just completely what I
thought<00:00:42.860> very<00:00:43.360> unsafe<00:00:44.769> they<00:00:45.769> were<00:00:45.830> standing

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
thought very unsafe they were standing

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.340 
thought very unsafe they were standing
directly<00:00:46.610> behind<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.540> horse<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:50.350> pulling

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
directly behind the horse and pulling

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.049 
directly behind the horse and pulling
the<00:00:51.559> hind<00:00:51.800> leg<00:00:52.070> towards<00:00:52.550> them<00:00:52.820> like<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:53.390> and

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
the hind leg towards them like this and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.790 
the hind leg towards them like this and
if<00:00:56.059> that<00:00:56.360> horse<00:00:56.629> decided<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.410> didn't<00:00:57.649> like

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
if that horse decided it didn't like

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.220 
if that horse decided it didn't like
that<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.760> person<00:00:59.239> would<00:00:59.420> have<00:00:59.450> got<00:00:59.719> a<00:00:59.750> full

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
face full of hoof and could have easily

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.380 
face full of hoof and could have easily
died<00:01:03.140> or<00:01:03.469> just<00:01:03.829> ended<00:01:04.100> up<00:01:04.190> in<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.460> hospital<00:01:04.580> at

stretches for your hind legs
what<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> best<00:01:12.800> position<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.340> do<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.850> for

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
what is the best position to do that for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.060

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.340 

basically<00:01:28.760> you<00:01:28.880> want<00:01:29.120> your<00:01:29.360> horse<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.720> see

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350

basically you want your horse to see
where<00:01:30.710> you're<00:01:30.950> at<00:01:31.130> at<00:01:31.400> all<00:01:31.580> times<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:32.180> know

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
that you're there so I always want to

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
have my hand you know kind of on him and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.540 
have my hand you know kind of on him and
be<00:01:37.640> close<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.510> horse<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.560> he<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:40.370> he

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
be close to the horse so he if he

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.360 
be close to the horse so he if he
decided<00:01:40.940> he<00:01:41.210> was<00:01:41.240> gonna<00:01:41.570> kick<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.290> wouldn't<00:01:43.220> get

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
decided he was gonna kick I wouldn't get

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.460 
decided he was gonna kick I wouldn't get
the<00:01:43.580> full<00:01:43.790> force<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.480> it<00:01:44.960> would<00:01:45.110> be<00:01:45.260> more

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the full force of that it would be more

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.230 
the full force of that it would be more
likely<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:46.130> push<00:01:46.460> me<00:01:46.670> away

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
likely to just push me away

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.480 
likely to just push me away
or<00:01:47.510> do<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> glancing<00:01:48.350> blow<00:01:48.440> he<00:01:48.800> can't<00:01:49.040> get<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
or do a glancing blow he can't get the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.150 
or do a glancing blow he can't get the
full<00:01:49.730> power<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.510> kick<00:01:50.950> if<00:01:51.950> you're

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
full power of the kick if you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.130 
full power of the kick if you're
enclosed<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.880> further<00:01:53.150> away<00:01:53.480> you<00:01:53.510> are<00:01:53.690> the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
enclosed the further away you are the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.590 
enclosed the further away you are the
harder<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.680> hoof<00:01:54.980> can<00:01:55.280> land<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.330> make<00:01:56.570> sure

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
harder that hoof can land so make sure

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.470 
harder that hoof can land so make sure
that<00:01:56.810> you're<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.350> close<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.950> body<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.610> let

out<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.480> way<00:03:14.660> instead<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:16.220> smacking

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
out of the way instead of just smacking

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
I've noticed is very helpful in relaxing

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.530 
I've noticed is very helpful in relaxing
them<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.380> just<00:03:30.410> take<00:03:30.829> my<00:03:31.160> hand<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:32.209> thumb

and just rub in the back of the pasture
and<00:03:38.090> for<00:03:38.360> some<00:03:38.600> reason<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.920> gets<00:03:40.220> them<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.610> just

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
and for some reason it gets them to just

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.960 
and for some reason it gets them to just
kind<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.150> relax<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.810> leg<00:03:42.610> it's<00:03:43.610> they're<00:03:43.790> just

to do the stretch it's more effective to
do<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.910> stretch<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.419> way<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:14.160> horse

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
do the stretch that way and the horse

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.170 
do the stretch that way and the horse
just<00:05:16.229> they<00:05:16.500> they<00:05:16.979> pick<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.729> what<00:05:18.030> you're

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
trying to do they know that you're

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.920 
trying to do they know that you're
supporting<00:05:19.919> them<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:21.240> think<00:05:21.539> it<00:05:21.690> just

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
supporting them and I think it just

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.420 
supporting them and I think it just
makes<00:05:22.139> them<00:05:22.410> feel<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.800> little<00:05:22.979> bit<00:05:23.190> more

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
makes them feel a little bit more

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.680 
makes them feel a little bit more
comfortable<00:05:23.820> with<00:05:23.970> how<00:05:24.270> you're<00:05:24.510> handling
