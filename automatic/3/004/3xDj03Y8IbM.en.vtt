00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.680
 so good day to everything 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.150
 so today we find ourselves for 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.500
 a new video is then today 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.430
 this will be the review of the word you know long 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.380
 So that is the new model 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.310
 I posted a blind man I'm not there 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.860
 long time it was 10 60 with a pretty 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 7.77 single skip and that's so I 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.800
 thought it would be cool to do the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.080
 review of this cube which is frankly 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.879
 montcuq preferred at the well not 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the sensation of the cube of the feeling of 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 feeling a little bit all this surely 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 cube that I like me so simply 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 because in fact the first time when 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.290
 I get out of the box I really 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.980
 found really disappointing compared to 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.170
 what they told me 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.219
 compared that I saw felix who is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.470
 even redo a review on it 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 because for list is really 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.530
 better than my and / or expected 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 really a good thing eventually I was 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.830
 disappointed but afterwards actually it is as 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.410
 as we use 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.270
 it gets better and better I'm hungry 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.390
 I for me that made me that actually frozen 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.439
 lubricated I cleaned up I had broken proud 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 I adapted 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.640
 I adapt and tensions for for my 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 bing cube style is frankly 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.130
 since bass has really become a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 super club 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 here we are the young people 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 use a lot so the stickers have 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 already started a little bit to sabine and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.130
 even if the moe ue stickers are when 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 even really well actually these cubes the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 problem is that it actually has a 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 excellent by marketing can see in 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.600
 square 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 sometimes pays also pays here 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 but that's what they need to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.430
 still marketing like that they have 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.460
 used holes that are still 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.600
 really big sailboats she is too 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 for the marketing camp are still 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 big share compared to g no we'll say a 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.470
 girl or the holes are still 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.140
 relatively small con paria let's see that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.550
 does that when I shine her cube son 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 the ubf anyway for me by 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.670
 really fast 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.170
 ie I lubricates I'm a 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.640
 surrender of 100 soldiers after I have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.290
 really their free and proud even can 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.340
 to be not even 100 saulve 50 balance of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 time so that's what it's worth noting so 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.269
 must often cleaned too I have some game 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.870
 clean them very often this one 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.750
 since I had 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.670
 here is listening to the noise a frankly one 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.130
 really feels like it's all 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.530
 simple what's that yeah that's it 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.970
 it's a cube that suits people 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.930
 who leave bourrine not but at the same 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.380
 time it's a cube that allows to have 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.040
 a really rather really high time 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.570
 what is to say without noise then is 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.790
 really fast movements 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.920
 so I would say problem is that 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.510
 time finally what he would rather go for 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.090
 people at a level already a little 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.310
 advanced ie for someone who has 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.109
 30 40 seconds which will not make him 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.940
 really gain more time than if 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.389
 this person takes a girl or 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.590
 one even a franck fife to which at 30 40 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.030
 seconds better take a frenchie 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.069
 cheap birds to it will be a cube 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 who will not be one who will be more stable 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.870
 because this one is not necessarily 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.910
 stable 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.400
 it's stable when we took when we 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.829
 adapt I would say when we acquired a 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.069
 mature a mature finger tricks 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.769
 and es22 cubin whatever it is for 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.359
 avoid lock up this because otherwise 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.130
 here otherwise it will not necessarily be more 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.840
 fast but he was shooting for people 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.040
 from about 8 to 15 seconds 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.900
 I am about 10 to us in this 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.709
 moment here it is a cube that me 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.750
 at least for me 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.640
 perfectly 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.050
 that's after of course it's relatively 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.230
 are some people who will not like this 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.020
 cube because they will find it and the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.420
 second I do not know maybe too fast 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.490
 or else it is not necessarily fast and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.100
 me as fast as one because yes we kill 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.570
 but no doubt that underwater but 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.070
 they may find it I do not know 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.720
 will not be their style which is because 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.640
 every cubic hour to his cubic style 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.810
 and that for nothing to do that is why 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.180
 that I do not really have that you tell him 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.400
 tell you if it's the cube to buy and 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 who will really make you win I take 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.290
 really won 4 seconds finally who you 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.810
 will really make money but that's 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:38.440
 why for me it's really expensive 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:42.460
 of the world otherwise we sometimes see them pop 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.280
 quite often that is to say me there is 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.700
 it's still enough to loosen mine 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.490
 but pop 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.290
 yeah I 'll say is maybe on the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.850
 vg sense and hip hop pop is 2.3 times 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.550
 that we are the only concern that I 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.110
 would say that she comes that which is 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.600
 really a shame he does a lot of 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.370
 corners twist and that's really 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.880
 boring kind even when we mix 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.590
 in the cube 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.880
 I make swiss corners of the coup I 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.060
 can not put them because I did 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.470
 not seen it already called me several of 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.940
 snow times in my life I have a hundred of 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.430
 cost at a time I count them more than 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.229
 I find it really con suddenly here 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.919
 even that even congratulates the poor he 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.690
 had he had a world records and with 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.160
 what he had a little when their twist 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:30.180
 of the cost of his fiction or even would like 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.770
 not even count so brief here's where 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.970
 really it's the only big defect that 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 I can him that I can give him but 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.560
 good we do with and that's what it is not 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.500
 it's also not very very serious because 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.020
 that it's not often so it's actually 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.050
 so to conclude I would say that this cube 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.310
 and tincu very fast and it takes but 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.069
 that if we really want to exploit his 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.900
 abilities to the max it does not really need 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.819
 do not have that beginner butter I would say a 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.580
 beginner thriller will not find that 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.840
 this cube say that all the others are 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.860
 I can not really tell you 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.719
 if the cube will become your email 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.580
 but what I can tell you is that 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:16.210
 chances are because there's really 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:18.460
 well and is that here is past it's a 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.909
 great but in any case for me 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.270
 was often to lubricate here is there 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:27.250
 had that an internet consoles I you 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.750
 ask no sales I have already posted a 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:41.699
 admission reis so I invite you to the 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:41.699
 look to the last 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:56.810
 and here on good bah plays say 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.990
 see all of a good day in 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.990
 soon
