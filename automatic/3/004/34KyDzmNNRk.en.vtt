00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
super steels so this time we chose to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
super steels so this time we chose to
use<00:01:30.390> CPM<00:01:31.170> 154<00:01:32.070> CPM<00:01:33.000> 154<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> powdered<00:01:34.530> metal

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
use CPM 154 CPM 154 is a powdered metal

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.819 
use CPM 154 CPM 154 is a powdered metal
it<00:01:35.490> has<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:36.180> fine<00:01:36.240> grain<00:01:36.600> structure<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it has a very fine grain structure and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940 
it has a very fine grain structure and
what<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> means<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.170> makes<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
what that means is that it makes this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.760 
what that means is that it makes this
knife<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:42.119> easy<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.570> sharpen<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
knife really easy to sharpen and it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190 
knife really easy to sharpen and it
makes<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> blade<00:01:44.399> very<00:01:44.790> tough<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.570> toughness

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
makes the blade very tough now toughness

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.249 
makes the blade very tough now toughness
is<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.829> important<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.360> pocket

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
is really important in a in a pocket

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
is really important in a in a pocket
knife<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.280> has<00:01:50.759> such<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> thin<00:01:51.390> blade

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
