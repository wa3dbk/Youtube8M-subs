00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
get in there with my really clean hands
and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.740> start<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> break<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.729> kale<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and I start to break down the kale so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.789 
and I start to break down the kale so
you're<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.840> tearing<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.649> little

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
you're just tearing it into little

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.730 
you're just tearing it into little
pieces<00:01:53.299> this<00:01:54.299> makes<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.720> easier<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.500> digest

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
pieces this makes it easier to digest

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
pieces this makes it easier to digest
smaller<00:01:56.460> pieces<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.000> kale<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.710> also

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
smaller pieces of kale and then also

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
smaller pieces of kale and then also
like<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> said<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.520> tender

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
like I said a tender

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.370 
like I said a tender
it's<00:02:00.800> really<00:02:01.070> really<00:02:01.310> dense<00:02:01.700> thick<00:02:02.480> grain<00:02:02.840> so

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
it's really really dense thick grain so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.020 
it's really really dense thick grain so
it<00:02:03.470> needs<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.860> tenderized<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.640> little<00:02:04.880> bit

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
it needs to be tenderized a little bit

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.960 
it needs to be tenderized a little bit
to<00:02:05.210> make<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.420> nice<00:02:05.690> tasty<00:02:06.260> salad<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.790> whole

to make a nice tasty salad so this whole

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.359 
to make a nice tasty salad so this whole
process<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.450> takes<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.990> couple<00:02:09.020> minutes<00:02:09.369> I

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
process just takes a couple minutes I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
almost like a thick dressing so we don't

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.840 
almost like a thick dressing so we don't
even<00:03:53.930> need<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.380> add<00:03:54.620> any<00:03:54.890> oil<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.489> dressing
