pancake<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.660> not<00:02:15.810> do<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> just

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
pancake if you do not do this it just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.470 
pancake if you do not do this it just
gives<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.230> little<00:02:19.350> bit<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.620> flavor<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
gives it a little bit more flavor and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.590 
gives it a little bit more flavor and
put<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.630> medium-high<00:02:25.530> temperature<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.420> put

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
put on medium-high temperature so we put

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.050 
put on medium-high temperature so we put
on<00:02:27.720> five<00:02:28.040> don't<00:02:29.040> spray<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> pan<00:02:29.880> like

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
on five don't spray it off the pan like

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.330 
on five don't spray it off the pan like
I<00:02:30.209> usually<00:02:30.390> do

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
I usually do

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:42.490 
I usually do
and<00:02:32.720> porce<00:02:33.720> them<00:02:33.930> onto<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.340> pan<00:02:37.190> okay<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and porce them onto the pan okay and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.930 
and porce them onto the pan okay and
just<00:02:43.500> wait<00:02:43.709> until<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.549> sides<00:02:44.760> are

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
just wait until like the sides are

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.080 
just wait until like the sides are
brownish<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:47.130> see<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> bubbles<00:02:47.850> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
brownish and you can see the bubbles and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.039 
brownish and you can see the bubbles and
it'll<00:02:48.480> look<00:02:49.310> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.340> weird<00:02:50.489> yes<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.900> one's

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it'll look kind of weird yes that one's

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.870 
it'll look kind of weird yes that one's
undercooked<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.340> flip<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.700> over

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
undercooked but we can flip it over

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.390 
undercooked but we can flip it over
again<00:02:54.570> always<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.900> should<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.590> good

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
again always so it should be a good

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.810 
again always so it should be a good
