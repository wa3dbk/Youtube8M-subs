00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.020 
to your left
it<00:01:45.649> seems<00:01:45.890> noticeably<00:01:46.369> brighter<00:01:46.930> your<00:01:47.930> right

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030

here<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.240> incandescent<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.979> that's<00:01:58.130> me<00:01:58.430> I

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
here is the incandescent and that's me I

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.870 
here is the incandescent and that's me I
know<00:01:59.539> looking<00:01:59.899> half<00:02:00.320> my<00:02:00.560> face<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:03.619> half

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
know looking half my face is this half

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.210 
know looking half my face is this half
his<00:02:04.880> brighter<00:02:05.270> lit<00:02:05.690> up<00:02:05.810> by<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.220> incandescent

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
his brighter lit up by the incandescent

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.969 
his brighter lit up by the incandescent
this<00:02:08.000> half<00:02:08.239> by<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.600> LED<00:02:09.140> bulb<00:02:09.350> what's

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this half by the LED bulb what's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.759 
this half by the LED bulb what's
important<00:02:10.369> here<00:02:10.459> though<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.670> think<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.769> LED

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
important here though I think is the LED

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.800 
important here though I think is the LED
bulbs<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.400> are<00:02:13.610> bright<00:02:14.209> enough

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
bulbs really are bright enough

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.840 
bulbs really are bright enough
plenty<00:02:15.140> bright<00:02:15.290> enough<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:16.489> three<00:02:16.790> of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
plenty bright enough I have three of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.729 
plenty bright enough I have three of
these<00:02:16.940> for<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> boat<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.630> three<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.650> these

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
these for the boat and three of these

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.300 
these for the boat and three of these
pairs<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.560> we're<00:02:21.560> gonna<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.800> drawing<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.280> lot
