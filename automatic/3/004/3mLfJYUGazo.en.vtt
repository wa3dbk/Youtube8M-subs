00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
reflecting on I was like what's that

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.280 
reflecting on I was like what's that
reflection<00:06:05.400> does<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:06.360> look<00:06:06.510> like<00:06:06.720> rust<00:06:07.050> it's

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
reflection does it look like rust it's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:16.159 
reflection does it look like rust it's
uh<00:06:07.470> it's<00:06:08.310> actually<00:06:08.400> got<00:06:08.729> reflection<00:06:09.360> now

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.810 

okay<00:06:17.169> well<00:06:17.320> good<00:06:17.530> I'm<00:06:18.070> happy<00:06:18.430> with<00:06:18.520> it<00:06:18.580> and

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
okay well good I'm happy with it and

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.629 
okay well good I'm happy with it and
that's<00:06:18.910> why<00:06:19.120> I'm<00:06:19.210> showing<00:06:19.419> it<00:06:19.740> I<00:06:20.740> wish<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.490> had

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
that's why I'm showing it I wish I had

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.980 
that's why I'm showing it I wish I had
two<00:06:21.730> before<00:06:22.090> but<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.419> didn't<00:06:22.660> think<00:06:22.750> it<00:06:22.930> was

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
two before but I didn't think it was

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.990 
two before but I didn't think it was
going<00:06:23.139> to<00:06:23.230> do<00:06:23.440> anything<00:06:23.710> drastic<00:06:24.040> like<00:06:24.490> that<00:06:24.760> I

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
going to do anything drastic like that I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.629 
going to do anything drastic like that I
just<00:06:25.840> was<00:06:25.960> trying<00:06:26.139> to<00:06:26.320> clean<00:06:26.590> them<00:06:26.740> I<00:06:26.950> didn't

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
just was trying to clean them I didn't

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.860 
just was trying to clean them I didn't
think<00:06:27.730> that<00:06:27.910> it<00:06:28.060> was<00:06:28.150> going<00:06:28.330> to<00:06:28.389> take<00:06:28.570> all<00:06:28.720> that

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
think that it was going to take all that

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.690 
think that it was going to take all that
pitting<00:06:29.050> off<00:06:29.320> even<00:06:29.830> though<00:06:29.950> I<00:06:29.980> kind<00:06:30.280> of<00:06:30.460> knew

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
pitting off even though I kind of knew

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.629 
pitting off even though I kind of knew
that<00:06:32.370> the<00:06:33.370> rust<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.740> vinegar<00:06:36.280> would

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
that the rust that the vinegar would

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.129 
that the rust that the vinegar would
remove<00:06:36.970> rust<00:06:37.270> I<00:06:37.480> didn't<00:06:37.720> think<00:06:37.780> it<00:06:37.900> was<00:06:37.990> going

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
remove rust I didn't think it was going

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.950 
remove rust I didn't think it was going
to<00:06:38.260> do<00:06:38.380> that<00:06:38.590> much<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:39.160> it<00:06:39.510> make<00:06:40.510> it<00:06:40.660> such<00:06:40.810> an

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
buckets are and reproduction net that I

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.320 
buckets are and reproduction net that I
believe<00:06:59.639> they<00:07:00.639> just<00:07:00.669> out<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.180> make<00:07:01.300> a

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
believe they just out and make a

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.510 
believe they just out and make a
reproduction<00:07:01.990> parts<00:07:02.139> for<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.470> 68<00:07:02.800> barracuda

so<00:07:04.300> stuff<00:07:04.780> is<00:07:04.960> really<00:07:05.139> expensive<00:07:05.620> and<00:07:06.300> you

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
so stuff is really expensive and you

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.020 
so stuff is really expensive and you
know<00:07:08.350> I<00:07:08.380> was<00:07:08.680> able<00:07:08.830> to<00:07:09.160> make<00:07:09.340> a<00:07:09.370> drive<00:07:09.700> out<00:07:10.000> of

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
know I was able to make a drive out of

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.790 
know I was able to make a drive out of
this<00:07:10.300> even<00:07:10.630> though<00:07:10.750> it's<00:07:10.870> dented<00:07:11.380> and<00:07:11.560> stuff

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
this even though it's dented and stuff

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.040 
this even though it's dented and stuff
like<00:07:11.979> that<00:07:12.220> it<00:07:12.639> still<00:07:13.180> cleaned<00:07:13.479> it<00:07:13.600> up<00:07:13.720> nice

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
like that it still cleaned it up nice

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.730 
like that it still cleaned it up nice
where<00:07:14.680> I<00:07:14.710> can<00:07:14.889> put<00:07:15.010> it<00:07:15.100> back<00:07:15.190> on<00:07:15.370> the<00:07:15.490> car<00:07:15.700> and

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
where I can put it back on the car and

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.230 
where I can put it back on the car and
there's<00:07:17.740> a<00:07:17.800> nice<00:07:17.950> uh<00:07:17.979> what<00:07:18.550> 24
