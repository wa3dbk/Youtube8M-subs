00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
 dear colleagues, good evening, we are starting 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.529
 salt post-match press conference with 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 the participation of foreign teams Andreevich 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.440
 Pashkina Yenisei Krasnoyarsk or gallery 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.300
 Shcherbatova pleaser Harms first question to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 the comment was Andreevich 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.400
 but the mother certainly liked the fans 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 monaco in tension 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.539
 On the game I will say that at the date we played by 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.539
 the wind 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 advantage of four goals went to 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.550
 break 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 in the second half have already changed the role 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.199
 the rival played in the wind regret us 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.829
 it was enough deletion played 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.040
 minority vodnik realized their 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.590
 moment by moment 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.980
 those moments that we created with us 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:04.680
 they realized that's probably so but here 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.680
 mothers run out of favor 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.230
 cadets what actually 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.730
 interesting for the fans 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.810
 I think that they are in the Neva New 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.900
 version did not go too 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.170
 let's say the ball if everything goes well there 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.310
 it could not just insult 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.290
 so guys are great 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.890
 It's great that they did not finish everything 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.700
 this game we kept probably yes clicked 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 all the same, all that and we had emotions 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 thank 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.220
 Andreevich exactly a year ago I asked you 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.480
 do you read defeat any by 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.650
 vodnik they sow this year the situation 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.760
 This splash is repeated , that is, you are no longer 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.730
 think slap 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.170
 10 another let's give us a war 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.700
 that there is not any strange 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.490
 situation team plays 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.860
 component well and with a margin of players and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.260
 do not fill as soon as the composition 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.780
 compared immediately along the important voice 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.910
 somehow it turns out that fire and not 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.410
 using numerical hello what is it not 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.360
 only water used is actually 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.500
 it often happens that the team plays matter 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.270
 better than playing force defensive field 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.030
 You can, too, because the guys play like 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.220
 would be more strictly more responsible but 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.250
 it is not only we say it everywhere so 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.640
 and we play substance better than when all 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
 on the field in defense here is a paradox but 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.300
 This is usually why for some reason 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.630
 team a series of calculations harder to score 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.250
 than let's say so we pass the composition or I 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.650
 Conveniently explained that the addict 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.420
 reconstructed most likely to 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.310
 pure logical yes say something 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.650
 jumps unhappy much more severe 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.420
 plays more responsibility here but 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.549
 selfless she so turns out 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.870
 maybe then most plays seems well 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:12.819
 we will score an hour therefore here honestly looking 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.819
 very hard to explain this so hope 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.420
 mystics still there something a year ago 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.360
 similar match in Arkhangelsk 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.700
 pain some lost won in 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.569
 end up with the same soviet cards 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.400
 can happen 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.520
 because this is an explanation but that's just 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.550
 humanly well you said mystic 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.680
 so let's leave how to explain it 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.069
 in how can you explain this too 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.260
 planning doesn't know this fans very 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.690
 interesting let it be so inside 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.280
 some kind of foreboding and so 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.209
 further that this day should study on 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.400
 like were gentle provides ca n't 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.780
 say what will happen then like me 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.300
 Duck here this does not need such a better 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:03.130
 many 40 or calmly won segment 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.130
 often wrote a good day was pretty 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.500
 this feeling she influenced that in the game not 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.360
 able to take Sergey Lomanov 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.360
 alan jackson heal the world 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.180
 so just who just of course 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.820
 influenced for leading players but but with 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.860
 the other side is the team there are champions 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.110
 guys are very good very much and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.770
 very good teams so this is what 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.360
 I say today we won well how are you 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.960
 for us it is very good and so it is very 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.960
 strong team 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:52.710
 no matter how graded you put your 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.710
 end game I thought post washing 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.919
 fives 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.460
 I said think 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.190
 what 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:09.610
 chorus alina what are building estimates 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 fives
