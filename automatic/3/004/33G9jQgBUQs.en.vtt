00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
jump so I'm gonna put a little bit of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
jump so I'm gonna put a little bit of
flour<00:00:22.109> down<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.650> take<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.250> rolling<00:00:23.580> pin<00:00:23.609> here

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

flour down and take my rolling pin here
and<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> flatten<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> bit

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

and then what we're gonna do is just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
and then what we're gonna do is just
take<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:32.099> dried<00:00:32.309> cherries<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.910> raisins

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
them into the dough it's meant to look

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
them into the dough it's meant to look
like<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> mountain<00:00:37.860> range<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.370> snow<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.579> top
