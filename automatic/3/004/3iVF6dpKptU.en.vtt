00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
gallows
what<00:00:51.329> should<00:00:51.480> look<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.600> interesting<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
what should look pretty interesting and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
then when I got home I was looking

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.360 
then when I got home I was looking
around<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> seeing<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:55.890> horror

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100 
scare the audience but the guy has not
had<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.430> track<00:01:26.729> record<00:01:27.150> probably

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
had a very good track record probably

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100 
had a very good track record probably
over<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> past<00:01:28.890> ten<00:01:29.400> maybe<00:01:30.390> fifteen<00:01:30.840> years

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
over the past ten maybe fifteen years

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
over the past ten maybe fifteen years
now<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:32.820> can't<00:01:33.180> churn<00:01:33.570> out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
now it's just they can't churn out

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
now it's just they can't churn out
anything<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.290> good<00:01:35.130> lately<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
anything that's good lately so the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.020 
anything that's good lately so the
premise<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> visit<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.520> some<00:01:38.520> kids<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
premise of the visit is some kids that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
premise of the visit is some kids that
go<00:01:39.180> visit<00:01:39.570> their<00:01:39.689> grandparents<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.409> week

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
go visit their grandparents for the week

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.980 
go visit their grandparents for the week
and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:41.970> weird<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.450> start

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and then all these weird things start

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600 
and then all these weird things start
happening<00:01:43.170> while<00:01:43.649> they're<00:01:43.860> visiting<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
happening while they're visiting and it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
happening while they're visiting and it
looks<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.270> found-footage<00:01:45.659> type

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
looks kind of like a found-footage type

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
looks kind of like a found-footage type
of<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> can't<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.310> gauge<00:01:48.030> whether<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of you I can't really gauge whether it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.530

director<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.680> horror<00:02:19.950> would<00:02:20.430> put<00:02:21.030> out

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
director of horror would put out

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390

something<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.830> doesn't<00:02:22.830> look<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.190> good

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
something that doesn't look that good

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800 
something that doesn't look that good
and<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.730> movie<00:02:23.970> trailer<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.420> she'd<00:02:24.630> grab

this one it didn't really grab me its

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.840 
this one it didn't really grab me its
first<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:07.800> kind<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> long<00:03:08.400> trailer

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
first of all it's kind of a long trailer

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.840 
first of all it's kind of a long trailer
it's<00:03:08.970> almost<00:03:09.120> 5<00:03:09.450> minutes<00:03:09.690> long<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
it's almost 5 minutes long and then you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's almost 5 minutes long and then you
see<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.209> family<00:03:12.420> having<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> house<00:03:13.110> built<00:03:13.470> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
see this family having the house built I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.940 
see this family having the house built I
think<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:14.160> might<00:03:14.580> be<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.090> same<00:03:15.770> grounds<00:03:16.770> as

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
think it might be on the same grounds as

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970 
think it might be on the same grounds as
the<00:03:17.940> previous<00:03:18.660> house<00:03:18.900> with<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> couple<00:03:19.860> in

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the previous house with the couple in

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.350 
the previous house with the couple in
the<00:03:20.070> first<00:03:20.280> Paranormal<00:03:20.700> Activity<00:03:20.760> I'm<00:03:21.209> not

the first Paranormal Activity I'm not
sure<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.350> then<00:03:22.500> they're<00:03:22.830> kind<00:03:23.040> of

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
sure about that but then they're kind of

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.530 
sure about that but then they're kind of
going<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.580> visiting<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.000> house<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.360> it's

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540

going and visiting the house as it's
being<00:03:24.690> built<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.739> all<00:03:25.860> these

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
being built and then you see all these

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.949 
being built and then you see all these
weird<00:03:26.280> things<00:03:26.370> start<00:03:26.910> happening<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
