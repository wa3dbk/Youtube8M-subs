alien while I was asleep and then we

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.210 
alien while I was asleep and then we
were<00:03:58.650> able<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.070> too

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.040

well where am I looking for work our way
out<00:04:04.320> work<00:04:04.830> our<00:04:05.100> way<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:06.240> all<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
out work our way and all this but the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.430 
out work our way and all this but the
the<00:04:08.940> guys<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.420> Trojan<00:04:09.720> horse<00:04:09.840> didn't<00:04:10.110> work

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the guys the Trojan horse didn't work

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.360 
the guys the Trojan horse didn't work
their<00:04:10.680> way<00:04:10.800> out<00:04:10.830> they<00:04:11.040> were<00:04:11.880> able<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.150> sneak<00:04:12.510> a

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
their way out they were able to sneak a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.270 
their way out they were able to sneak a
slither<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.640> were<00:04:14.700> able<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.940> slither<00:04:15.390> out<00:04:16.280> but

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
slither we were able to slither out but

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.509 
slither we were able to slither out but
with<00:04:17.700> them<00:04:17.850> unaware<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:19.070> go<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> killing

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
with them unaware and go on a killing

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.960 
with them unaware and go on a killing
rampage<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:22.079> there's<00:04:22.440> there<00:04:23.340> was<00:04:23.460> more

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
rampage and so there's there was more

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.550 
rampage and so there's there was more
than<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.360> expected<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> initial<00:04:25.410> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
than we expected like the initial to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.260 
than we expected like the initial to
that<00:04:25.740> spaceship<00:04:26.160> was<00:04:26.310> huge<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:26.940> was<00:04:27.060> much

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
that spaceship was huge it was much

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.550 
that spaceship was huge it was much
bigger<00:04:27.600> on<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.840> inside<00:04:28.050> than<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.350> looked<00:04:28.530> from

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
bigger on the inside than it looked from

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.840 
bigger on the inside than it looked from
the<00:04:28.680> outside<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.070> don't<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.580> may<00:04:29.730> have

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
the outside I don't know it may have

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.600 
the outside I don't know it may have
looked<00:04:29.940> very<00:04:30.360> small<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.080> think<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.010> guys<00:04:32.220> I

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
looked very small I think to you guys I

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.700 
looked very small I think to you guys I
wish<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.030> got<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.330> was<00:04:33.420> small<00:04:33.630> too<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.110> think

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
wish we got it was small too I think

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.520 
wish we got it was small too I think
they<00:04:34.770> used<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.570> up<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.140> mobius<00:04:37.500> strip

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
they used the up like the mobius strip

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.800 
they used the up like the mobius strip
type<00:04:38.010> logic<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.850> space<00:04:39.180> folded<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.720> on

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
type logic like the space folded in on

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.620 
type logic like the space folded in on
itself<00:04:39.960> because<00:04:40.620> like<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.980> was<00:04:41.130> like<00:04:41.340> yes<00:04:42.210> it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
itself because like it was like yes it

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.330 
itself because like it was like yes it
seemed<00:04:42.870> like<00:04:43.050> setting<00:04:43.350> football<00:04:43.740> fields<00:04:44.160> like

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
seemed like setting football fields like

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.200 
seemed like setting football fields like
we<00:04:44.520> think<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:45.230> three<00:04:46.230> dimensions<00:04:46.800> as<00:04:47.160> in<00:04:47.370> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
we think of three dimensions as in this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.570 
we think of three dimensions as in this
way<00:04:48.420> this<00:04:48.660> way<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:48.900> way<00:04:49.350> but<00:04:50.070> they<00:04:50.190> were<00:04:50.250> like

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
way this way this way but they were like

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.450 
way this way this way but they were like
this<00:04:51.060> way<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.420> way<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.660> way<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.230> way<00:04:52.560> that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
this way this way this way this way that

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.690 
this way this way this way this way that
way<00:04:53.730> over<00:04:54.510> there<00:04:54.660> all<00:04:55.200> hold<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:55.980> on<00:04:56.310> them<00:04:56.520> so

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
way over there all hold it in on them so

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.840 
way over there all hold it in on them so
all<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.840> was<00:04:57.990> like<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.169> like<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.950> black<00:04:59.250> hole<00:04:59.580> in

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
all it was like a like a black hole in

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.399 
all it was like a like a black hole in
the<00:04:59.940> way<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.150> was<00:05:00.540> so<00:05:00.720> dense<00:05:01.140> but<00:05:02.070> so

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
the way it was so dense but so

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.329 
the way it was so dense but so
so<00:05:04.239> populated<00:05:05.239> at<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.599> same<00:05:05.809> time<00:05:06.050> yeah<00:05:06.709> like

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:07.339 
so populated at the same time yeah like

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:08.559 
so populated at the same time yeah like
I'm<00:05:07.459> from<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.729> outside<00:05:08.119> it<00:05:08.330> was<00:05:08.389> like<00:05:08.539> a

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
I'm from the outside it was like a

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.659 
I'm from the outside it was like a
singularity<00:05:09.229> even<00:05:09.619> then<00:05:09.739> from<00:05:09.979> it<00:05:10.129> from<00:05:10.550> the

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
singularity even then from it from the

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.629 
singularity even then from it from the
inside<00:05:10.819> it<00:05:11.300> was<00:05:11.419> like<00:05:11.599> a<00:05:11.629> like<00:05:12.169> an<00:05:12.319> expanded<00:05:13.039> it

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
inside it was like a like an expanded it

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.749 
inside it was like a like an expanded it
was<00:05:13.789> huge<00:05:14.229> but<00:05:15.229> anyway<00:05:16.009> so<00:05:16.309> we<00:05:16.429> are<00:05:16.519> going

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
was huge but anyway so we are going

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.659 
was huge but anyway so we are going
around<00:05:17.029> from<00:05:17.300> room<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.689> room<00:05:17.719> shanken<00:05:18.679> all<00:05:19.159> the

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
around from room to room shanken all the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.350 
around from room to room shanken all the
aliens<00:05:20.629> using<00:05:21.110> while<00:05:21.559> they<00:05:21.709> hit<00:05:21.889> their<00:05:22.360> drug

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
aliens using while they hit their drug

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.889 
aliens using while they hit their drug
ions<00:05:23.749> using<00:05:24.709> yes<00:05:25.129> implements<00:05:26.119> we<00:05:26.419> broke<00:05:26.749> the

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:26.899 
ions using yes implements we broke the

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:30.249 
ions using yes implements we broke the
staff<00:05:27.169> in<00:05:27.409> half<00:05:27.649> so<00:05:28.429> that<00:05:28.459> way<00:05:28.939> because<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.779> only

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
staff in half so that way because I only

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.629 
staff in half so that way because I only
have<00:05:30.379> one<00:05:30.529> staff<00:05:30.830> now<00:05:31.069> that<00:05:31.189> was<00:05:31.309> broken<00:05:31.399> in

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
have one staff now that was broken in

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.009 
have one staff now that was broken in
half<00:05:31.759> I<00:05:32.029> was<00:05:32.209> able<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.389> have<00:05:32.509> one<00:05:32.629> he<00:05:32.809> was<00:05:32.929> able

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:33.019 
half I was able to have one he was able

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.169 
half I was able to have one he was able
to<00:05:33.199> have<00:05:33.319> one<00:05:33.469> and<00:05:33.649> we<00:05:33.860> attached<00:05:34.189> scalpels

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:35.179 
to have one and we attached scalpels

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:37.149 
to have one and we attached scalpels
from<00:05:35.599> their<00:05:35.749> operating<00:05:36.199> tables<00:05:36.709> on<00:05:36.949> to<00:05:37.069> the

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
from their operating tables on to the

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.909 
from their operating tables on to the
end<00:05:37.309> and<00:05:37.639> just<00:05:37.969> slit<00:05:38.809> and<00:05:39.199> we<00:05:39.349> found<00:05:39.559> laser

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
end and just slit and we found laser

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.049 
end and just slit and we found laser
guns<00:05:40.419> which<00:05:41.619> did<00:05:42.619> quite<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:42.979> number<00:05:43.099> we

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:44.059 
guns which did quite a number we

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:45.850 
guns which did quite a number we
actually<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.629> remember<00:05:44.989> us<00:05:45.139> heading<00:05:45.499> up<00:05:45.649> just

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
actually I remember us heading up just

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.529 
actually I remember us heading up just
dropping<00:05:46.279> the<00:05:46.399> stinks<00:05:46.819> because<00:05:46.939> the<00:05:47.179> lasers

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
dropping the stinks because the lasers

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.779 
dropping the stinks because the lasers
we<00:05:47.719> do<00:05:47.839> it<00:05:47.959> so<00:05:48.139> well<00:05:48.289> yeah<00:05:48.579> initially<00:05:49.579> we<00:05:49.669> use

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
we do it so well yeah initially we use

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.549 
we do it so well yeah initially we use
the<00:05:49.939> sticks<00:05:50.269> so<00:05:50.719> it's<00:05:50.869> not<00:05:50.959> to<00:05:51.110> blow<00:05:51.319> our<00:05:51.469> cover

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:51.559 
the sticks so it's not to blow our cover

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.589 
the sticks so it's not to blow our cover
but<00:05:52.369> it's<00:05:52.489> pretty<00:05:52.639> soon<00:05:52.849> all<00:05:52.999> hell<00:05:53.239> had<00:05:53.360> broken

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
but it's pretty soon all hell had broken

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.779 
but it's pretty soon all hell had broken
loose<00:05:53.749> anyway<00:05:54.199> when<00:05:54.739> you<00:05:54.769> shoot<00:05:55.219> a<00:05:55.309> drag<00:05:55.579> I'd

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
loose anyway when you shoot a drag I'd

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.639 
loose anyway when you shoot a drag I'd
it<00:05:56.149> sounds<00:05:56.779> like<00:05:57.550> Alanis<00:05:58.550> Morissette<00:05:59.300> it's

00:05:59.639 --> 00:05:59.649 
it sounds like Alanis Morissette it's

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.739 
it sounds like Alanis Morissette it's
kind<00:06:00.649> of<00:06:00.709> a<00:06:00.860> loud<00:06:01.369> I<00:06:01.759> reaching<00:06:02.269> that<00:06:02.479> would<00:06:02.629> be

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:02.749 
kind of a loud I reaching that would be

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:04.779 
kind of a loud I reaching that would be
an<00:06:02.839> understatement<00:06:02.959> yeah<00:06:03.769> a<00:06:04.369> min<00:06:04.699> an

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
an understatement yeah a min an

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.939 
an understatement yeah a min an
understatement<00:06:05.360> yeah<00:06:05.809> it<00:06:06.259> sounds<00:06:06.649> like<00:06:06.679> that

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
understatement yeah it sounds like that

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.999 
understatement yeah it sounds like that
Asian<00:06:07.429> music<00:06:10.959> yeah<00:06:11.959> it's<00:06:12.259> not<00:06:12.559> to<00:06:12.740> be<00:06:12.829> racist

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
Asian music yeah it's not to be racist

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.609 
Asian music yeah it's not to be racist
but<00:06:13.550> I<00:06:13.879> mean<00:06:14.119> well<00:06:14.419> that<00:06:14.569> was<00:06:14.899> their<00:06:15.050> cover<00:06:15.289> so

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:15.619

but I mean well that was their cover so
yeah<00:06:15.889> I<00:06:16.129> mean<00:06:16.279> anything<00:06:16.550> that's<00:06:16.699> why<00:06:16.819> that's

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029 
yeah I mean anything that's why that's

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.669 
yeah I mean anything that's why that's
probably<00:06:17.269> why<00:06:17.569> that's<00:06:18.229> probably<00:06:18.379> why<00:06:18.559> the

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:18.679 
probably why that's probably why the

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.199 
probably why that's probably why the
music<00:06:19.009> sounds<00:06:19.309> like<00:06:19.429> that<00:06:19.610> is<00:06:19.729> because<00:06:19.879> most

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:20.209 
music sounds like that is because most

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.969 
music sounds like that is because most
of<00:06:20.389> them<00:06:20.509> doing<00:06:20.719> that<00:06:20.869> are<00:06:21.110> actually<00:06:21.259> drag

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
of them doing that are actually drag
