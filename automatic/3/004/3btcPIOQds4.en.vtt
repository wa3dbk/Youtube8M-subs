00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.359
 this festival is today one of the only 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 sports he knows well since I 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 am an athlete we will leave time to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 try it hurts it good here for the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 rugby it's very simple it's played on 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 a green rectangle usually it's up to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 15h to stop this to fifteen against 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 fifteen you have is what is called the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 line of in goal ie it is here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.090
 that we must put the tests since 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.350
 you have both poles when you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.730
 put an essay it's 5 points when 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.140
 you score the shoah is paid when 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 you simply mark between the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 poles that makes transformation what we 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 call rugby transformation 5 inches of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.059
 equal 7-11 play kara so it takes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.230
 especially pass the ball by the gasque if 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.579
 you pass the ball by the sale this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 which is called a forward and the foremost 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.640
 was penalized in rugby I prefer 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.840
 important rugby what's called the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.700
 scrambled in order to once again stand out the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 balloon and in order to be able to bring the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 balloon as much given rise to the opposing goal 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.830
 without being able to score points and that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 who has more weight in rugby is the one 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 who wins is not basketball and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.810
