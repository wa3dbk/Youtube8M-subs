00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
visor back on and there we go okay now

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.559 
visor back on and there we go okay now
would<00:01:31.609> it<00:01:31.729> take<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> look<00:01:31.999> at<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.240> satellite

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
would it take a look at the satellite

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.219 
would it take a look at the satellite
and<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.319> shuttle<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:34.569> by<00:01:35.569> looking<00:01:35.899> at<00:01:36.109> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
and the shuttle just by looking at it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.319 
and the shuttle just by looking at it
you<00:01:36.829> probably<00:01:37.009> not<00:01:37.219> sure<00:01:37.399> what<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.700> until

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
you probably not sure what it is until

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.630 
you probably not sure what it is until
these<00:01:38.539> parts<00:01:38.869> open<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.490> that's<00:01:40.490> what

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
these parts open up and that's what

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880 
these parts open up and that's what
makes<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:40.939> looks<00:01:41.090> like<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.240> satellite<00:01:41.649> okay<00:01:42.649> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
makes it looks like a satellite okay and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.319 
makes it looks like a satellite okay and
it's<00:01:43.039> pretty<00:01:43.219> neat<00:01:43.490> that's<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.210> looks

here's<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> landing<00:02:19.100> gear<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.460> do<00:02:19.640> not

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
here's the landing gear and do not

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.570 
here's the landing gear and do not
retract<00:02:20.290> okay<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.350> maybe<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.070> rip<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.460> off

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
retract okay so maybe just rip it off

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.420 
retract okay so maybe just rip it off
when<00:02:22.760> you're<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.180> atmosphere<00:02:23.600> who<00:02:23.990> knows

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
when you're in the atmosphere who knows

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.680 
when you're in the atmosphere who knows
here's<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> back<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.210> love<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> way<00:02:26.570> they

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
here's the back and I love the way they

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.250 
here's the back and I love the way they
did<00:02:26.720> that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
did that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.440 
did that
okay<00:02:27.830> these<00:02:28.010> parts<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.730> swing<00:02:29.060> open<00:02:29.210> like

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
okay these parts can swing open like

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.880 
okay these parts can swing open like
this<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.930> guess<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.380> want<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.590> fix<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
this I guess if you want to fix the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.680 
this I guess if you want to fix the
engine<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.250> something<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.240> don't<00:02:32.480> think

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
engine or something but I don't think

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.100 
engine or something but I don't think

it's intended to here's the front okay

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.170 
it's intended to here's the front okay
and<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.220> marked<00:02:37.490> piece<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
fly a space shuttle then I guess

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.570 
fly a space shuttle then I guess
anything<00:02:51.020> goes<00:02:51.170> nowadays<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:52.100> put<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> pot

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
here we go alright these bay doors do

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.380 
here we go alright these bay doors do
not<00:03:09.380> open<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.860> movie<00:03:10.280> as<00:03:10.520> they<00:03:10.670> look<00:03:10.880> just

okay but it looks really nice from the
with<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.420> Bay's<00:03:17.570> open<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:19.340> arm<00:03:19.580> can

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
with the Bay's open and this arm can

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.660 
with the Bay's open and this arm can
come<00:03:20.360> up<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.810> can<00:03:20.989> rotate<00:03:21.140> all<00:03:21.620> right

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
come up and can rotate all right

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.780 
come up and can rotate all right
yes<00:03:23.239> space<00:03:23.510> for<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.400> space<00:03:25.400> somewhere<00:03:25.610> over

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
yes space for the space somewhere over

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.140 
yes space for the space somewhere over
here<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> satellite<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.459> this

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
here and this is the satellite and this

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.259 
here and this is the satellite and this
can<00:03:29.330> bend<00:03:29.540> down<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.890> way<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:32.000> just<00:03:32.150> got

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
can bend down all the way you just got

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.270 
can bend down all the way you just got
to<00:03:32.330> push<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.110> there<00:03:33.380> all<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.650> way<00:03:33.860> okay

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
to push that in there all the way okay

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.539 
to push that in there all the way okay
and<00:03:34.880> then<00:03:35.030> it'll<00:03:35.209> pull<00:03:35.510> up<00:03:36.190> how<00:03:37.190> cool<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.519> that

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and then it'll pull up how cool is that

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.720 
and then it'll pull up how cool is that
I<00:03:37.940> think<00:03:38.269> that's<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.540> neat<00:03:39.100> now<00:03:40.100> taking<00:03:40.610> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
I think that's really neat now taking it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.960 
I think that's really neat now taking it
off<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> little<00:03:41.120> tricky<00:03:41.600> okay<00:03:42.640> for<00:03:43.640> me<00:03:43.730> it's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
off is a little tricky okay for me it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.870 
off is a little tricky okay for me it's
been<00:03:44.120> 5050<00:03:44.570> so<00:03:44.959> far<00:03:45.340> here's<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> deciding

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
been 5050 so far here's the deciding

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.240 
been 5050 so far here's the deciding
point<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:47.630> rip<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.810> off<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.860> there<00:03:49.100> we<00:03:49.160> go

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
point just rip it off and there we go

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.680 
point just rip it off and there we go
this<00:03:49.489> piece<00:03:49.760> actually<00:03:50.060> stays<00:03:50.390> attached<00:03:50.660> to

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
this piece actually stays attached to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.240 
this piece actually stays attached to
satellite<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> first<00:03:51.590> time<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.739> did<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.010> though

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
satellite the first time I did it though

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.190 
satellite the first time I did it though
it<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:53.000> kind<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.299> stayed<00:03:53.480> with<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.750> arm<00:03:53.930> I

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
it this kind of stayed with the arm I

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.630 
it this kind of stayed with the arm I
guess<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:54.980> doesn't<00:03:55.130> matter

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
guess it doesn't matter

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.449 
guess it doesn't matter
it<00:03:55.940> looks<00:03:56.120> good<00:03:56.329> either<00:03:56.450> way<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.590> that's

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
it looks good either way but that's

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.350 
it looks good either way but that's
pretty<00:03:58.610> cool<00:03:58.910> right

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
pretty cool right

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.120 
pretty cool right
now<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.959> like<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> way<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.410> works<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.890> it

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
now I like the way that works and it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.330 
now I like the way that works and it
seems<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.459> fit<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:01.850> nicely<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:03.950> think<00:04:04.250> they

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
seems to fit just nicely so I think they

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.640 
seems to fit just nicely so I think they
did<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.519> really<00:04:04.610> good<00:04:04.940> job<00:04:05.000> with<00:04:05.180> this<00:04:05.390> set<00:04:05.650> so

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
did a really good job with this set so

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.770 
did a really good job with this set so
anyway<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.670> set<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.150> definitely<00:04:08.570> recommend

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
anyway this set I definitely recommend

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.229 
anyway this set I definitely recommend

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.850 

all<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:22.570> maybe<00:04:22.750> I'm<00:04:23.290> not<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.500> good<00:04:23.560> role

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
model but anyway it's a fun set the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.340 
model but anyway it's a fun set the
parts<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.670> pretty<00:04:27.760> good<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:29.050> sums<00:04:29.260> up

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
parts are pretty good and that sums up

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.500
