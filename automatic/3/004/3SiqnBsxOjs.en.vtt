 Lord of hollow rocks, 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
 Underground king over kings 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 He will take what he has. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 The bells will ring a joyful song 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 When the King of Mountains appears, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 However, all put on sadness, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 because the lake is burning with fire. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 You have no right, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 none to enter the Mountain. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 I have an exclusive right. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000

 The dwarf will never be king! 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Our time has come again. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 This is not our fight. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Are we not a part of this world? 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 You are looking for what could give you the right to wield. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Arkenstone. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And what is it? 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 That, burglar, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000

 The world is not a mortal danger. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I feel sorry for you. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 If it's supposed to end in fire, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I want to burn together! 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 You can not give up now! 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 It never ceases to amaze me. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 The courage of hobbits.
