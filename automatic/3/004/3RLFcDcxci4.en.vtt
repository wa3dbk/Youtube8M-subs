00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 has said of sleeves and moody without anything of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.940
 that and very easily but 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.940
 the creative on you later 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.449
 if you are in survival 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.640

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.600
 game of the day we can not 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.140
 and that's it 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.360
 10 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.150
 two 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.660
 as much as you want 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.370
 now beat energy and the creative state 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.370
 looking for it by the sea 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.920
 The first thing to do is 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.190
 find a village and make eggs 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.290
 and you are looking for the person you want 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.660
 the one you like most 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.660
 is talking about it being good 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.530
 It's Mr. Basta, Mrs. Marta 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 and you click on the lady 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840
 Martha 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.920
 and will give no son 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.130
 and the son himself I will also do 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.190
 click and also the son the father son with 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.190
 son 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.030
 with the son you can do any 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.030
 thing does not follow you 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.810
 it's the bad thing if you miss it very 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.090
 quickly good 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 it's fine it does not work 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.840
 and there will be seven they were always and they run 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.710
 very fast and that escapes very fast and they are 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.710
 very radio in radio 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.819
 and this and that but 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:09.020
 they die as they already have the same 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.020
 life I believe of equal allies 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.420
 wants to stay 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.420
 1 2 3 4 4 blows 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.939
 two 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.370
 the better the child dies faster me 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.370
 I think 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.620
 ll stones 1 2 3 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.740
 they die at three blows the two are 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.450
 just as invincible 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.870
