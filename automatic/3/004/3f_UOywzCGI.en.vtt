higher than high anything else beyond

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.820 
higher than high anything else beyond
there<00:00:38.750> it's<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.019> going<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.199> take<00:00:39.410> really

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
there it's just going to take really

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.130 
there it's just going to take really
long<00:00:40.040> time<00:00:40.640> even<00:00:40.940> high<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:41.540> going<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.960> take<00:00:42.110> a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
long time even high is going to take a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.160 
long time even high is going to take a
very<00:00:42.440> long<00:00:42.650> time<00:00:42.910> medium<00:00:43.910> is<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.090> good<00:00:44.330> one<00:00:44.510> that

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
very long time medium is a good one that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.780 
very long time medium is a good one that
does<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> very<00:00:45.680> good<00:00:45.890> quality<00:00:46.070> rendering<00:00:46.670> it

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
does a very good quality rendering it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.280 
does a very good quality rendering it
doesn't<00:00:47.000> take<00:00:47.120> too<00:00:47.360> too<00:00:47.390> long<00:00:47.870> as<00:00:48.079> you'll<00:00:48.230> find

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
doesn't take too too long as you'll find

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.010 
doesn't take too too long as you'll find
out<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.820> if<00:00:49.880> we<00:00:49.940> go<00:00:50.030> with<00:00:50.180> draft<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.629> start

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
out so if we go with draft to start

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.590 
out so if we go with draft to start
that'll<00:00:51.530> help<00:00:51.710> us<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:53.000> other<00:00:53.120> thing<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.450> got

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
that'll help us the other thing you got

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.170 
that'll help us the other thing you got
here<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.290> output<00:00:54.440> resolution<00:00:55.059> notice<00:00:56.059> it

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
here is the output resolution notice it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.290 
here is the output resolution notice it
says<00:00:56.390> screen<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.800> also<00:00:58.010> says<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.940> image

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
says screen and it also says the image

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.680 
says screen and it also says the image
size<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.899> bigger<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> image<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.730> longer

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
size the bigger the image the longer

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
size the bigger the image the longer
it's<00:01:02.809> going<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.020> take<00:01:03.260> notice<00:01:03.620> as<00:01:03.920> i<00:01:03.980> zoom<00:01:04.520> in

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's going to take notice as i zoom in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.790 
it's going to take notice as i zoom in
and<00:01:04.850> zoom<00:01:04.910> out<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:05.899> gets<00:01:06.170> bigger<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.619> bigger

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
and zoom out this gets bigger and bigger

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.460 
and zoom out this gets bigger and bigger
because<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.330> amount<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.990> has<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.259> render

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
because the amount that it has to render

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.200 
because the amount that it has to render
is<00:01:09.649> bigger<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.070> if<00:01:10.160> I<00:01:10.220> want<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.580> draft<00:01:10.910> I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
is bigger so if I want to do a draft I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.290 
is bigger so if I want to do a draft I
can<00:01:11.690> just<00:01:11.810> maybe<00:01:11.960> zoom<00:01:12.289> out<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.619> there<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.300> say

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
can just maybe zoom out to there and say

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.700 
can just maybe zoom out to there and say
you<00:01:14.360> know<00:01:14.509> what<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:14.960> right<00:01:15.229> there<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> good

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
you know what that right there is a good

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.530 
you know what that right there is a good
compromise<00:01:16.220> it'll<00:01:16.580> give<00:01:16.700> me<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> good<00:01:17.180> overall

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
compromise it'll give me a good overall

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.950 
compromise it'll give me a good overall
view<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.740> should<00:01:19.040> be<00:01:19.070> fairly<00:01:19.400> fast<00:01:19.960> next

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
view but it should be fairly fast next

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080 
view but it should be fairly fast next
we<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.200> lighting<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.310> what<00:01:22.520> scheme<00:01:22.850> are<00:01:23.000> we

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
we have lighting so what scheme are we

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090 
we have lighting so what scheme are we
going<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.299> use<00:01:23.479> main<00:01:24.229> thing<00:01:24.500> you're<00:01:24.650> choosing

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to use main thing you're choosing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.300 
going to use main thing you're choosing
here<00:01:25.330> interior<00:01:26.330> or<00:01:26.540> exterior<00:01:27.159> simple<00:01:28.189> I'm

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
here interior or exterior simple I'm

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.270 
here interior or exterior simple I'm
interior<00:01:28.970> next<00:01:29.930> do<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.290> want<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:30.890> see<00:01:31.130> how

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
interior next do we want to just see how

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.880 
interior next do we want to just see how
the<00:01:31.340> Sun<00:01:31.700> affects<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.630> space<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.619> could<00:01:33.740> do

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the Sun affects the space you could do

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.170 
the Sun affects the space you could do
that<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.250> could<00:01:34.280> run<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.970> want

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
that you could run that if you want

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.730 
that you could run that if you want
we're<00:01:35.720> going<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.900> run<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.110> Sun<00:01:36.439> entered

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
we're going to run a Sun entered

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.380 
we're going to run a Sun entered
official<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.400> what<00:01:37.520> that's<00:01:37.729> going<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.210> is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
official and what that's going to do is

could take two minutes could take 10
minutes<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:18.320> setting<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.799> probably

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
minutes at this setting it's probably

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.589 
minutes at this setting it's probably
not<00:02:19.190> going<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.400> take<00:02:19.459> very<00:02:19.610> long<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.329> if<00:02:20.450> you

not going to take very long but if you

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.690 
not going to take very long but if you
set<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.900> up<00:02:21.080> too<00:02:21.260> high<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.340> did<00:02:22.580> an

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
set it up too high and you did an

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.330 
set it up too high and you did an
enormous<00:02:23.060> sized<00:02:23.690> print<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.860> could<00:02:25.069> take<00:02:25.220> an

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
enormous sized print it could take an

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.860 
enormous sized print it could take an
hour<00:02:25.430> could<00:02:25.940> take<00:02:26.090> two<00:02:26.239> hours<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.660> three<00:02:26.840> hours

hour could take two hours or three hours
so<00:02:27.319> those<00:02:27.890> are<00:02:28.099> settings<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.120> play

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so those are settings you have to play

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.809 
so those are settings you have to play
with<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.260> order<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> happy<00:02:31.700> medium

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
with in order to get the happy medium

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.089 
with in order to get the happy medium
I'm<00:02:32.300> going<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> click<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.780> render<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.379> then

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
I'm going to click on render and then

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.640 
I'm going to click on render and then
we're<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.489> see<00:02:34.760> our<00:02:34.790> draft<00:02:35.500> now<00:02:36.500> you'll

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
we're going to see our draft now you'll

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.010 
we're going to see our draft now you'll
notice<00:02:36.860> here<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.550> starts<00:02:37.910> at<00:02:38.090> 0<00:02:38.510> this

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
notice here that it starts at 0 this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.619 
notice here that it starts at 0 this
first<00:02:39.410> part<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.950> takes<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.370> while<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.970> it's

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
first part of it takes a while and it's

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.210 
first part of it takes a while and it's
going<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.840> chug<00:02:42.140> for<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.440> little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:42.830> once<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
going to chug for a little bit once it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.339 
going to chug for a little bit once it
hits<00:02:43.400> 10<00:02:43.610> percent<00:02:44.120> usually<00:02:45.019> it's<00:02:45.140> going<00:02:45.200> to

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
hits 10 percent usually it's going to

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.110 
hits 10 percent usually it's going to
start<00:02:45.590> generating<00:02:45.890> onto<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.610> screen<00:02:46.970> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
start generating onto the screen and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.780 
start generating onto the screen and
it'll<00:02:48.080> sort<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.349> turn<00:02:48.560> black<00:02:48.890> yeah<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.640> then

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
it'll sort of turn black yeah and then

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.670 
it'll sort of turn black yeah and then
it'll<00:02:49.940> start<00:02:50.269> showing<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.470> pieces

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
it'll start showing you all the pieces

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.040 
it'll start showing you all the pieces
the<00:02:52.250> rendering<00:02:52.730> engine<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.330> uses<00:02:53.810> is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
the rendering engine that it uses is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.920 
the rendering engine that it uses is
called<00:02:54.769> mental<00:02:55.190> ray<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.660> same

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
called mental ray and that's the same

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.869 
called mental ray and that's the same
rendering<00:02:57.319> engine<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.099> get<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.489> 3d

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
rendering engine that you get in 3d

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.000 
rendering engine that you get in 3d
studio<00:02:59.060> max<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.319> you're<00:03:00.440> getting<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.709> very<00:03:00.860> high

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
studio max so you're getting a very high

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.630 
studio max so you're getting a very high
quality<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:02.030> light<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.900> materials<00:03:03.920> there's

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
quality of light and materials there's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.390 
quality of light and materials there's
our<00:03:04.879> draft<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.780> actual<00:03:06.230> resolution<00:03:07.069> is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
our draft and the actual resolution is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.220 
our draft and the actual resolution is
horrible<00:03:07.879> but<00:03:08.239> really<00:03:08.569> we're<00:03:08.720> just<00:03:08.870> looking

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
horrible but really we're just looking

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.080 
horrible but really we're just looking
is<00:03:09.379> that<00:03:09.410> basically<00:03:10.250> going<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.909> right

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
is that basically going in the right

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.119 
is that basically going in the right
direction<00:03:11.300> now<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.590> what<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.830> see

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
direction now if you like what you see

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.520 
direction now if you like what you see
you<00:03:13.580> can<00:03:13.790> bump<00:03:14.000> up<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.360> quality<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:14.989> this

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
you can bump up the quality and this

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.170 
you can bump up the quality and this
might<00:03:15.739> be<00:03:15.890> something<00:03:16.310> where<00:03:16.459> I'll<00:03:16.700> zoom<00:03:16.970> in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
might be something where I'll zoom in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.930 
might be something where I'll zoom in
now<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.720> always<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.800> save<00:03:19.190> intermittently

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
now I always like to save intermittently

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.729 
now I always like to save intermittently
as<00:03:20.180> well<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.569> I'm<00:03:20.780> rendering<00:03:21.379> because

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
as well as I'm rendering because

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.490 
as well as I'm rendering because
rendering<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.430> quite<00:03:22.700> intensive<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:24.170> just

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
rendering is quite intensive it's just

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770 
rendering is quite intensive it's just
hit<00:03:24.680> save<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.580> is<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.849> risk<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.599> could

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
hit save there is a risk that it could

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.420 
hit save there is a risk that it could
crash<00:03:27.050> while<00:03:27.409> rendering<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.069> runs<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.370> of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
crash while rendering if it runs out of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.000 
crash while rendering if it runs out of
memory<00:03:29.110> now<00:03:30.110> here<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:30.409> are<00:03:30.440> in<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> rendering

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
memory now here we are in the rendering

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.460 
memory now here we are in the rendering
box<00:03:31.340> let's<00:03:32.269> change<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.780> setting<00:03:33.230> now<00:03:33.409> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
box let's change the setting now to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920 
box let's change the setting now to
medium<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:35.000> will<00:03:35.090> give<00:03:35.239> us<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.510> little<00:03:35.780> bit

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
medium that will give us a little bit

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.250 
medium that will give us a little bit
higher<00:03:36.230> quality<00:03:36.260> our<00:03:37.780> pixel<00:03:38.780> rates<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.110> little

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
higher quality our pixel rates a little

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.350 
higher quality our pixel rates a little
higher<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.920> zoomed<00:03:40.159> in<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.299> is

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
higher because we zoomed in now this is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.149 
higher because we zoomed in now this is
going<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.690> take<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> little<00:03:42.260> while<00:03:42.530> longer

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
going to take a little while longer

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.039 
going to take a little while longer
but<00:03:43.519> it'll<00:03:43.700> be<00:03:43.790> much<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.000> same<00:03:44.330> process<00:03:44.569> it

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
but it'll be much the same process it

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.039 
but it'll be much the same process it
will<00:03:45.140> go<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.319> about<00:03:45.650> 2%<00:03:46.250> not<00:03:46.760> about<00:03:47.120> 10%<00:03:47.810> it'll

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
will go to about 2% not about 10% it'll

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.500 
will go to about 2% not about 10% it'll
start<00:03:48.319> regenerating<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:49.159> view<00:03:49.879> for<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.299> see

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
start regenerating a view for you to see

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.630 
start regenerating a view for you to see
so<00:03:50.840> let's<00:03:51.019> click<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.349> render

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
so let's click on render

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.730 
so let's click on render
so<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.180> see<00:03:53.420> here<00:03:53.660> I've<00:03:53.840> paused<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.560> just

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
so you can see here I've paused it just

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.710 
so you can see here I've paused it just
to<00:03:54.860> save<00:03:55.070> us<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.430> little<00:03:55.580> bit<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.880> time<00:03:56.150> we<00:03:56.540> don't

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
to save us a little bit of time we don't

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.480 
to save us a little bit of time we don't
really<00:03:56.840> want<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.200> just<00:03:57.350> watch<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.860> bar<00:03:58.220> go<00:03:58.460> to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
really want to just watch a bar go to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.100 
really want to just watch a bar go to
the<00:03:58.760> right<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.450> can<00:03:59.660> notice<00:03:59.900> here<00:04:00.080> that

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the right but you can notice here that

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.680 
the right but you can notice here that
the<00:04:00.320> rendering<00:04:00.590> time<00:04:00.920> right<00:04:01.130> now<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.490> at<00:04:01.700> 251

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
the rendering time right now is at 251

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.990 
the rendering time right now is at 251
and<00:04:03.230> Counting<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.430> know<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.730> specs

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
and Counting just so you know the specs

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.730 
and Counting just so you know the specs
on<00:04:05.210> my<00:04:05.630> machine<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.020> I'm<00:04:06.230> running<00:04:06.560> at<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
on my machine that I'm running at the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.990 
on my machine that I'm running at the
time<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.100> recording<00:04:07.460> it's<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.450> laptop<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.170> it's

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
time of recording it's a laptop and it's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.450 
time of recording it's a laptop and it's
32-bit<00:04:11.000> with<00:04:11.330> 4<00:04:11.690> gigs<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.020> RAM<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:13.250> have<00:04:13.430> a

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
32-bit with 4 gigs of RAM and I have a

NVIDIA<00:04:14.300> Quadro<00:04:14.440> graphics<00:04:15.440> card<00:04:15.710> so<00:04:15.890> it's<00:04:16.519> a

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
NVIDIA Quadro graphics card so it's a

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.500 
NVIDIA Quadro graphics card so it's a
decent<00:04:16.790> machine<00:04:17.329> but<00:04:17.540> on<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:18.140> 64-bit<00:04:18.890> machine

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
decent machine but on a 64-bit machine

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.910 
decent machine but on a 64-bit machine
multi-threaded<00:04:20.510> chip<00:04:21.049> you're<00:04:21.530> going<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.769> get

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
multi-threaded chip you're going to get

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.490

quite<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> fast<00:04:22.850> rendering<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.900> yours<00:04:24.080> may<00:04:24.470> be

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
quite a fast rendering so yours may be

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.620 
quite a fast rendering so yours may be
quite<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.070> bit<00:04:25.220> faster<00:04:25.669> than<00:04:25.790> mine<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.180> it's

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
quite a bit faster than mine and it's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.870 
quite a bit faster than mine and it's
giving<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.140> time<00:04:27.380> right<00:04:27.650> here<00:04:28.010> as<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.760> how

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
giving you the time right here as to how

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.360 
giving you the time right here as to how
long<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.480> be<00:04:29.540> taking<00:04:29.960> you

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
long it's going to be taking you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.010 
long it's going to be taking you
now<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.550> can<00:04:31.730> see<00:04:31.940> right<00:04:32.150> away<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.630> mean<00:04:32.870> the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
now you can see right away I mean the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020 
now you can see right away I mean the
quality<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:33.949> much<00:04:34.280> better<00:04:34.580> than<00:04:34.760> the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
quality on this is much better than the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.420 
quality on this is much better than the
draft<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.660> how<00:04:36.169> can<00:04:36.230> we<00:04:36.440> adjust<00:04:36.560> this<00:04:37.040> because

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
draft and how can we adjust this because

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.460 
draft and how can we adjust this because
the<00:04:37.610> title<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.090> video<00:04:38.389> was<00:04:38.600> rendering

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
the title of this video was rendering

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.020 
the title of this video was rendering
and<00:04:39.620> adjusting<00:04:40.160> let's<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.699> go<00:04:40.820> down<00:04:41.000> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
and adjusting let's just go down to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.290 
and adjusting let's just go down to
adjust<00:04:41.570> exposure<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.669> what<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:43.790> can<00:04:43.970> do<00:04:44.120> here

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
adjust exposure and what you can do here

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.270 
adjust exposure and what you can do here
I'm<00:04:44.449> going<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.630> click<00:04:44.750> on<00:04:45.050> reset<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.889> default

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
I'm going to click on reset to default

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.159 
I'm going to click on reset to default
so<00:04:46.430> we<00:04:46.520> make<00:04:46.729> sure<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.510> just<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
so we make sure that that is just the

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.810 
so we make sure that that is just the
default<00:04:48.560> setting<00:04:48.979> now<00:04:49.370> there's<00:04:49.580> little

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
default setting now there's little

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.610 
default setting now there's little
things<00:04:50.210> here<00:04:50.479> that<00:04:50.510> we<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.960> tweak<00:04:51.199> just<00:04:51.500> to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
things here that we can tweak just to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.920 
things here that we can tweak just to
make<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:51.800> look<00:04:51.949> a<00:04:52.280> little<00:04:52.550> bit<00:04:52.850> more<00:04:53.090> realistic

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
make it look a little bit more realistic

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.050 
make it look a little bit more realistic
I'm<00:04:54.440> not<00:04:54.650> going<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.860> say<00:04:55.010> realistic<00:04:55.639> actually

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
I'm not going to say realistic actually

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.180 
I'm not going to say realistic actually
because<00:04:56.479> this<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.139> realistic<00:04:57.740> for<00:04:57.889> the<00:04:58.010> time

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
because this is realistic for the time

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.950 
because this is realistic for the time
of<00:04:58.340> day<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.850> lights<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.300> we've<00:04:59.449> put<00:04:59.780> in

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
of day and the lights that we've put in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.040 
of day and the lights that we've put in
it<00:05:00.199> is<00:05:00.620> quite<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:00.919> realistic<00:05:01.520> rendering<00:05:02.050> now

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
it is quite a realistic rendering now

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.870 
it is quite a realistic rendering now
what<00:05:03.260> if<00:05:03.380> we<00:05:03.500> maybe<00:05:03.710> just<00:05:03.830> said<00:05:04.220> well<00:05:04.580> let's

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
what if we maybe just said well let's

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.250 
what if we maybe just said well let's
just<00:05:05.120> tweak<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.540> little<00:05:05.570> bit<00:05:05.840> here<00:05:06.110> we're

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
just tweak it a little bit here we're

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.510 
just tweak it a little bit here we're
going<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.410> make<00:05:06.560> our<00:05:06.740> highlights<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.310> little

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
going to make our highlights a little

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.640 
going to make our highlights a little
bit<00:05:07.639> darker<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.270> you<00:05:08.380> see<00:05:09.380> how<00:05:09.470> that's

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
bit darker and you see how that's

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.370 
bit darker and you see how that's
cutting<00:05:10.160> down<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.760> some<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.840> glare<00:05:12.320> that

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
cutting down on some of that glare that

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.600 
cutting down on some of that glare that
we've<00:05:12.770> got<00:05:13.010> right<00:05:13.220> there

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
we've got right there

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.249 
we've got right there
now<00:05:14.879> I'm<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.150> going<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.330> go<00:05:15.449> all<00:05:15.689> the<00:05:15.720> way<00:05:15.990> down

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
now I'm not going to go all the way down

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.499 
now I'm not going to go all the way down
I<00:05:16.500> find<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.039> have<00:05:17.159> to<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.430> small<00:05:17.819> tweaks<00:05:18.150> that

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
I find you have to do small tweaks that

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.480 
I find you have to do small tweaks that
tends<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.810> be<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.020> little<00:05:19.169> bit<00:05:19.409> better<00:05:19.590> now<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
tends to be a little bit better now the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.339 
tends to be a little bit better now the
shadows<00:05:21.030> maybe<00:05:21.300> we<00:05:21.539> want<00:05:21.810> those<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.199> be<00:05:22.229> a

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
shadows maybe we want those to be a

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.170 
shadows maybe we want those to be a
little<00:05:22.590> darker<00:05:23.039> that<00:05:23.639> will<00:05:23.819> give<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.150> a

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
little darker that will give you a

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.270 
little darker that will give you a
little<00:05:24.569> bit<00:05:24.719> more<00:05:24.900> depth<00:05:25.199> but<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.770> also<00:05:25.919> makes

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
little bit more depth but it also makes

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.760 
little bit more depth but it also makes
it<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.490> little<00:05:26.699> darker<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.330> their<00:05:27.530> mid-tones<00:05:28.530> I

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
it a little darker in their mid-tones I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.429 
it a little darker in their mid-tones I
find<00:05:29.069> if<00:05:29.189> you<00:05:29.310> make<00:05:29.460> those<00:05:29.669> darker<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:31.259> can

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
find if you make those darker that can

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.980 
find if you make those darker that can
be<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.590> good<00:05:31.800> compromise<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.819> like<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.930> said

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
be a good compromise and like I said

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.499 
be a good compromise and like I said
it's<00:05:34.379> very<00:05:34.500> much<00:05:35.129> a<00:05:35.159> tweaking<00:05:35.759> thing<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.300> just

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
it's very much a tweaking thing you just

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.240 
it's very much a tweaking thing you just
have<00:05:36.599> to<00:05:36.840> move<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.139> just<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.439> little<00:05:37.800> bit<00:05:38.009> and

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
have to move it just a little bit and

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.890 
have to move it just a little bit and
you'll<00:05:39.120> get<00:05:39.300> results

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.810 

now<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.170> white<00:05:42.470> point<00:05:42.770> what<00:05:43.070> that<00:05:43.250> means<00:05:43.550> is

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
now the white point what that means is

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.820 
now the white point what that means is
it's<00:05:44.240> sort<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.600> a<00:05:44.660> color<00:05:44.990> issue<00:05:45.290> do<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:45.650> want

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
it's sort of a color issue do you want

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.790 
it's sort of a color issue do you want
it<00:05:45.920> to<00:05:46.040> be<00:05:46.160> more<00:05:46.520> blue<00:05:47.030> or<00:05:47.690> do<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.410> want<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.680> to

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
it to be more blue or do you want it to

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.580 
it to be more blue or do you want it to
be<00:05:48.920> more<00:05:49.160> yellow<00:05:49.730> and<00:05:49.810> more<00:05:50.810> yellow<00:05:51.050> tends<00:05:51.440> to

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
be more yellow and more yellow tends to

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.380 
be more yellow and more yellow tends to
give<00:05:51.740> it<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.890> warmer<00:05:52.340> feel

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.180 

on<00:05:56.540> your<00:05:56.990> opinion<00:05:57.500> it's<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.740> very<00:05:57.950> subjective

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
on your opinion it's a very subjective

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.270 
on your opinion it's a very subjective
thing<00:05:58.610> this<00:05:59.270> art<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.900> rendering<00:06:00.440> now<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.070> also

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
thing this art of rendering now you also

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.460 
thing this art of rendering now you also
have<00:06:01.400> saturation<00:06:02.090> if<00:06:02.420> the<00:06:02.930> colors<00:06:03.260> are<00:06:03.440> a

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
have saturation if the colors are a

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.240 
have saturation if the colors are a
little<00:06:03.530> dull

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
little dull

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.250 
little dull
you<00:06:04.640> can<00:06:04.850> punch<00:06:05.090> them<00:06:05.300> up<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:05.600> little<00:06:05.690> bit<00:06:05.990> with

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
you can punch them up a little bit with

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.590 
you can punch them up a little bit with
your<00:06:06.560> saturation<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:07.700> can<00:06:07.790> see<00:06:07.970> very<00:06:08.270> very

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
your saturation you can see very very

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.140 
your saturation you can see very very
small<00:06:09.110> tweaks<00:06:09.470> will<00:06:10.040> do<00:06:10.220> once<00:06:10.760> you<00:06:10.880> get<00:06:11.000> the

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
small tweaks will do once you get the

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.440 
small tweaks will do once you get the
results<00:06:11.630> that<00:06:11.690> you<00:06:12.230> want<00:06:12.640> you<00:06:13.640> can<00:06:13.850> say<00:06:14.150> okay

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
results that you want you can say okay

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.870 
results that you want you can say okay
to<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:15.020> then<00:06:15.710> you<00:06:15.830> can<00:06:16.040> save<00:06:16.520> this<00:06:16.820> to

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
to that and then you can save this to

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.490 
to that and then you can save this to
the<00:06:17.120> project<00:06:17.720> so<00:06:17.900> I'm<00:06:17.960> just<00:06:18.110> going<00:06:18.230> to<00:06:18.290> say

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
the project so I'm just going to say

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.470 
the project so I'm just going to say
save<00:06:18.740> the<00:06:18.890> project<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.550> it's<00:06:20.240> called

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
save the project and it's called

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.960 
save the project and it's called
interior<00:06:20.840> one<00:06:21.320> that's<00:06:21.830> fine<00:06:22.100> I'll<00:06:22.340> say<00:06:22.640> okay

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
interior one that's fine I'll say okay

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.720 
interior one that's fine I'll say okay
now<00:06:23.750> that's<00:06:23.900> get<00:06:24.230> saved<00:06:24.680> if<00:06:25.100> we<00:06:25.460> shut<00:06:25.670> down

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
now that's get saved if we shut down

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.520 
now that's get saved if we shut down
rendering<00:06:26.450> that<00:06:26.720> gets<00:06:26.960> saved<00:06:27.230> in<00:06:27.380> your

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
rendering that gets saved in your

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.640 
rendering that gets saved in your
project<00:06:27.980> browser<00:06:28.300> under<00:06:29.300> renderings<00:06:29.780> let's

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
project browser under renderings let's

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.370 
project browser under renderings let's
just<00:06:30.860> expand<00:06:31.280> that<00:06:31.340> out<00:06:31.660> so<00:06:32.660> there<00:06:32.960> it<00:06:33.080> is

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
just expand that out so there it is

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.010 
just expand that out so there it is
now<00:06:33.890> we<00:06:33.950> would<00:06:34.250> be<00:06:34.340> able<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.730> export<00:06:35.420> this<00:06:35.750> if

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
now we would be able to export this if

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.100 
now we would be able to export this if
we<00:06:36.140> go<00:06:36.170> to<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:37.520> big<00:06:37.760> R<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.300> application<00:06:38.930> menu

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
we go to the big R the application menu

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.600 
we go to the big R the application menu
and<00:06:39.440> say<00:06:39.620> export<00:06:40.540> image<00:06:42.160> we<00:06:43.160> could<00:06:43.250> send<00:06:43.520> it

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
and say export image we could send it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.940 
and say export image we could send it
