00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 the giovanni when you make one of a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.550
 as good a match as yesterday 's 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.130
 including two goals and come home 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.210
 sleep quickly or if you are going to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.020
 goals 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.550
 It's another thing for you to honor. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 yesterday with a goal that was not even clear 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.590
 It's good, always good, playing well on both 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 matches back there I was so well 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.110
 Thank you in advance. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.309
 well when I arrived I went to see them in the fives 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.739
 goals and the homage I did was mna 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 from my mother that I live where she walks 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.620
 village he passed away and he took a step 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 there and everyone is doing there 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 and the people of the chamber asked to do this 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.570
 year motorcycle accident there in sÃ£o miguel 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 paulista 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.760
 But not everyone who's asking for 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.650
 me and I think if I was more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 yesterday after the renovation of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 The contract has nothing to do with it. 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.600
 a normal oscillation 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.030
 certainly after the renovation I had 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 some peace of mind to work 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 I was a little anxious for him to leave 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.290
 then the contract deal and after 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 I quit, I quit to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 work in peace even 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 Osvaldo yesterday in the collective he said that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.150
 He was sad to see the games you played. 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 I was not very happy 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.630
 You did not say anything to him but he 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.040
 You said you noticed this and you were there. 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 even sadder than it was 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.939
 I hug you after the game for you. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.530
 Do you know how he realized I was? 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 it was not cool 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.939
 in those last matches where I 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.549
 I was farther away, I went in. 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.969
 I managed to make the team goals 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.509
 So he realized that, so he gave it to me. 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.910
 That hug gave me congratulations and it 's 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.649
 Believing me, right? 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.960
 same playing not playing so well he 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.450
 remained in the team 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.640
 and believe me and I think I 'm 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.430
 very grateful to him for the opportunity 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 Good morning, two questions to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.750
 The first one I do not want to leave a little 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 the fact that it has not yet 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.100
 renewed the contract in some way 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.330
 influenced their performance in the two 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.090
 previous matches 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.890
 this one to another is the saints 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 undeniably grows when you play at home 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.260
 of the 25 goals you scored in the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.570
 championship were in the village five of these 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.450
 your what is missing for you and the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.370
 can achieve such performance out of 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.400
 already in view that the next 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.840
 duel is in the interior 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.470
 so always when you have this business of 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.710
 contract when it does not leave then I 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 I am particularly very anxious then 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.800
 I think I was getting in the way a bit 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.520
 huh 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.330
 but after the innovation came and 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.560
 believed in me 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.160
 I think it's easier for you to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.260
 work and when I play in the village I think 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.730
 the saints are very strong here in the village 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.990
 belmiro not always when we play 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.180
 here we are quite offensive have a 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.060
 very strong attack then we think 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.720
 what's the saints football here in the village 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.880
 is the main factor of java people 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.160
 realizes that the saints have regained their joy 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.530
 especially there in the attack has come out 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.420
 Goal of new commemorations 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.130
 Segovia of the little girl wanted you to 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.780
 say a little if you know 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.360
 how does it work 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.860
 I do not like it very much, no gabriel business 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.430
 I figured it pulls me and wants to make it dance. 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.590
 and abandonment packs it but I'm very 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.570
 more concrete can celebrate to lift 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.510
 a brush thanks to God Himself and one more 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.740
 team pulled and ends up always doing it 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:09.650
 I was reading when I left important. 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:11.720
 celebrate in a game in which the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.370
 secret of the santos attack and has already 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.710
 sometimes thrashed the championship by 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.570
 the style of play that asks for osvaldo 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.260
 You up there in front of me without the ball. 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.520
 That I can reveal it a lot, right? 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.800
 but I think it's 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.509
 the egypt that osvaldo leave freer 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.940
 to play without the ball you have to score 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.620
 everyone is and with the ball is the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 drive in the front has to happen 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.699
 independent to prance on the left in 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.729
 right then I think this is the 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.379
 main we like leaving during the 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.300
 championship you had three players 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.430
 playing centrally in place of the 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.039
 montijo right that centerpiece in the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.449
 in the middle of the three shipowners 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.690
 each of them has characteristic 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.099
 different that what changes from one 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.080
 to the other because from now on 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.030
 it may be that the gabriel is that piece 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.190
 and no longer the cycere changes much with 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.550
 gabriel does not change in relation to what the 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.139
 what does this look like at all? 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.830
 all three have different styles of play 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.889
 Are you more fond of this game? 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.080
 the gabriel is not more aggressive up 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.380
 and moves a lot so I think 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:23.030
 opens the line that the input of 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.490
 Gabriel helped a lot but that is 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.349
 entering the games so he helped 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.830
 with the fundamental piece in the 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.419
 attack the game you will now start to 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.370
 to be compared or neymar 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.620
 This bothers you and one of you as far as 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.590
 Do you think that you will arrive with the player? 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.719
 I think the comparison is not neymar 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.090
 neymar anema and giovana or giovana acho 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.469
 that I have it all just at the beginning of my 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.020
 career has too much to happen 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:53.590
 I still hope to continue working 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.590
 strong
