00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.920
 all right 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.510
 very good and castrating minecraft for 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.549
 bring a new prowein craft 1.7 point 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.480
 10 called light bugs could with forge 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.369
 so you do not want to download it 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 install it and what this mode brings us 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.240
 it is this base we have right here 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.829
 below what it does is bring us 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.230
 objects that we can find in 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.910
 any damage but within a 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.650
 sachet then how does it work 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.090
 simply by giving the right click and 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.559
 that we find the objects that we have 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.540
 inside as you see here we have meat 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.360
 rotten arrows and pearls from which 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.650
 we can easily find damage 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.469
 here for example we have another little bag 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.870
 with arrows and one iron is by 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.480
 example then it has a variant of things 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.219
 ok and here we have and this is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.930
 the sword we are going to see here in this 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.219
 part and put me here is that 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.469
 Of course I have five bags that I have put 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.359
 at random for you to see but of course 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.910
 this is what it has worth then 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.079
 apart from being able to find them in chests 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.550
 of daniels that we can find 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.469
 easily between a damage eater too 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.410
 to have more things then we can 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.479
 find them by killing both friendly and 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.060
 masters offensive to any kind of way 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.679
 friendly and offensive then this is 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 I 'm going to take it off I'm going to start putting 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.009
 for example zombies is worth more in the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.030
 example that I will take and I will kill 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.310
 zombies until the wall 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.520
 anyways the quick spawn the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.290
 European retirement is very high then I 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.909
 I think every five zombies that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.400
 we keep something like this one brings us a 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.619
 bag then it 's pretty sitting I've 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.740
 killed two just like that leaves me a liar 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.479
 but I hope not to see let's see in 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.090
 this case has not given me the bag either 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.810
 again to see little the little one and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 bennati I will remove the position either 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.259
 this is going to be the fifth and if the fifth 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.140
 novelda since as a liar come 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.240
 let's move on to this one 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.520
 well well veiled the fifth but 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.260
 I really invented but more or less 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.080
 according to what I had seen before 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.670
 but the same thing has worked the thing is in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.700
 this case has brought me a mature of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.009
 iron for horse some arrows bread and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 apple and the issue is that for example the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.640
 objects that we have here we can 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 download them to the inventory is worth but we do not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.220
 serves this bag to store objects 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 because if I for example and ted or 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.510
 save it up here now I do not 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.940
 leave then once the bag is 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 empty as all of you will understand the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.040
 bag is ready to be thrown because it has already 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 been for nothing 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.959
 today it is pulled alone efe has overtaken me 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 to thoughts well let's go 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.530
 now to put pigs will notice pigs 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 which also have the same ratio 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 invented by me but it works 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.989
 Well first and as you see 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.550
 we have a label here to remove them 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.140
 Well, the stock market also disappears 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 pretty cool this way of being is 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.160
 very handsome the truth I do not know how 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.570
 how to explain it but that is to say that banesto 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.510
 have made great great truth that 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.280
 They have worked a lot and I think it's cool 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.230
 enough to do series and so on 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.270
 because as well as that you get objects 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.220
 before they advance a lot of time and 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.690
 I do not know I think he's handsome he was for the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.190
 can find bags and say today to 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.520
 see what's in the pouch is cool 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.570
 it's cool 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.430
 Well, so I hope there has been a 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.260
 heap this video I know if you can like 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.820
 new favorites in the next video and 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.820
