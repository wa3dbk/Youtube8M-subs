unreliable in some ways but in others

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.420 
unreliable in some ways but in others
it's<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.289> consistent<00:01:57.770> removal<00:01:58.159> as<00:01:58.280> your

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
it's a consistent removal as your

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.620 
it's a consistent removal as your

and<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.289> very<00:02:00.560> thing<00:02:00.829> preventing<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.280> from

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and the very thing preventing it from

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
and the very thing preventing it from
swinging<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:02.000> making<00:02:02.450> its<00:02:02.570> carrier<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
swinging is making its carrier and
