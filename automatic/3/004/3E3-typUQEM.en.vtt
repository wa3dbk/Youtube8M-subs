00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
range why this is so useful in inferno

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.479 
range why this is so useful in inferno
is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> times<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.039> get

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is that a lot of times you can get

is that a lot of times you can get
surrounded<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.180> easily<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.350> make

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
surrounded very easily if you just make

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.920 
surrounded very easily if you just make
one<00:01:01.800> miss<00:01:02.070> click<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:03.030> you're<00:01:03.180> hiding<00:01:03.600> elite

champs around and then if you get
surrounded<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:07.140> die<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
run away just a few feet and that hit

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.679 
run away just a few feet and that hit
stand<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> attack<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.970> two<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.479> three

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689

stand to attack and do two or three
attacks<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.860> I'll<00:01:23.070> run<00:01:23.340> away<00:01:23.490> again<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
attacks and then I'll run away again and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.149 
attacks and then I'll run away again and
this<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.200> helps<00:01:25.590> me<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.979> get

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this really really helps me not get

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
this really really helps me not get
surrounded<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> gives<00:01:27.030> me<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> clear<00:01:27.540> path

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
surrounded and it gives me a clear path

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
surrounded and it gives me a clear path
to<00:01:28.049> keep<00:01:28.320> hiding<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.400> also<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.939> complete

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
to keep hiding and also I have complete

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
to keep hiding and also I have complete
control<00:01:30.450> over<00:01:30.720> where<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.229> character<00:01:31.290> goes<00:01:31.979> I'm

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
control over where my character goes I'm

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.310 
control over where my character goes I'm
not<00:01:32.820> clicking<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> mob<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> game

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
not clicking on a mob and then the game

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550 
not clicking on a mob and then the game
is<00:01:34.400> deciding<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.490> path<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.119> me<00:01:36.350> I've<00:01:37.350> also

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is deciding a path for me I've also

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
is deciding a path for me I've also
found<00:01:37.680> deadly<00:01:38.310> reach<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.180> useful

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
found deadly reach to be really useful

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
found deadly reach to be really useful
when<00:01:39.810> kiting<00:01:40.229> especially<00:01:40.740> using<00:01:40.950> Stan<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
when kiting especially using Stan and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.210 
when kiting especially using Stan and
attack<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.299> its<00:01:42.630> attack<00:01:43.049> range<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> lot

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
attack because its attack range is a lot

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.179 
attack because its attack range is a lot
longer<00:01:44.570> longer<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> good<00:01:46.799> word<00:01:46.979> isn't
