00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.189
 hi friends and jorge to steal and this in 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.419
 a video response that is a video 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.710
 answer the video answers are 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.120
 answers he made in the format of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.740
 video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 to questions they ask me through the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 email or through 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 our social networks like youtube 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.779
 facebook or twitter because for me I think 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 which is better explained in videos 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 so much text that it can be a little more 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 messes and since it looks and understands a lot 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.670
 better in this question in balance to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 through email they ask me about 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.350
 fuel of both pills and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.290
 alcohol asks me which of them two 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.240
 they have a higher calorific value than 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.890
 the two formats of auto pills as 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.290
 the alcohol 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.120
 Hold more has a longer duration 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.789
 in that evil utensils 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 in this he asks me about pills and 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.460
 alcohol but I'm going to put a third 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.469
 element that maybe is not so 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 known that is the fuel gel already 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.010
 which is similar and so he asks me 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.500
 I think you're looking for the kind of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 alcohol stoves something more then 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 little one you do not want to find me at last and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.720
 gas and gas is worth the first question 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.360
 which of them have greater power 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.100
 calorific very well the manufacturers do not 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.320
 they have a table made of what is the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.210
 calorific value in kilocalories or in 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.490
 bÃ©ticos since that would have to be 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.220
 calculate the higher calorific value 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 dump a different calorific value 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.060
 that the engineers and everyone will know 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.410
 much more would have to calculate what 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.179
 you would have to do these tests with a 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.770
 calorimeter since more done this forgiveness 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.780
 I can study how to calculate it 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.960
 we have another option that is that of I think 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.789
 that the lifelong catch the stove 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 with the pill as he does them and 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.460
 take a pot of half a liter and calculate 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.460
 how long it takes and so 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 also more or less the manufacturer yes that 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 this one comes 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 a temperature table for example the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.010
 The manufacturer's pill is to see the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.479
 we have the format of 14 grams that to me 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.000
 I like it a lot because it's worth a pack 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.020
 Individually everything heats a pot 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 of half a liter of water in seven minutes 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.350
 then we would have another one that goes in this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.680
 box that are 4 grams but they go in 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.860
 format so individualized do not go in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.350
 borrowed like this one here with two 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.489
 pills two parties approximately 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.290
 five minutes we will heat 250 thousand I have 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.060
 informant that next here 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 about 8 or 10 days we will receive from 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.340
 international bcb manufacturer a new 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.350
 pills some new items that do not 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.209
 I have them I have not tried them we have 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.090
 quantified I'm putting you here a 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.760
 little bit the information the graph 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.440
 to see how it looks like it has very 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.060
 good views anyway under 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.250
 my YouTube channel where the video is 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.730
 to the in the description of the video you have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.780
 link in a post that commented on this 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.390
 type of match 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.800
 we talked about the pill we would talk about 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.080
 with alcohol 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.090
 here the typical screws I have removed 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.770
 this brass on the website we have 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 of different models in titanium 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.100
 etcetera in which we can use 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.630
 use or alcor of 96 degrees or al 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.930
 cleaning collector with which 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.430
 Ladybug approximately how can you 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.440
 see here in this video so warm up 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.350
 well that half a liter of water in about 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 how many minutes right now like wind 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.910
 I'm going to put it here and you can see the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.470
 video of which I have made this one 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.740
 stove making a 7 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.690
 alcohol just another time is not going to 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.460
 last so long that depends on what 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.040
 fill the container with we will take the 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.380
 container for more time will be in 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.900
 combustion and more more time is not going to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.260
 last if we miss little will cost us 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.810
 here is here either there is no table 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.310
 also all this the circumstances are 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.730
 where it makes always go to 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.960
 use 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.730
 At what temperature are we going to use it? 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.220
 here to the title we will use then 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.560
 also influences at higher altitude how 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.090
 is that the bodies perform less too 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.230
 this can not leave a bit of today and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.520
 also if you have to sell all this 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.080
 time these are combustible 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.760
 needing a component that would be the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.230
 oxygen to mix it to make the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.060
 good combustion 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.250
 well, here I can not either 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.980
 explain a specific table of how much 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.320
 this video may last 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.660
 made from here 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.650
 well, if you see that you get too much 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.900
 or comfortable jim with alcohol you can 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.840
 relax with a little water that I put you 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.230
 the indications of the part of both 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.420
 alcohol as good as water me here 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.920
 I have two alcohol of 96 and alcohol of 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.440
 cleaning I've done proof text of 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.700
 all forms then here in the channel there will be 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.230
 a lot more people have to use another 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.600
 type of alcohol so you can not 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.360
 comment if you lower it with water do not 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.830
 rebate with water or with a stand works 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.570
 another fuel that would be this 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.640
 fuel that we have made 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.130
 Tests can be used perfectly 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.710
 in these brass stoves how can you 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.980
 appreciate in the video I have done it for 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.690
 example in the gel fuel not 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.880
 I have made a time table when 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.280
 he said he gave me to prove it he would have to 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.090
 have chosen to know a little and have 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.970
 put half a liter 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.850
 as soon as it heats up but yes I can 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.940
 say that more or less the pills the 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.940
 alcohol and this will approximately be 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.870
 the same between 67 minutes 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.630
 Eight or ten minutes was more expensive 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.940
 need a little more you are going to be there 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.950
 everything depends on the speed of things 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.580
 the fence you can appreciate in the table is 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.129
 very clean works very well has a 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.619
 wall more blue 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.999
 this here I put the table so that the 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:42.339
 see the graph of the yields 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.409
 maybe I can not tell you the power 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.769
 calorific that has works very well 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.650
 in this container you are taking it out is a 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:52.919
 container that is 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.259
 they press the sacks and it works very well 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.000
 It is reusable, which is how good it is 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.750
 reusable you can take it back to the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.130
 center etc. 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.350
 I hope that you have information before 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.230
 helped in any way but to 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.270
 the people of the community to search and 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.390
 survival of fer place that good pos 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.220
 help them too and everything you have 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.690
 made tests with different fuel 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.690
 what do you think of a greeting
