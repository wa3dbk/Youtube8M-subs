video is i rarely find glitches myself I

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.530 
video is i rarely find glitches myself I
know<00:00:13.769> bitches<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.089> I've<00:00:15.179> done<00:00:15.330> them<00:00:15.450> before

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
know bitches and I've done them before

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.050 
know bitches and I've done them before
but<00:00:15.980> usually<00:00:16.980> something<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.640> somebody<00:00:17.880> show

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but usually something that somebody show

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.570 
but usually something that somebody show
me<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.480> already<00:00:18.869> put<00:00:19.020> online<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
me or already put online and this I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.010 
me or already put online and this I
discovered<00:00:20.939> myself<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> figured<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.900> was

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
discovered myself so I figured it was

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
discovered myself so I figured it was
worth<00:00:22.050> taking<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.010> credit<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.670> haven't

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
worth taking the credit for I haven't

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.509 
worth taking the credit for I haven't
seen<00:00:24.300> anybody<00:00:24.510> else<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.869> yet<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.400> plus<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
seen anybody else do it yet and plus I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.950 
seen anybody else do it yet and plus I
think<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> cool<00:00:27.119> most<00:00:27.390> glitches

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
think it's kind of cool most glitches

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
think it's kind of cool most glitches
that<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.369> can't<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.849> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to this wall object is to hang from this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.290 
to this wall object is to hang from this
wall<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:20.400> here

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300
