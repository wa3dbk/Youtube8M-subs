00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.490 

well<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.879> way<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> works<00:00:49.359> is<00:00:49.660> take<00:00:50.140> strength

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
well the way it works is take strength

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.619 
well the way it works is take strength
from<00:00:50.649> her<00:00:51.039> other<00:00:51.280> senses<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:52.180> repair<00:00:52.510> the
