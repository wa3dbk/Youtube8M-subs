00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
spots put just fence post I think it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
spots put just fence post I think it
just<00:00:52.320> adds<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.710> bit<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:53.039> detail<00:00:53.550> sort

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of connects to the uh you know log like

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
of connects to the uh you know log like
the<00:00:57.660> end<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> log<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> logs

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the end of the log and then on the logs

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.310 
the end of the log and then on the logs
that<00:00:59.820> are<00:00:59.879> facing<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.660> put<00:01:00.750> fence<00:01:00.989> posts

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that are facing up just put fence posts

and<00:01:01.440> bring<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.520> high<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and bring them to high because it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.880 
and bring them to high because it's
going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> hold<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> roof<00:01:04.500> they're<00:01:04.710> just

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going to hold up the roof they're just

support<00:01:05.189> beams<00:01:05.430> look<00:01:05.700> cool<00:01:05.909> next<00:01:06.659> fill<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
support beams look cool next fill in the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.179 
support beams look cool next fill in the
the<00:01:08.340> inside<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.930> bar<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.380> circle<00:01:10.830> with

the inside of the bar or the circle with
stone<00:01:11.880> brick<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> changes<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> up

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
stone brick just kind of changes it up

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
stone brick just kind of changes it up
gives<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> nice<00:01:14.220> texture<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:14.909> already

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
gives it a nice texture I've already

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
gives it a nice texture I've already
I've<00:01:15.600> went<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.170> rants<00:01:16.439> before<00:01:16.860> while<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> like

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I've went on rants before while I like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
I've went on rants before while I like
using<00:01:17.520> stone<00:01:17.880> brick<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.210> floors<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
using stone brick as floors I think it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
using stone brick as floors I think it
makes<00:01:18.930> most<00:01:19.170> sense<00:01:19.290> next<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> spots

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
makes most sense next in all the spots

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
makes most sense next in all the spots
that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.030> place<00:01:21.240> redstone<00:01:21.479> torches<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.439> dig

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that I place redstone torches just dig

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
that I place redstone torches just dig
down<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:23.070> spots<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.729> torch<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.479> you're

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
down two spots put torch then you're

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
down two spots put torch then you're
going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> put<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.680> redstone<00:01:26.250> lamp<00:01:26.580> over<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
going to put a redstone lamp over it you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.819 
going to put a redstone lamp over it you
can<00:01:27.479> use<00:01:27.570> glowstone<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.200> whatever<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.990 
can use glowstone or whatever you want I
just<00:01:29.040> use<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> lighting

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just use it because I like the lighting

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
just use it because I like the lighting
of<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.570> looks<00:01:30.720> cool<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.710> I'll<00:01:31.799> do

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
of it I think it looks cool so I'll do

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
of it I think it looks cool so I'll do
something<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.329> kinda

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
something like that now it just kinda

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.969 
something like that now it just kinda
has<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> nice<00:01:34.020> pattern<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.740> overall

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
has a nice pattern to it at overall

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
has a nice pattern to it at overall
looks<00:01:35.220> cool<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> stone<00:01:35.790> brick<00:01:36.060> turns<00:01:36.720> into

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
looks cool the stone brick turns into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719 
looks cool the stone brick turns into
this<00:01:37.140> cool<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> design<00:01:38.040> when<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> fly<00:01:38.700> up

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this cool sort of design when I fly up

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
this cool sort of design when I fly up
