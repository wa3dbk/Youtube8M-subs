 friends of adam installed the developer preview of windows 8 some fairy 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.099
 day ago by microsoft or on a tablet all the production of Collepardo photos 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.640
 that 500d acer 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.699
 midi file compressor then platform x8 six 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.010
 but we immediately see how the new peace features of this version are 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.410
 new windows ante star screen also welcome us at computer startup 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.660
 to unlock it as sui and smarzfon 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 halen audio sound 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.550
 I scroll to the other and the classic login screen disappears 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.870
 play without our user this is the interface that all users 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.830
 will see on windows 8 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 has been started but also on desktop 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.460
 through two slots and in fact pat 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.590
 legacy from 1 sponsee bennet the metro interface 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.260
 so this is a tile 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.150
 and yet if we combine the desktop or traditional version then we have a helmet 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.420
 control panel and we can launch all applications and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 what clothes to say about windows in this normal desktop environment 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.230
 the user, however, will find himself starting with this one 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.240
 interface then a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.070
 a 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.159
 a sort of problem for those who still use a mouse and keyboard 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.380
 problem that is paradoxically for out of most utd when we open a 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 application from the interface meter to 1 people however that is not optimized for 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.560
 this scapriot application interface is full screen 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 if you had in the text version 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.369
 take a look at those on some of the features of this new one 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.689
 microsoft operating system. we find cosenza interet explorer 10 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 equalization I find 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 full screen optimized for packshot 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.940
 we see that the pincetto dunbar is also very fluid 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.870
 active formentere 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.680
 the only note the buffa if we want also missing flash art 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.740
 flash is a better flash and and all others on page 3 this version 3 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.190
 integrated back does not support any kind of me but rests 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.750
 exclusively html5 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 and other scripting technologies is integrated into the browser 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.510
 so obviously, however, to the desktop version of intra and explore 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.329
 supports flash perfectly and then beltrame insert 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.840
 an address yes tickets also made as the identical screen keyboard 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 especially those I don't know if 20 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.759
 even here, of course, we are cooked. Interista I will accept flash except 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.719
 so or this duality that actually is a bit strange al 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.369
 and never seen justifies with the fact that the absence of a page should improve 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.719
 browser compatibility and above all durability 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.119
 of the battery 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.149
 with we said operating system is optimized for her many taxis and therefore 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:57.030
 many chalk are new to this environment 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.529
 present we can re move the various 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 file tiles 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.000
 torrent also redesigned control panel we have 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.980
 not if you laugh at new functions and summer even when it's interface 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.299
 meter 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.769
 we can entirely change the art of the screen or directly in the 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.269
 image of the user 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.609
 streaming tv series 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.680
 new features such as the ability to share content or one 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.499
 directly the desktop screen on social networks like twitter 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.760
 integrated in brands tweeter 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.119
 feisbuk 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:47.559
 for all other solutions people must be sent back to the panel of 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.559
 traditional control 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.019
 briquettes like a shake are known to be active so we have the 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.029
 news change within the treatment of Ukrainian here we see the 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:01.779
 weather 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.350
 stock indices and rss feeds 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.339
 the rest is also made of tiles here 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.949
 ratchet the title and subtitle 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:14.269
 if present instead it is an image in this is ramos tratar directly 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 in the tile 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.750
 I still have both interesting and present management starting from the left of the 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:27.770
 screen 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.680
 it is possible to cycle between the various and open windows 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.990
 in this world 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.270
 it starts from the bottom but other functions go through, for example in the browser la 

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:46.300
 possibility to open the window or delete existing requests insert a 

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:48.060
 new Palermo address 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.770
 or even add add 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.439
 the site among the favorites 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.629
 the right spy instead we have the party to return to the start menu and a

 duplicate of the start button already present trade of notifications in this 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.659
 case the signal strength voir les know is the battery time and date as 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.659
 classic brico in the bottom right of windows 8 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.319
 we can also find by doing a search within the system 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.599
 disputed operational we see the list of all applications 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.930
 there being no pyo. clothes the farewell button or been between us and dreams 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.949
 coding window actually moved 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.159
 this place 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.169
 even if then how to see many savory applications come 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.990
 the idea of ​​added preperation added a tile in the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.199
 homescreen 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.050
 mission can also share one 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.050
 - a screen of the third stabilizing 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.189
 or 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.870
 connect to an external device this other ecid on offer at civita 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.639
 project a device connected via a tower onto a projector 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.639
 port cd and never what we are viewing 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.800
 and 7 months instead we have stars the basic functions to govern the tablet 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.729

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.259
 audio volume the brightness of the adjusted coiffeur screen 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.529
 very easily 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.729
 from the typical served I wanted to disable them 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.819
 and paolo ie 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.499
 amandalist slip dresses turn it off or restart it 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.070
 by inserting an ursi key, plates directly explore resources 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.199
 however in its desktop version 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.289
 if we want something after this the main problem of windows 8 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.740
 over the stars integration between the nitro environment optimized for 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.149
 been very nice to use even if it was impractical for the environment 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:58.930
 desktop and desktop environment of its own that still remain an importance 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.689
 quite relevant in windows 8 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.449
 this vespanda perhaps will not be very welcome to seriously dismiss who 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.860
 we will have to wait to see the final version ever understand how the public 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.159
 will react to this new operating system 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.370
 at the moment they don't know what to wait 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.000
