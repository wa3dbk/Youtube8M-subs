00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.050
 The trend for us is just being honest with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 it takes to start sharing with the repair 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.670
 parts professionals 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 honestly the transformer also advise it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.279
 printer that are flapping the the trend 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.940
 it is fair that people benefit 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.320
 to have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.760
 have not sold long term 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.050
 but you have a good printer for 10 years 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.050
 also use the duration 17 years 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 the branch of was becoming increasingly cleaner 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 the ashes have been burned stable mats 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 environmentally friendly where no gasoline 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.380
 sit always has what is for the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.380
 product good I imagine good for humans 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.920
 arthur spangen since the spring 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.480
 but the complete new ranger 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.140
 battery machines are under one 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 chainsaw 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.800
 hedge trimmer forest but a printer it 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.360
 major advantage of a battery machine 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.280
 gasoline powered 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.199
 machines therefore the emission 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.479
 you do not emit the less noise 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.479
 less maintenance costs in the vibrations 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 the old mill actually has none 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.070
 maintenance required 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 i clean you i believe them completely 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.400
 after 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.410
 to the computer new more massive and and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.850
 though security malfunctions can be noah 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.260
 now back to evil 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.100
 so we are right in the middle of where we try 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.100
 to clap 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 sustainability is a whole for our company 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.460
 very important for the elderly themselves 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.710
 take into account 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.720
 it's with those little machines that is 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.460
 very nice that but with that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 bigger they are as far as this but we are 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.220
 busy doing that anyway 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.420
 to get together 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.680
 well our company is also a formula 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.140
 Companies have clarity about it 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.140
 family businesses and to the sire 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.770
 the formula is just good products 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.180
 to deliver 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.920
 honest advice the products must 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.020
 have a bit of nasa there with 10 years after 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.489
 gondola and that customer for 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.640
 the customer at not for him at all already 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.640
 four years 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.930
 we went to act the court really 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.930
 thorough proof is here
