everything on graph paper then I can

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339 
everything on graph paper then I can

that pictures which in this case or of a

that pictures which in this case or of a
house<00:00:36.260> there's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> particular<00:00:38.090> famous<00:00:39.090> tree

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
house there's a particular famous tree

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
house there's a particular famous tree
at<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.079> house<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
at this house which you can see on the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.049 
at this house which you can see on the
left<00:00:42.110> it's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.260> giant<00:00:43.500> well<00:00:43.890> Antonio<00:00:44.250> tree<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
left it's a giant well Antonio tree I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
left it's a giant well Antonio tree I
think<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.649> probably<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
think it's about it's probably the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
think it's about it's probably the
tallest<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> contrary<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:47.940> fact<00:00:48.110> there

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
tallest in the contrary in fact there

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.970 
tallest in the contrary in fact there
are<00:00:49.140> mountains<00:00:49.710> behind<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.430> house<00:00:51.860> trying<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
are mountains behind the house trying to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
are mountains behind the house trying to
get<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.160> effect<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
get that effect here and this was the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
get that effect here and this was the
early<00:00:57.570> attempt<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.820> made<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.030> three

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
early attempt we are made about three

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110 
early attempt we are made about three
and<00:01:00.420> three<00:01:01.140> attempts<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.460> together<00:01:02.820> there's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and three attempts all together there's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
and three attempts all together there's
two<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.600> after<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.229> looked<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
two more after this one looked at this

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.899 
two more after this one looked at this
one<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> thought<00:01:05.790> well<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:08.010> needs<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> be

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
one and I thought well it needs to be

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.929 
one and I thought well it needs to be
improved<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.170> hedge<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> front<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
improved here the hedge at the front of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
improved here the hedge at the front of
the<00:01:12.240> card<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.500> flimsy<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> made<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the card is a bit flimsy so I made that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.780 
the card is a bit flimsy so I made that
a<00:01:14.580> bit<00:01:14.729> stronger<00:01:15.060> later<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> tried<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
a bit stronger later on here I tried a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
a bit stronger later on here I tried a
blue<00:01:18.030> background<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> sky<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.680> actual

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
blue background for a sky but in actual

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
blue background for a sky but in actual
fact<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.520> fells<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> background<00:01:21.600> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
fact we have fells in the background so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.429 
fact we have fells in the background so
I'll<00:01:21.810> change<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.229> later<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.830> you'll<00:01:23.009> see

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
I'll change this later on as you'll see

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
I'll change this later on as you'll see
but<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:26.310> drew<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.119> shapes<00:01:27.650> scan<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
but I drew these shapes scan them and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.810 
but I drew these shapes scan them and
use<00:01:29.960> pins<00:01:30.960> Photoshop<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.009> flood<00:01:32.280> flood<00:01:32.700> them

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
use pins Photoshop to flood flood them

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.380 
use pins Photoshop to flood flood them
with<00:01:32.850> color

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
with color

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.270 
with color
just<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.110> get<00:01:35.260> an<00:01:35.350> idea<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.770> how<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.010> would<00:01:36.250> work

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
just to get an idea of how it would work

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980 
just to get an idea of how it would work
as<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.640> card<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.030> get<00:01:37.120> some<00:01:37.300> shadowy<00:01:37.630> effects

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
as a card you get some shadowy effects

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.060 
as a card you get some shadowy effects
at<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.290> back<00:01:38.440> there<00:01:38.620> which<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:38.890> quite

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
at the back there which is quite

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.510 
at the back there which is quite
interesting<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:41.770> developing<00:01:42.250> quite

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
interesting so it's developing quite

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.940 
interesting so it's developing quite
nicely<00:01:42.790> but<00:01:43.570> what<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.780> had<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:43.960> do<00:01:44.200> about<00:01:44.590> to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
nicely but what I had to do about to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.219 
nicely but what I had to do about to
modify<00:01:45.460> various<00:01:46.060> parts<00:01:46.510> this<00:01:46.690> part<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:47.050> two

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
modify various parts this part was two

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.899 
modify various parts this part was two
weeks<00:01:47.500> I've<00:01:47.800> really<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.040> bit<00:01:48.250> stronger<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.760> bit<00:01:48.880> a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
weeks I've really a bit stronger a bit a

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.160 
weeks I've really a bit stronger a bit a
bit<00:01:49.090> bigger<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.740> also<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:52.360> long<00:01:52.869> piece

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
bit bigger and also the the long piece

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.540 
bit bigger and also the the long piece
of<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.410> front<00:01:53.650> I've<00:01:53.800> made<00:01:54.009> that<00:01:54.220> little<00:01:54.369> bit

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
of the front I've made that little bit

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.210 
of the front I've made that little bit
different<00:01:54.910> I've<00:01:55.450> also<00:01:55.630> vaulted<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.350> crease

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
different I've also vaulted this crease

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.980 
different I've also vaulted this crease
here<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.259> new<00:01:59.409> background<00:01:59.650> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
here and this is the new background and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.210 
here and this is the new background and
putting<00:02:01.990> all<00:02:02.080> these<00:02:02.229> things<00:02:02.530> together<00:02:02.740> it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
putting all these things together it's

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.010 
putting all these things together it's
starting<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.790> look<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.970> bit<00:02:04.119> better<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.869> is

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
starting to look a bit better so this is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080 
starting to look a bit better so this is
I'm<00:02:05.890> not<00:02:06.100> cutting<00:02:06.310> out<00:02:06.520> for<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.789> what<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:06.940> was

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
I'm not cutting out for it what I was

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.469 
I'm not cutting out for it what I was
just<00:02:07.240> testing<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:08.039> there<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.759> and

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
just testing it there it is that and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.479 
just testing it there it is that and
it's<00:02:10.630> something<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.989> guests<00:02:11.590> who<00:02:11.980> go<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
it's something that guests who go to the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's something that guests who go to the
house<00:02:12.670> could<00:02:13.030> perhaps<00:02:13.860> while<00:02:14.860> away<00:02:15.220> sometime

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
house could perhaps while away sometime

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
house could perhaps while away sometime
if<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.360> an<00:02:16.930> evening<00:02:17.260> or<00:02:17.680> idea<00:02:18.070> where<00:02:18.250> it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
if it's an evening or idea where it's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.800 
if it's an evening or idea where it's
reading<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.880> something<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.630> couldn't

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
reading of something that couldn't

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.240 
reading of something that couldn't
perhaps<00:02:20.050> some<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.769> little<00:02:20.950> play<00:02:21.100> with

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
perhaps some have a little play with

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.740 
perhaps some have a little play with
this<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.519> remember<00:02:21.610> when<00:02:22.360> they<00:02:22.480> were<00:02:22.510> there

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
this and remember when they were there

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.080 
this and remember when they were there
and<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.260> see<00:02:24.000> here's<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and here you can see here's the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.640 
and here you can see here's the
finishing<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.440> farmer<00:02:27.130> girl<00:02:27.280> stage
