seems to not be quite so good around the
office<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.500> let's<00:00:37.770> take<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.850> we

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
office so let's take a look at what we

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.600 
office so let's take a look at what we
can<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:40.140> connected<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> HSPA

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

network now I like to go to Cena to do
speed<00:00:45.270> tests<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> different

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
speed tests there's a lot of different

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.380 
speed tests there's a lot of different
sites<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> allow<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> do

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sites out there that allow you to do

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.860 
sites out there that allow you to do
speed<00:00:48.690> tests<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.100> ahead

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
speed tests but I'm going to go ahead

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.910 
speed tests but I'm going to go ahead
I've<00:00:51.870> got<00:00:52.170> cnet<00:00:52.620> bookmarked<00:00:53.219> call<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
I've got cnet bookmarked call it up and

I've got cnet bookmarked call it up and
as<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.699> internet<00:00:57.239> response<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
as you can see the internet response is
pretty<00:00:58.410> snappy<00:00:58.739> although<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.609> as

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
pretty snappy although it's not as

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
pretty snappy although it's not as
snappy<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.829> really

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
snappy as it could be when it's really

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.350 
snappy as it could be when it's really
zipping<00:01:02.820> along<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.449> full<00:01:04.439> HSPA<00:01:05.159> speeds<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
zipping along at full HSPA speeds but it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080 
zipping along at full HSPA speeds but it
still<00:01:06.630> says<00:01:06.900> age<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> we're<00:01:07.680> still<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.130> HSPA

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
still says age so we're still at HSPA

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.490 
still says age so we're still at HSPA
i'm<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> call<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.159> ok<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
i'm going to call this up ok this is the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
i'm going to call this up ok this is the
speed<00:01:13.500> test<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.010> seen<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> i'm<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
speed test at seen it and i'm going to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.230 
speed test at seen it and i'm going to
go<00:01:15.390> ahead<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.689> run<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
go ahead and run it it's got this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.210 
go ahead and run it it's got this
speedometer<00:01:18.479> gauge<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.409> shows<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
speedometer gauge that shows what the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.450 
speedometer gauge that shows what the
instantaneous<00:01:20.909> speed<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.830> gauge

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
instantaneous speed is and this gauge

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
instantaneous speed is and this gauge
over<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.970> indicates<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.630> done<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> test<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
over here indicates how done the test is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.910 
over here indicates how done the test is
so<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:27.060> forty<00:01:27.869> percent<00:01:27.900> done<00:01:28.619> right

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so it's about forty percent done right

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.210 
so it's about forty percent done right
now<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> speed<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> 800<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
now now a speed of 800 is pretty good in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
now now a speed of 800 is pretty good in
my<00:01:35.369> experience<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> cell<00:01:36.570> phone<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:37.049> even

my experience on a cell phone or even

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460 
my experience on a cell phone or even
for<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.009> aircard<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:39.119> fabulous<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.079> pretty

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
for an aircard not fabulous but pretty

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.219 
for an aircard not fabulous but pretty
good<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.150> getting<00:01:42.329> speeds<00:01:42.780> much

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
good but I was getting speeds much

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
good but I was getting speeds much
higher<00:01:43.439> than<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> Northern

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
higher than that out in the Northern

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.679 
higher than that out in the Northern

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the weekend so after this test I'm going

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.149 
the weekend so after this test I'm going
to<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> different<00:01:52.079> location<00:01:52.200> run

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

the<00:01:53.340> test<00:01:53.579> again<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the test again and see if I can get a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.740 
the test again and see if I can get a
higher<00:01:55.649> result<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> test

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
but on the g2 I know it can do a lot

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.710 
but on the g2 I know it can do a lot
better<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.790> we're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.450> get

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
better so we're going to see what I get

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.890 
better so we're going to see what I get
in<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.200> different<00:02:15.500> location<00:02:16.239> okay<00:02:17.239> now<00:02:17.450> i<00:02:17.480> am<00:02:17.870> at

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
in a different location okay now i am at

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.790 
in a different location okay now i am at
my<00:02:18.260> home<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.550> get<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> very<00:02:20.120> strong<00:02:20.800> HSPA

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
my home and I get a very strong HSPA

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.940 
my home and I get a very strong HSPA
signal<00:02:22.459> here<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.209> t-mobile<00:02:23.599> g2<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.830> I'm

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
signal here on the t-mobile g2 so I'm

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.309 
signal here on the t-mobile g2 so I'm
going<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.130> go<00:02:25.280> ahead<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:26.120> back<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.720> cnet

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
going to go ahead and go back to cnet

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to go ahead and go back to cnet
where<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:27.709> doing<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.100> testing<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.850> things

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
where I'm doing my testing and things

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.840 
where I'm doing my testing and things
are<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.830> be<00:02:30.920> loading<00:02:31.280> pretty<00:02:31.550> quickly

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
are going to be loading pretty quickly

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.720 
are going to be loading pretty quickly
now<00:02:32.780> I'm<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.319> cnet<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.920> speedometer

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:49.700 

and<00:02:40.730> we'll<00:02:41.120> start<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> test

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.200 

so<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.490> see<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> heck<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.180> lot

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
so you can see it's a heck of a lot

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.120 
so you can see it's a heck of a lot

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
that's to me that's a 4g signal so very

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.740 
that's to me that's a 4g signal so very

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
getting one bar today so the signal is a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.040 
getting one bar today so the signal is a
little<00:03:19.440> down<00:03:19.680> now<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.460> vibrant<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.390> one<00:03:21.720> of

every carrier as a galaxy s so let's see

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.100 
every carrier as a galaxy s so let's see
what<00:03:29.070> we<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.610> get<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.540> speed<00:03:30.840> test

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
what we can get here for the speed test

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.940 
what we can get here for the speed test
on<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:32.070> vibrant<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:37.890> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
on the vibrant and it's kind of

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.130 
on the vibrant and it's kind of
struggling<00:03:38.430> off<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> line<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.180> bit<00:03:40.160> as

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
struggling off the line a little bit as

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.500 
struggling off the line a little bit as
you<00:03:43.140> might<00:03:43.350> expect<00:03:43.500> from<00:03:43.950> only<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:44.850> bar<00:03:45.150> this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
you might expect from only one bar this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.860 
you might expect from only one bar this
is<00:03:45.780> as<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.620> said<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.890> 3g<00:03:47.580> phone<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> 4g<00:03:48.630> phone

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
is as I said a 3g phone not a 4g phone

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
is as I said a 3g phone not a 4g phone
so<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.740> expect<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.750> t-mobile<00:03:51.750> g2<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.500> wipe

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
so we can expect the t-mobile g2 to wipe

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.790 
so we can expect the t-mobile g2 to wipe
the<00:03:53.130> floor<00:03:53.490> with<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:54.120> samsung<00:03:54.960> vibrant<00:03:54.990> here

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
the floor with the samsung vibrant here

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.830 
the floor with the samsung vibrant here
and<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.700> certainly<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.180> way<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:57.600> going

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and that's certainly the way it's going

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.900 
and that's certainly the way it's going
I've<00:03:58.440> run<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.710> test<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.160> couple<00:03:59.400> times<00:03:59.580> today

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
I've run the test a couple times today

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.240 
I've run the test a couple times today
this<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> little<00:04:01.110> slower<00:04:01.530> than<00:04:01.830> I've<00:04:02.010> got

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
this is a little slower than I've got

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.220 
this is a little slower than I've got
for<00:04:02.970> some<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.330> other<00:04:03.480> times<00:04:03.810> I've<00:04:04.020> run<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
for some of the other times I've run the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.740 
for some of the other times I've run the
test<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.400> course<00:04:05.580> many<00:04:06.300> many

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
test there is of course many many

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.410 
test there is of course many many
variables<00:04:07.470> when<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> speed<00:04:08.820> test<00:04:09.120> like

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
variables when you do a speed test like

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.830 
variables when you do a speed test like
this<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.160> hard<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.640> make<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> judgment<00:04:12.390> on

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
this so it is hard to make a judgment on

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.710 
this so it is hard to make a judgment on
a<00:04:12.930> cell<00:04:13.920> phone<00:04:13.950> by<00:04:14.460> running<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.210> one<00:04:15.540> or<00:04:15.690> two

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
a cell phone by running just one or two

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.190 
a cell phone by running just one or two
or<00:04:16.140> even<00:04:16.170> a<00:04:16.650> half<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.400> dozen<00:04:17.580> tests<00:04:18.330> after

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
or even a half a dozen tests after

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.500 
or even a half a dozen tests after
you've<00:04:19.560> run<00:04:19.799> 10<00:04:20.070> or<00:04:20.220> 20<00:04:20.520> tests<00:04:21.030> then<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.360> get<00:04:21.480> a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
you've run 10 or 20 tests then you get a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.320
