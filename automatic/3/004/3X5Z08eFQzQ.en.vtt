 Herne 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.589
 Brady Dougan 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.589
 so people way every now and then CET 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.969
 is you measuring screen is way he is German champion is the penalty should 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.960
 later the injured 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.700
 or the ones I usually call Manhattan as Claire exotic too 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.420
 so 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.139
 insisting that he wants to play is crazy, "says Kain 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 and cheap 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.720
 I prefer not to play 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.430
 the one celebrated again is a multiplayer-game if someone angels theirs 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.260
 Walser got that too 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.610
 I think otherwise 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 two years ago her Aben 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 shoots 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 and empty 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 Schaar clear 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 it was also immediately on 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 Year provided 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 Schieszler also stays there 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 despite a slightly higher clientele part 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 Avatar in the Rada 11 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.740
 club-boss design 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.220
 go through something 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 has so far 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.279
 Albert 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.129
 Dr 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.289
 Albrecht has the mountains 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.289
 Ingenics engraved 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 Vienna is different 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.459
 there is not now 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.689
 the earthquake of the 11th 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.399
 currently power is still fun 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.519
 So at the moment, the ship does not really come yet 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.189
 At the same time, he pointed out that it is always flowing 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.189
 this happiness in the ore continues 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.189
 I know it now as three minutes 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.449
 was yes 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.249
 Announcement Suite Mio 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.569
 I predicted year 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 so surrendered 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.390
 it is not clear here 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.480
 Eigler 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 etc loud enough 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.469
 back to the topic 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.279
 easy said 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.769
 at least 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.769
 the work is 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.729
 about himself also Prof 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.629
 will be more 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.029
 Glietsch the game 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.029
 Pereira percent 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.839
 the city is currently running 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:56.629
 around 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.209
 I suppose 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 Parish churches year expires 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.889
 here yes 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.139
 at such weapons 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.139
 Beck no more than 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.489
 but 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.489
 Pretty 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.500
 if it's too late now 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.419
 really into the Joe Brown now 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.460
 various level resorts for themselves 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.900
 Change space shuttles 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.939
 likewise 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.930
 to expect that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.860
 I'm not such a person of the times but when it comes to 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.800
 boring and recorded and games of chance that are in front of the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 Country 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.139
 Dr, I'll stay 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
 I remain 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.259
 Just fork off 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 to the unequivocal 40 h -h 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.559
 of which is under permanent in the talc talc talc talc talc talc talc 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:11.669
 Berthold 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.270
 Germany is aging 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.089
 Bernd Dahlmann 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.080
 but I also believe that he stops 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 since decided 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.219
 it is too late at approx 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.219
 Vural 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.509
 the laser scanned 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.509
 on the other hand, the first signs are up to the roof 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.449
 you also have to have the publisher 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.449
 built loud 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.339
 and what would be 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.419
 and while there is some space 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.059
 but it's the same everywhere 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.839
 Backstage 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.680
 I fought like a lion 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.050
 what I mean 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.699
 and ever robbed of an op Euro 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.139
 Wacken 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.139
 I would describe it as still possible in NRW 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.830
 that's a good sign 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.220
 it's kind of like Elke Bartschat Elverdissen Strasbourg 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.939
 that comes out at but too long 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.550
 if we're bored here and keep repeating that game 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.550
 but you look at it very slowly on the wall 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 Focke u 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:50.569
 good luck 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.960
 Have Essent 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.099
 at the most 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.199
 October would be finished it would be quite 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.199
 now think of Rome 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.610
 Morche the quota 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.099
 Joops Durer 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.080
 it was very clear but agreed 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:33.729
 in the last series 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.729
 direct rally 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.680
 Wear developers familiar 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:46.529
 Finch the final boss 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.080
 I do not know what died 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.270
 b 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.559
 to 

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.559
 the road 

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.229
 the growth of the world 

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:12.720
 AP Strand 50plus and maybe we are not comfortable doing this part action 

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:17.189
 that the tourist also fog in front of Baesler is it went to me around the corner has shirts
