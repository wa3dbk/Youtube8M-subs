and what I would like to mention is that

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.730 
and what I would like to mention is that
this<00:02:04.490> weapon<00:02:04.850> has<00:02:04.999> an<00:02:05.149> impact<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.719> 97<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:06.710> of

100<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.179> absolutely<00:02:08.440> insane<00:02:09.440> if<00:02:09.740> it

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
100 now that is absolutely insane if it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
100 now that is absolutely insane if it
wasn't<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.729> charge<00:02:10.970> rate<00:02:11.150> being<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.720> slow

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
wasn't for the charge rate being so slow

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.250 
wasn't for the charge rate being so slow
I<00:02:12.470> probably<00:02:13.160> would<00:02:13.910> be<00:02:13.940> using<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.810> PvE

I probably would be using this in PvE
P<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> impact<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.849> insane<00:02:17.510> and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
P but the impact is just insane and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.110
