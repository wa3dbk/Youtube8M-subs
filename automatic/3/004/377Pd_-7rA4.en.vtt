00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.429
 well hello everyone knows 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.300
 that they envy 54 for a new 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.549
 bulk video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 let's look at this question for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.919
 today is what good do 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.900
 business 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.639
 ekin a form of scam for good 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.410
 answer this question let's look at 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 precisely the definitions make a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.980
 good deal in the world of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 collection of video games has been bought 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 a video game or console cheaper 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 than the prices charged on the internet so 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 I spent less money than if I 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 had to buy them on the internet and for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 larnack is a scam cinema and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 in our case the scam means 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 squeeze out anyone by 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 fraudulent way after which are 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.129
 these famous fraudulent way 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.239
 is it the fact of knowing that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 the person to whom a game is purchased 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 lack of knowledge in the community 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 or on the true values ​​of the games 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 videos he sells me I do not think that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.300
 it will either fraudulently has 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.489
 otherwise there would be a lot 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.719
 of scams on the internet and in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 empty attics i give you an example 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 at the empty granaries for example I wish 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 to buy here for example this game 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 boy advance tribal sp that normally 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.140
 on the prices charged on the internet in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.790
 loose 20.30 euros or 40 euros depending 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 sellers 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 I see him on a booth the person does not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 do not know its value and go 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 request 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 you give me how much then that's where 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.970
 that you have you will say to but of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 blow I can I can have it for less 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 dear I will tell him I propose you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 for 5 euros as it is as if you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.430
 have an old object an old console 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.810
 which is not so recent 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 necessarily for people 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.689
 there are people going to tell me that I 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 am a crook because I know 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 aptly its true value on 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 internet and suddenly I did not pay to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.369
 the seller at prices on 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.810
 Internet 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.030
 I do not call it naive art 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.990
 I call more I call it 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.790
 the opportunity 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 because you know everything we are all like 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 it's paying attention to the hypocrites 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.579
 we are all close to our door 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 currency and if we can make the slightest 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.220
 economy 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 when you buy things, you do it 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.719
 limit all the time and a second 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.210
 example when a work colleague 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.340
 offers a retro gaming look of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.320
 sick and pouts and asks us 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.229
 well I do not know how much I can 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 sell I wanted to draw well between 50 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.379
 and 100 euros 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.410
 So if you offer him 75 euros 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.020
 are you 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.400
 the arnacoeur not necessarily since wanted 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.720
 you enter this into his 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.040
 objective ie they 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 wanted to shoot between 50 and 100 euros 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.330
 cut you off at the 115 you 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.460
 maybe give them 100 euros 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.990
 even 50 euros if you really have a 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.610
 big stingy but suddenly is what you 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.110
 are a hustler because you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.070
 know the true value 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.720
 the lot in question 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.040
 that's when we can ask ourselves 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.750
 second question in this video 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.140
 what is the true value of a game 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 video 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 it's hard to answer that 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.440
 question since compared to the bands 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 drawn on the absence of a guide 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.550
 of different quotations from 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.320
 video games it must also be said that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.800
 it is a very recent market the retro 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.970
 gaming 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 we can perhaps rely on 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.680
 different rating sites available 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.380
 on the internet like for example mr game 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.240
 price but I do not agree too much 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.160
 compared to these people that these are 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.620
 again third people who 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.730
 do not necessarily know that they do not 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.010
 are not really passionate about games 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.240
 video that decide from the day to 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.520
 next day and they decided 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.990
 to increase certain quotations by 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.210
 relation to supply demand 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.890
 me it's not really a great example 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.360
 that I can advise 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.910
 and then besides there are some 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 quotes that are squarely to the west 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.910
 in both directions ie on 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.830
 mister gay pride had some 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.150
 quotes that is they are not at 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.160
 day because you can find less 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.050
 expensive on the internet and vice versa it's 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.780
 while we can apply the famous 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.740
 rule of supply and demand for 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.810
 know what is the true value of a 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.610
 video game that is to say that we take again 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.730
 the example of the game boy advance sp 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.970
 there are 10 available on the internet 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.520
 for that only for five buyers 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.220
 potential and ben necessarily the offer is 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.800
 higher than the demand so necessarily 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.720
 various vendors will try dice 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.120
 to sell it as cheaply as possible for 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.590
 to be able to sell their products 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.790
 so low buyers it's all good 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980
 for them because suddenly they have 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.010
 the embarrassment of choice but if in the case 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.320
 where we only have didier bellens 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.540
 tribal tribal country be fit for Thursday 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.250
 bullshit 100 interested people 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.760
 that's the demand that's stronger 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.010
 that the offer 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.560
 and inevitably we know about the same 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.690
 system only for ebay auctions 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.479
 if there are fewer offers than demand 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.780
 not be to whoever will put the 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.240
 more 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.650
 robin ton who can own this object 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.070
 that's the rule of supply and 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.750
 request 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.980
 that's when we can focus on 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.690
 another question in this video 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.950
 some youtuber was clearly put 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.690
 the points on the i versus those 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.620
 here and I can understand them they 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.720
 manage the offer 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.790
 me what I personally think and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.010
 unfortunately this is a bit the case for 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.810
 the retro gaming and well I think that 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.389
 it's a lot of resellers who 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.070
 are looking for closed and controlled this 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.350
 famous market by buying everything that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.400
 is available on the net at a derisory price 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.870
 I manage everything available at a price 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.700
 derisory by the stuff that's more 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.990
 ultra expensive it does not interest me by 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.760
 example when they go to buy on the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.650
 good corner in mass low elsewhere you 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.120
 could have certainly noticed it on 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.100
 my videos the trolls have good corners 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.930
 and suddenly they sell at prices 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.630
 exorbitant so that people who do not 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.010
 know nothing must be based on this 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.620
 market that is to say that suddenly these 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.370
 famous dealers decides with their 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.490
 exorbitant price offers to make 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.720
 vary the famous games rating 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.270
 video is it is they who go 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.160
 decide how much will sell some 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.510
 games because if we take the example of the 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.270
 game boy tribal zs 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.040
 there are 5 2 available so 4 that is 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.250
 sold by resellers who sell it 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.990
 60 euros 70 80 euros so 60 euros 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.720
 minimum up to 150 euros 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.720
 these cases that is it exists everywhere on 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.190
 internet you have some offers this 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.020
 that's not why it's so expensive 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.240
 reached some stuff but the fifth 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.770
 vendor of this console is not a 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.289
 reseller like the others he sells this 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.140
 console 10 euros and well if it is not 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.850
 one in collector buyers or a 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.410
 lambda buyer who decides to buy it 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.880
 necessarily it is the reseller who will 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.090
 buy to be able to resell it to his 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.220
 price is necessarily the this console that 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.470
 was offered at 10 euros by another 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.440
 dealer down he really goes we can 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.090
 to be available not available 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.590
 a long time on the internet because it's going to be 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.510
 bought back by their seller who goes their 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.070
 sell a lot more expensive I remember 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.270
 also that this opinion is to life 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.010
 personal in relation to the management of 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.930
 the offer by the internet resellers 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.419
 in the end to conclude this famous 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.520
 question is it's me the scammer 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.390
 which is what they are trying to do 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.400
 good business in the attics 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.680
 or by buying games from colleagues 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.220
 at low price compared to offers 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.330
 Internet 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.979
 but are not they 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.460
 his famous sellers who are the 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.250
 crooks by putting 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.750
 their games at very high prices since that 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.430
 it's a form of scam because 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.930
 do not know what is the true value
