to run by and fall into his little

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
to run by and fall into his little
chamber<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.870> guess<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.379> yeah<00:00:49.980> that's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
chamber and then guess what yeah that's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.319 
chamber and then guess what yeah that's
how<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.020> roll<00:00:52.460> well<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
how they that's how they roll well you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
how they that's how they roll well you
can't<00:00:54.570> trap<00:00:54.870> moles<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> breeding<00:00:55.620> chamber

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
can't trap moles in a breeding chamber

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090 
can't trap moles in a breeding chamber
it's<00:00:56.370> almost<00:00:57.000> impossible<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.199> dig<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
it's almost impossible to dig down and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.270 
it's almost impossible to dig down and
find<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.170> it's<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
find it and it's all as well it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
find it and it's all as well it's
impossible<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> catch<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.570> there

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
impossible to catch them in there

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.969 
impossible to catch them in there
there's<00:01:03.899> nowhere<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.470> set<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> trap

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
there's nowhere you can set a trap

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.030 
there's nowhere you can set a trap
you've<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.330> straightaway<00:01:07.040> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
chambers are not to be trapped on what

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
chambers are not to be trapped on what
you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.740> stomp<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you can do is you can stomp them down a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
you can do is you can stomp them down a
little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.409> the

little bit just to you know make the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
little bit just to you know make the
damage<00:01:16.950> less<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:18.180> still<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.720> take<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
damage less just still you can take a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.340 
damage less just still you can take a
shovel<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> scoop<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.070> dirt<00:01:20.250> away

what<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> recommend<00:01:23.009> doing<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.630> looking<00:01:24.630> around

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
what I recommend doing is looking around

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
what I recommend doing is looking around
in<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.650> spots<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:27.110> over<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> doubt

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
in other spots right over there I doubt

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
in other spots right over there I doubt
you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you can see it but it's right in the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
you can see it but it's right in the
middle<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> camera<00:01:31.290> there

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
middle of the camera there

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.300 
middle of the camera there
there's<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:32.939> snares<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> run

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
there's our snares a little bit of a run

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
there's our snares a little bit of a run
that's<00:01:35.310> where<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.640> gonna<00:01:35.820> put<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> trap<00:01:36.560> but

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
that's where I'm gonna put the trap but

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
that's where I'm gonna put the trap but
this<00:01:37.890> video<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.700> show<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> and

explain to you what these big mounds are
that<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.479> yard<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that are in your yard and that you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260 
that are in your yard and that you
really<00:01:44.189> can't<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.549> anything<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:44.939> them

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
really can't do anything about them

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410 
really can't do anything about them
another<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:47.430> male<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:48.180> pop<00:01:48.390> up

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
another thing is is one male can pop up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
another thing is is one male can pop up
three<00:01:48.960> four<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> large<00:01:50.250> male<00:01:50.549> even

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
three four if it's a large male even

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.210 
three four if it's a large male even
more<00:01:51.210> breeding<00:01:51.600> chambers<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.979> probably

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
more breeding chambers and you probably

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.149 
more breeding chambers and you probably
have<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.509> yard<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
have more than one in your yard and
