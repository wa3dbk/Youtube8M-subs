00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how
you<00:00:02.669> can<00:00:02.790> record<00:00:02.939> your<00:00:03.270> gameplay<00:00:03.449> without

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
you can record your gameplay without

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.039 
you can record your gameplay without
using<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.740> capture<00:00:05.009> device<00:00:05.299> so<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.660> have<00:00:06.870> two

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
using a capture device so you have two

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.190 
using a capture device so you have two
options<00:00:07.080> or<00:00:08.240> two<00:00:09.240> applications<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.050> can

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
options or two applications you can

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.520 
options or two applications you can
choose<00:00:10.380> from<00:00:10.880> first<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.120> Benny<00:00:12.360> come<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
choose from first is Benny come and the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.930 
choose from first is Benny come and the
second<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.219> fraps

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
second one is fraps

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.960 
second one is fraps
I<00:00:15.089> don't<00:00:15.719> use<00:00:15.960> fraps<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.310> main<00:00:17.460> reason<00:00:17.820> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I don't use fraps the main reason is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
I don't use fraps the main reason is
because<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.720> doesn't<00:00:18.960> compress<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.710> videos

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
because it doesn't compress the videos

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.160 
because it doesn't compress the videos
it<00:00:20.250> produces<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.660> you'll<00:00:21.810> end<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.109> with

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it produces and so you'll end up with

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
it produces and so you'll end up with
really<00:00:22.590> large<00:00:22.980> files<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.359> can

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
really large files pretty much you can

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.050 
really large files pretty much you can
record<00:00:24.779> almost<00:00:25.590> 5<00:00:26.070> minutes<00:00:26.400> you'll<00:00:26.760> end<00:00:26.939> up

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
record almost 5 minutes you'll end up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.349 
record almost 5 minutes you'll end up
for<00:00:27.330> example<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.960> 8<00:00:28.529> gigabytes<00:00:29.070> file<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.090> yeah

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
for example an 8 gigabytes file so yeah

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.100 
for example an 8 gigabytes file so yeah
it's<00:00:31.199> not<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.679> choice<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.930> have

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's not the right choice but we have

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's not the right choice but we have
here<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> bandicam<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.520> another

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
here is bandicam which is another

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
here is bandicam which is another
recording<00:00:36.809> application<00:00:37.550> gaming<00:00:38.550> recording

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
recording application gaming recording

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.770 
recording application gaming recording
application<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:41.730> compresses<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.450> videos

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
application and it compresses the videos

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
application and it compresses the videos
and<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.500> has<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.160> mean<00:00:44.520> you'll<00:00:44.850> end<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and it has I mean you'll end up with a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
and it has I mean you'll end up with a
good<00:00:45.660> quality<00:00:45.899> video<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.680> well<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.610> low<00:00:48.030> size

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
good quality video as well as a low size
video<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.590> I'd<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.820> bandicam

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
video so I'd go with the bandicam

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.970 
video so I'd go with the bandicam
but<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.530> both<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.829> not
