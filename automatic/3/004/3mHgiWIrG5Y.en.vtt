00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and he became really quite Placid and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.490 
and he became really quite Placid and
terribly<00:02:11.069> well

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
terribly well

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640

which was at out and you could see with

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.110 
which was at out and you could see with
his<00:02:15.739> eyes<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> lot<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.970> eyes

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
his eyes there was a lot of the eyes

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.240 
his eyes there was a lot of the eyes
were<00:02:17.330> moving<00:02:17.660> around<00:02:17.870> quite<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.290> lot<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:19.130> it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
were moving around quite a lot but it

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
to be much easier to tell us but it's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.070
