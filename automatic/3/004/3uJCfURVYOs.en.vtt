white does decide to take it and again

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.310 
white does decide to take it and again
you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.480> focusing<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.750> fork<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you know focusing on the the fork of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
you know focusing on the the fork of the
the<00:01:08.220> rook<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.299> Queen

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the rook and the Queen

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.000 
the rook and the Queen
so<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> Queen<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> move<00:01:10.799> out

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
so the Queen is going to move out

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
so the Queen is going to move out
attacking<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.950> night<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.930> night

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
attacking this this night and the night

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
attacking this this night and the night
is<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.250> he<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is going to see here that he has the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
is going to see here that he has the
fork<00:01:18.830> protected<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.430> bishop<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.000> he<00:01:21.150> takes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
fork protected by the bishop so he takes

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
fork protected by the bishop so he takes
the<00:01:21.600> fork<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:24.290> Queen<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> again

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the fork and the Queen is going to again

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
the fork and the Queen is going to again
is<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> come<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is going to come up and is going to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.480 
is going to come up and is going to
attack<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.070> rook<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.009> rook<00:01:32.220> moves

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
attack the rook so now the rook moves

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
attack the rook so now the rook moves
over<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.799> black<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
over and we're going to get black is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.219 
over and we're going to get black is
going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> give<00:01:35.820> White's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
going to give White's a little bit of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.390 
going to give White's a little bit of
breathing<00:01:37.439> room<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.700> he<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> take<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
breathing room so that he can take that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
breathing room so that he can take that
that's<00:01:41.400> rook<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.780> he<00:01:42.840> goes<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> he<00:01:43.259> takes<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that's rook see he goes and he takes the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's rook see he goes and he takes the
rook<00:01:43.850> which<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.720> second<00:01:46.110> part<00:01:46.290> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
rook which really was the second part of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.490 
rook which really was the second part of
the<00:01:46.439> trap<00:01:46.850> because<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.020> bishop<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the trap because now the bishop is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
the trap because now the bishop is
attacking<00:01:49.860> whites<00:01:50.579> Queen

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
attacking whites Queen

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060 
attacking whites Queen
so<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.140> White<00:01:52.470> has<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.710> couple<00:01:53.009> different

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so now White has a couple different

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.100 
so now White has a couple different
options<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> look<00:01:54.960> at

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
options but and we're going to look at

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
options but and we're going to look at
them<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:55.860> let's<00:01:56.070> say<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> he

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
them here so now let's say that he

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.109 
them here so now let's say that he
blocks<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.630> his<00:01:57.890> Knight<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.790> he<00:01:59.909> blocks

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
blocks with his Knight so if he blocks

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
blocks with his Knight so if he blocks
with<00:02:00.299> his<00:02:00.329> Knight<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.259> come<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.649> we

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
with his Knight then we come in and we

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.429 
with his Knight then we come in and we
have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.009> smothered<00:02:02.460> mate<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.840> saw<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.170> mother

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
have a smothered mate we saw this mother

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.510 
have a smothered mate we saw this mother
made<00:02:04.740> recently<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.850> Mortimer<00:02:06.149> trap<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
made recently with the Mortimer trap so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.889 
made recently with the Mortimer trap so
now<00:02:08.640> let's<00:02:08.879> say<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.149> he<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
now let's say that he doesn't do that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.950 
now let's say that he doesn't do that
let's<00:02:10.259> say<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.560> instead<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.039> coming<00:02:11.670> there

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
let's say that instead of coming there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.760 
let's say that instead of coming there
he<00:02:12.080> moves<00:02:12.620> his<00:02:13.040> pawn<00:02:13.430> forward<00:02:14.080> okay<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.650> he

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
he moves his pawn forward okay so he

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.440 
he moves his pawn forward okay so he
moves<00:02:15.950> his<00:02:16.070> pawn<00:02:16.340> forward<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.120> take<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
moves his pawn forward you just take the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.320 
moves his pawn forward you just take the
