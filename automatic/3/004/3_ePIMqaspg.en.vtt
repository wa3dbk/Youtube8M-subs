00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.959
 Hello there 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.779
 Today, I am going to make such a delicious thing so delicious, so decadent. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.440
 You can't just be a piece. This is to do a correct today IM 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.139
 Cheesecake with chocolate swirls 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.409
 For this recipe you will need the following materials. Butter thickening cream, 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.820
 Cream cheese, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 Fine granulated sugar, some chocolate, some chocolate biscuits 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.200
 And some cheese 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 Put the chocolate biscuit into a food processor and start by making the base 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.240
 Now if you don't have a food processor 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.430
 Just put the cookies into a zipper lock bag, with a rolling pin and bash 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.840
 Once the crushed biscuits are in our butter 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.060
 Lightly grease next to it 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.630
 Spring form pot. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 Now put the cookie into the pot and mix it 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 Even all this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 Use a cup next to the base and push down compactly 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.540
 Next the microwave oven is once every 15 seconds, stirring each time until the melted, melted chocolate. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.800
 Now enter the mixing bowl where 250 grams of whey 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.690
 Then 250 grams of cream cheese 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.080
 Then two-thirds of a cup of sugar 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 Then mix until they are well combined. Once combined with additional thickening cream 250g 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 Then hit for five minutes 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 Until the mixture is smooth and thick 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.939
 This is your future consistency, it is good thick and cream 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:16.469
 Now to the base, then even if it comes out of the mixture 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.299
 Down the chocolate at room temperature 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.879
 Simple vortex around the outside, then move to the center 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.150
 As long as you get a good model 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:45.079
 Now use a knife around the vortex until you get a nice ripple effect and pass the whole cheesecake 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.939
 Now, once completed 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.949
 Put the cheesecake in the frozen for two hours, then this will be ready to serve 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.029
 If you want it to freeze they leave it overnight. 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.469
 I just took it out of the fridge for two hours and it looks great. 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.129
 Just put it and the service on the plate now. 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.409
