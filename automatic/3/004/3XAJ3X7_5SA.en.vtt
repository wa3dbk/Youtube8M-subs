00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.140
 I'm going to show you what this device is 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:09.140
 I miss that he is here on the ground 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.420
 these are some towers to grow in 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.390
 systems or conical some people 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.910
 they use them in hydroponic systems 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.100
 I have some videos where he taught 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.760
 do this because you are going to use 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.000
 a heat gun 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.530
 and a heat gun let's say it that way 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.290
 similar to a hair dryer but it is 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.300
 more powerful being sighted helps us 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.340
 do this but please recommend them 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.220
 that they see that video in this case I 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 I will explain some 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 some characteristics of this system 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.470
 The first thing is that we are using a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 quarter square foot for each tube 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.780
 because then it's just 4x4 it's 1/4 of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 diameter would be because you know 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.440
 the other thing is that we're going to these are going to 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.360
 lift and obviously week and install 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.610
 vertically and then I'm not going to 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.960
 show where I'm going to put it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.960
 so they do not get confused 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.490
 I'm just putting it here in the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.580
 because you can put more than 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.860
 one of these to see I'm going to approach a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.490
 little for cameras that comes how is that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 water works water reached by a 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.710
 side begins to fall to go down to 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.369
 go down and then as you did with the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.640
 heat was made was given pressure 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.550
 then it became a concave part and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.530
 good and another convection or so and so 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 the water starts to travel and get to 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.369
 the other side always moistening the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.130
 means that you have to grow 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.690
 now the means I suddenly refer to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.730
 volcanic rock 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.950
 the river stone that I do not have much 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.660
 Well, I recommend you not have much 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.060
 edge because they can be damaged in the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.550
 fingers and cutting yourself with a salt thing 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.030
 sometimes they are sharper they can not 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.400
 use other things for example 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 Coconut fiber is also good for this 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.460
 so then look for a material that does not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.880
 especially in this that does not go 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.250
 to obstruct the ways so that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.780
 that the water has its flows then 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.430
 that what happens with this now is the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.340
 vertical part in this case with three 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 I have several more towers that I'm going to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.030
 organize but you can do this 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 how do I want to do the configuration 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.780
 as you like in the middle I am 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.530
 leaving space obviously so that 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.130
 grow in this case it's going to be strawberries 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.930
 but you can plant lettuce 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.190
 spinach what you want then 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.190
 these are these things are very 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.659
 because for me they are spectacular because 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.280
 you can can plant too many 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.349
 things just look for a plant that 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.540
 go to hold up of seeded and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.480
 tomato in this and it's awesome it 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.890
 grows in the best possible way but of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.959
 all ways in the bottom part I have 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.640
 some baskets these baskets are three 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.730
 inches I just did the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.790
 Transformations with a drill of 3 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.099
 inches much much much care I just 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.049
 to cut magnificent with with this pod 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.310
 because in the small pieces the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.930
 drill bits tend to grip the entire tube and 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.640
 and turn the tube then well there 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.280
 I got in a little and had the gloves soldier 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.739
 but I ask you to have a lot 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.659
 careful when you use these are the 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.560
 faces these faces are the 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.760
 they can order and well there are many 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.810
 places but I just want them 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.209
 show if I translate it the name would be 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.740
 would be mesh glasses and if I say it in 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.100
 English would be net 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.110
 caps 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.780
 then they look for them in that way 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.170
 caps or mesh cups and this is for 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.240
 hydroponics or made up or good all 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.350
 these notes could then you 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.450
 I recommend then that what is going to 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.790
 spend the water simply going to have a 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.400
 flow 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.040
 with a small tilt and this other 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.599
 time is to return to their tanks or where 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.180
 you have your fish or where they have 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.439
 some filtration system too 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.920
 I have a filtration system in the 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:13.989
 videos that are called triple filter can 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.250
 look at it and that's interesting suddenly 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.660
 they like the idea they can only do 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.009
 one but then it is practical then 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.560
 I appreciate you have seen this video 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.180
 I recommend that you subscribe for 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.660
 please comment and I would like 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.680
 answer them in the best possible way and 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.610
 have a nice day 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.610
 thank you very much
