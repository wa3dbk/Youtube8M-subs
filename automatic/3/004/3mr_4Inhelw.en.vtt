00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.200 

but<00:02:07.119> criticism<00:02:08.119> does<00:02:08.360> work<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.420> that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
but criticism does work and so that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.850 
but criticism does work and so that
works<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:18.050> what<00:02:18.080> else<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.470> comes<00:02:18.650> included

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
works see what else it comes included

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860 
works see what else it comes included
with<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.400> strong<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.180> comes<00:02:20.420> included<00:02:20.660> with

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
with the strong it comes included with

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.270 
with the strong it comes included with
barnacle<00:02:21.550> which<00:02:22.550> allows<00:02:22.820> for<00:02:22.850> Wi-Fi<00:02:23.450> feeding

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
barnacle which allows for Wi-Fi feeding

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.830 
barnacle which allows for Wi-Fi feeding
you<00:02:25.280> have<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> settings<00:02:26.240> though<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you have to go to settings though and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.540 
you have to go to settings though and
put<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.830> checkmark<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.520> skip<00:02:28.970> WPA<00:02:29.660> supplicant

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
put a checkmark on skip WPA supplicant

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.730 
put a checkmark on skip WPA supplicant
so<00:02:31.550> then<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.990> only<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.440> once

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
so then you can you only do that once

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.430 
so then you can you only do that once
and<00:02:33.950> after<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.480> you'll<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:36.080> long<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.350> you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
and after that you'll as long as you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.949 
and after that you'll as long as you
allow<00:02:36.590> super<00:02:37.010> user<00:02:37.300> Wi-Fi<00:02:38.300> feeding<00:02:38.660> will<00:02:38.780> work
