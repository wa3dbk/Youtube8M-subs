that's really kind of what we strive to
do<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.300> being<00:00:33.540> said<00:00:34.040> there's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
do but that being said there's a lot of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.459 
do but that being said there's a lot of
rules<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> build<00:00:36.930> traditional<00:00:37.320> car

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
rules like if you build traditional car

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.750 
rules like if you build traditional car
they're<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> done<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> same<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.520> every

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
they're kind of done the same way every

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
they're kind of done the same way every
time<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.149> we've<00:00:39.300> tried<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.899> bend<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> rules

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
time so we've tried to bend the rules

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.250 
time so we've tried to bend the rules
and<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.910> least<00:00:42.239> still<00:00:42.540> add<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.930> creative

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and at least still add some creative

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
and at least still add some creative
design<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> bills<00:00:44.329> okay<00:00:45.329> wait<00:00:45.570> why<00:00:45.780> don't

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
design to the bills okay wait why don't

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
design to the bills okay wait why don't
you<00:00:45.960> tell<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.320> bit<00:00:46.469> about<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.920> car

we're<00:01:26.930> we're<00:01:27.930> probably<00:01:28.259> about<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.740> year<00:01:28.890> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
we're we're probably about a year in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
we're we're probably about a year in
full<00:01:30.030> time<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.409> project<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
full time on this project right now and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
full time on this project right now and
it's<00:01:32.490> still<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.150> complete<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it's still not complete this is just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's still not complete this is just
bare<00:01:34.740> metal<00:01:35.130> mock-up<00:01:35.610> stage<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.090> still<00:01:36.360> needs

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bare metal mock-up stage it still needs

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.310 
bare metal mock-up stage it still needs
you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.470> paint<00:01:37.979> polish<00:01:38.930> chroming<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you know paint polish chroming the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
you know paint polish chroming the
reassembly<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> finish<00:01:42.000> work<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.630> maybe

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
reassembly and the finish work so maybe

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.120 
reassembly and the finish work so maybe
next<00:01:43.079> year<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.560> we'll<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.710> able<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> see

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
next year you think we'll be able to see

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
next year you think we'll be able to see
the<00:01:44.250> finished<00:01:44.399> product<00:01:44.880> absolutely<00:01:45.450> that's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the finished product absolutely that's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
the finished product absolutely that's
the<00:01:45.780> idea<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.740> plan<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.070> showing<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.520> car

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the idea as we plan on showing this car

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
the idea as we plan on showing this car
finished<00:01:48.240> next<00:01:48.899> year<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.770> coupe
