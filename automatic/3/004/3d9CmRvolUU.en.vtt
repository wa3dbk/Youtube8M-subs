00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Welcome to the next episode 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.779
 the fifa 15 ultimate kroto glory with 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.700
 wayne rooney and totally stupid and me 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.900
 hope you all will like like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.710
 Let 's thumb up that we 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.080
 really nice 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.020
 and yes last time we whole 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 earned five points so points 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.300
 57 half text or 215 capex and one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 seven and a half perfect and we do that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 We start with the seven and a half 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 car pack and maybe watch 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.070
 something good doing something we did 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.860
 maybe use properly around 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.960
 to improve our team astoria 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.960
 he is not too bad now 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.790
 nothing in the seven half capex 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.160
 15k jumbo pack let's see what we got there 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 get 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.090
 do after this summit one more thing on 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.070
 now with a bit of luck 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 sami khedira ok july 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 meadow was ok I'm not so much yet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.400
 khedira ok overall, not a good one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.460
 pack not happy pack lay ok 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.260
 last spec and then let's see if 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 we can improve something there we can 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.580
 maybe one the right midfield 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.490
 or something is fig and we get 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.369
 tobert lindegaard or caballero 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 and we do not get lamela bad 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.320
 and danilo around also not wrong under 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 I can see if I can still do that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.909
 a little better 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.079
 and yes let's see if I 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.060
 now everything here in the club 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.070
 pack and we'll see if he's something nice 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 I can conjure it up 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 first set up a bit 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.900
 so left by the formation 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.280
 but was a bit changed what we did 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.259
 you still only had players yourself 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 we had that we packed it we 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.290
 from peer they have now on the left 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.649
 This is not actually a page 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.119
 bad 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.820
 We have sterling here I can 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 Of course, so let's do the thing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 now here on the position 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.860
 I caught up with lamela and danilo and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.980
 I have 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.780
 but what's the name of it? 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.260
 better chemistry then you get here 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.310
 on 7 only just one only is still 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.620
 not really good 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.210
 Of course we would have alternatives as well 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.810
 not so good alternative for 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.310
 left midfield 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.480
 there are still some missing us 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.400
 bit me but also looked left 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 We do not have wings like that either 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.610
 long do nothing if we all times 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.170
 look at 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.490
 We would still have the animals here 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.570
 we can wrap up some others there 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.890
 marchetti so the good ones 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.410
 for the left side we do not have 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.870
 left defender and so on kampe 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.959
 and did not hate we have seen okay 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220
 Well let's try it first 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.030
 to make a play what to see like it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.430
 then it runs until we match in the same 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 have an opponent very nice that went 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.150
 relatively fast and look like 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.580
 who plays here he has with three 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.330
 defensive that may be bad 45 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.920
 emi which is very beneficial to us he is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.260
 but there are a few fast and strong 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.940
 player at auxerre champion i see 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.620
 There where a vegetarian silva that 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.330
 The next good fits in is close in the zdf 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.400
 nice to the front 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:26.540
 manu or is currently pulling the place it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.170
 comes the flank head then yes it 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.170
 gives the corner 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.370
 strong shows are awesome 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.980
 that was just ok ok to zero 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.820
 please what i have not done anything i have 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.220
 played the ball 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.590
 I wanted to say I wanted to 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.920
 say how can that be I have only the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.920
 played ball 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 dollar 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.530
 clean i thought the thing was good again 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.850
 out of the gate 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.430
 wonderfully presented the ball 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.020
 styling is running live is running and running 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.330
 then pulls off and the keeper can only 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.570
 look back and that is too 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.570
 in it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.850
 wonderful I thought it more often again 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.850
 out that would have been it and there 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.180
 the skin does not clean the thing 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:46.460
 annoying concentration led 10 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.540
 that's not bad though 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.670
 that was just a bad thing 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.370
 get it started first half time 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.660
 53 shots looks alright 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.920
 two shots from the goal 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.880
 but our opponent actually plays 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.730
 not wrong has a bit of that 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.900
 feel that he is slightly stronger there 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.210
 plays as our opponent before that 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.570
 maybe even ticking stronger than us 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.570
 even 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:22.419
 stirling stirling and fantasy lousy 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.220
 made but placed over somehow 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.050
 I just had to do it now 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.669
 So the thing just now here 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.750
 sure is van persie running is there 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.830
 actually had the really good 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.360
 defender or maybe the one 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.949
 Keeper before that things have 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.379
 have to 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:39.960
 the jump because hours to three F-type 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:41.979
 It's just a bit mean today, though 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.569
 We have to do that for sure 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.750
 we have to go first 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.750
 win 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:56.139
 Gosh 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.879
 I am with sterling with by the 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.300
 but helped the referee the barn 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.190
 right inside in sterling no the for 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.190
 you whistled 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.190
 OK 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.550
 huhu rappelkiste 69 minutes 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.550
 corner for our opponent 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.840
 do we have 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.860
 pow 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:52.599
 and the 88 again 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.259
 oh man and the opponent drake it will be 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:59.319
 two points for rooney time for the 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.169
 Two other goals a puzzle the victory 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.400
 and progress means six points 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:08.400
 here for us that also means 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.710
 at the same time victory for the championship 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.370
 our keeper today 10.0 perfect everything 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.430
 held 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.430
 clean performance means very well then 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.599
 for the exit and for or for 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.620
 the championship directly again 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.750
 additional pack 1 1 715 car pack in 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.370
 principle so eight points here next 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:31.780
 then follow 415 capex to upgrade 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.889
 our team i hope you now 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.199
 like to let your thumb go 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.580
 above as you look at the title 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.409
 won now rise in the 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.050
 next league and there we look like it 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:43.030
 I hope you are back 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.330
 Next time with it makes it good until 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.330
 then
