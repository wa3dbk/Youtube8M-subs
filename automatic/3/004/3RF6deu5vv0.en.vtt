00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.290
 today's life we find ourselves for 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.500
 a poko phoning video or for that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 new team at bone x and the 23rd of good 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 little players at the scale in the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.769
 packs so down especially lionel messi who 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
 still has a shape 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.930
 we also have a little a little muller 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.740
 succeeded muller that can be quite good 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.680
 general and the mario good that too 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 then at stake in a game that may not be 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 badly also france to smalling which is a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.469
 track I do not know 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.059
 lyon is certainly not the money 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.219
 so I did not see much in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.140
 may not be vacant and so again 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 so that's kind of level ago when 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 even very heavy I hope to have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.879

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.310

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.110
 rare means average duration of many 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.780
 risks and nice stats but hey 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.340

 the good trolls we had paid nine 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.720

 we're going here and we're going to control his price 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.970
 that this must be at all agree 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.350
 I thought she had tasted a 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.350
 little bit more expensive anyway 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.050

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.170

 what good ok besides one at all but yeah 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.130
 I was expecting it to cost in 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.210
 credit limits of unicredit is a good 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.760
 price for the barbots and a lack 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.620
 of equity we open the last pack the 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.130

 skip krakowiak ok for me it's not the 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.440
 case in the latter not how is this 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.050
 that by wanting we give just right 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.820
 all she's going to not a credit so 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.200
 we will not have had any 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.050
 cut in this pack opening but good on 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.340

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.690
 phenomenal to each pack to the public 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.520

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.570
 they barbeau up sees pretty much everything 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.220
 than anything I typed in this pack 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.200
 winning it's true that out of 300 am 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.280

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.690
 been reimbursed the very very far from there 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.670
 it is sure but improving the chance to 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.780
