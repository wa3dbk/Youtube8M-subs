00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.820
 and look at the robot and elton here to give 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.000
 a somewhat disturbing news 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 but let's calm calmly here is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 crowd following the Japanese government is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.369
 planning to end piracy of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.470
 manga and anime on the internet reminds me a lot 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.010
 What happened to that soup project? 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 but leave it here a little of matter 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.989
 for you 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 the link is in the exhibition if you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.570
 want after the full story but 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 I'll have here a little mrp manga and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 chubby anime project design 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 headed by the ministry of the economy 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 trade and industry in japan aimed at 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 monitor consumption and sharing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.390
 this form of unauthorized material 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 order to remove on one in a first 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.049
 shall be audited from 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.830
 August during the next five months 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.780
 Chinese website that said oak that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.689
 illegally available 580 works 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.850
 500 manga titles and 80 anime titles 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.119
 a list that includes heavy weights as 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
 dragon ball the apex pokémon and the rational 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.979
 I mourn them the day with others 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.829
 the initiative even put on the air a website 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.799
 with a listing showing legal means 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.880
 for cichero read part of these works 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.670
 finally you can check there the link that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 will be in the first description link there 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.890
 is very reminiscent of the project 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.590
 soup that happened not remember when 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.390
 A little while ago I do not know 12 years 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.179
 maybe three years of bossa so 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 and by that time they managed to get 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.200
 multiple sites air sites give download 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.329
 in general many youtube videos too 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.069
 many google images have been erased 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 and more and try to talk if you did not think 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.490
 more pictures on google and got 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.920
 bring down the business here 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.259
 for a new cloth and fuck if the deal 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.630
 came back all did not have an inspection 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.619
 and everything went back to being like 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 it was night 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.440
 some even came back better then 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.680
 that they can knock down multiple sites 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.730
 Download 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.599
 an end to illegality is unlawful 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.140
 It does not provide illegal ways you are 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.180
 chicane cap levanda online or download 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.139
 these things even if they do 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.230
 to overthrow maybe it is very likely that 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:41.079
 this does not continue as soon as the sites that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.510
 happen the same thing, come back, right? 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.689
 maybe even stronger by taking it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.040
 more precautions maybe 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.659
 I saw the list and it looks like I did not 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
 There was a mistake and this is not a mistake. 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.409
 I saw an anita bé was there in the middle 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 also say the popular and so right 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.569
 beautiful pretty where she is maybe 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.709
 in the anime that also falls at last let's see 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.329
 What are you going to give us because we're just going to 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.969
 know even 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.159
 in practice if anything is going to happen 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.139
 It's really going to affect here. 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.719
 In Brazil, linking the problem is that here 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.629
 Brazil does not have a supply of 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:23.019
 anime and manga say official aa 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.900
 pane is the end the help the publishing staff 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.139
 even machga manga streaming even 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.659
 Anime, we have a little corner, like this. 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.400
 who talks about gum but he arrived there 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.019
 Before long I think came this year 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.599
 I'm not mistaken and very weak. 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.430
 still at least I did not even know and today 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.650
 I do not even know how it works 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.449
 people in the united states already know 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.129
 well, people usually watch over there 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.989
 animals, then I do not even know how 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.049
 It works, you have to pay how much 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.819
 you look out how does the legend 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.720
 it's not that quality I do not know anything 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.459
 Valuable so wait to see what 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.430
 will not give 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.319

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.199
