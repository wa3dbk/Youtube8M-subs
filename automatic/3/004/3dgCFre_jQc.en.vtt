00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
think these are the PCI Express disabled

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.720 
think these are the PCI Express disabled
jumpers<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.530> also<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.040> these<00:00:11.309> jumpers

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
jumpers they do also have these jumpers

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.680 
jumpers they do also have these jumpers
on<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.889> ECP<00:00:13.889> v2<00:00:14.429> i'll<00:00:14.880> show<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.330> on

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
on the ECP v2 i'll show you that on

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.970 
on the ECP v2 i'll show you that on
there<00:00:16.320> somewhere<00:00:16.710> we've<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> PCI

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
there somewhere we've got the PCI

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.490 
there somewhere we've got the PCI
disabled<00:00:19.980> jumpers<00:00:20.779> which<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.170> literally

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
disabled jumpers which you can literally

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
disabled jumpers which you can literally
just<00:00:22.740> unplug<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:23.820> off<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> off<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.539> jumpers

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
just unplug them off the off the jumpers

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
just unplug them off the off the jumpers
there<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:25.380> disable<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> PCI<00:00:26.820> slots

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there and it will disable the PCI slots

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.759 
there and it will disable the PCI slots

these are for increased voltages and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220 
these are for increased voltages and
you'll<00:00:52.590> notice<00:00:52.770> two<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.809> vcore

you'll notice two of them are for vcore
each<00:00:55.980> press<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.579> those<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:57.090> increase<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
each press on those will increase the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
each press on those will increase the

vcore x naught point 1 volt and the last

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
vcore x naught point 1 volt and the last
one<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> VTT<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> usually<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
one is the VTT which is the usually the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.100 
one is the VTT which is the usually the
uncool<00:01:04.619> voltage<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> cpu<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.990> can

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
uncool voltage for the cpu you can

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
uncool voltage for the cpu you can
increase<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:07.619> nor<00:01:08.189> point<00:01:08.430> 1<00:01:08.549> volts<00:01:08.850> as

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
increase that by nor point 1 volts as

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
increase that by nor point 1 volts as
well<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:09.960> pretty<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.500> handy<00:01:10.799> just

you so that's a nice inclusion as well I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.140 
you so that's a nice inclusion as well I
believe<00:02:32.200> that's<00:02:32.620> about<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.880> say<00:02:34.060> about

believe that's about all to say about

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
believe that's about all to say about
the<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.960> front<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.350> board<00:02:35.530> back<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.910 
the the front of the board back of the
board<00:02:36.940> now<00:02:37.420> you'll<00:02:37.690> notice<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.200> retention

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
board now you'll notice the retention

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.030 
board now you'll notice the retention
bracket<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:40.000> black<00:02:41.010> which<00:02:42.010> is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
bracket there it's black which is

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.340 
bracket there it's black which is
different<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:43.000> again<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.780> some<00:02:44.260> other

motherboards and the attaching or the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.550 
motherboards and the attaching or the
point<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:48.820> use<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.450> hold<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.140> heat<00:02:50.260> sinks

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
point we use here to hold the heat sinks

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.740 
point we use here to hold the heat sinks
down<00:02:50.760> our<00:02:51.760> screws<00:02:52.270> with<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.709> bit<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.950> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
down our screws with a little bit of a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.380 
down our screws with a little bit of a
gap<00:02:55.750> spacer<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:58.060> that's<00:02:58.209> obviously

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
gap spacer there so that's obviously

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.020 
gap spacer there so that's obviously
well<00:02:58.810> well<00:02:59.140> attached<00:02:59.500> onto<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.880> motherboard

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
well well attached onto the motherboard

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.550 
well well attached onto the motherboard
these<00:03:01.480> aren't<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:01.900> anywhere<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.440> they're

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
these aren't going anywhere and they're

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.250 
these aren't going anywhere and they're
going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.740> probably<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.610> some<00:03:03.880> pretty<00:03:04.090> good

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
going to probably have some pretty good

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.570 
going to probably have some pretty good
connection<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.560> what<00:03:06.190> they're<00:03:06.340> calling

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
connection with the what they're calling

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.430 
connection with the what they're calling
underneath<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.330> you've<00:03:07.540> got<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> NF<00:03:07.990> 200

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
underneath it you've got the NF 200

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.380 
underneath it you've got the NF 200
underneath<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:08.950> one<00:03:09.190> got<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.850> PCH

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
underneath this one got the PCH

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.000 
underneath this one got the PCH
underneath<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.990> one<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> power

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
underneath that one and the power

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.160 
underneath that one and the power
delivery<00:03:12.400> underneath<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.000> one<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.930> sir

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
delivery underneath that one it's sir

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.990 
delivery underneath that one it's sir
this<00:03:14.500> has<00:03:14.620> also<00:03:14.770> got<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> power<00:03:15.400> connection<00:03:15.820> so

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
this has also got a power connection so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.720 
this has also got a power connection so
on<00:03:16.180> I'm<00:03:16.420> hoping<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.739> assuming<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.459> lights

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
on I'm hoping and assuming this lights

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.250 
on I'm hoping and assuming this lights
up<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.180> will<00:03:19.300> probably<00:03:19.570> provide<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.110> nice

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
up and will probably provide a nice

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.000 
up and will probably provide a nice
pulsating<00:03:21.070> glow<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.530> make<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.650> board<00:03:23.800> look
