00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:43.300
 Waste of water but otherwise me

 In general, I read everyone inside 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.729
 Eve 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 I am super shy when I am new 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.899
 get to know people 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.659

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.709

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.709
 really uncomfortable i hate sport 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.269
 it's just me that way 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.489
 school sports I hate think that the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 most unnecessary in this world and john 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.380
 gordon is just such a 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.360
 Kassel is I've been more often 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.040
 trying to do sports regularly so 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.019
 I have any plans created 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.079
 and so on but it just works 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.970
 not i can not get it i have 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.360
 do not know where the week or something 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.599
 maybe persevered and then sat 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.329
 I sat on my bed and turned off 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.310
 does not sound like i hate thunderstorms and 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.500
 I also was a bit scared 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 So I know I 'm not scared now 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.569
 that somehow I have a hard time but 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.310
 no idea I just have this 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.910
 noise is whether you really goose bumps 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.220
 I'm afraid of spiders 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.390
 So I'm really scared that nothing happens to me 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.010
 but do a lot and if only 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.190
 solo mini spindler this was always is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 I just do not have to go away I love 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.950
 fruit and every fruit but I eat a lot 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.500
 much too little of it 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.750
 katie melua yes it is so far the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.050
 best series for me i have in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.820
 primary school collected these sheets and 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.250
 I have always said this but it 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.990
 This is called I know I always have 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.260
 exchanged my friends and would have 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.650
 whole album made 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.340
 I had already noticed only pets 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.080
 I had fish or turtles 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.240
 My family had but they are 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.540
 then my fischer I still had 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.140
 two rabbits in total now in cats 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.140
 but only 2 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:06.400
 All in all, I had three monsters and that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.860
 was it I think it's super uncomfortable because 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.950
 I have birthday and just people 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.200
 for me it's really cute and sweet 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.680
 but I know who they are 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.600
 Otherwise, I should thank the aha 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.910
 is a bit uncomfortable i think 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.480
 my mother wanted me first katharina 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.000
 become 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.360
 but then my aunt has a child 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.430
 got and has long taken away 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.410
 but I am satisfied I have worked 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.210
 am not a phone so look for him 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.520
 normal adolescents are in my age 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.770
 yes somehow permanent berlin but me 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.920
 not really so I go 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.300
 just be another day but otherwise I am 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.690
 I actually migrants there 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 I really want to play the piano and march 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.089
 but I am far too little 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.300
 to learn the great foul new songs 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:03.429
 I'm doing my abi in many years and 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.080
 I'm really scared of it now 

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.969
 So I know if I already like that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.009
 Do not be afraid and do not like four 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:14.080
 Years will be because then I just 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:17.379
 heart of war i have no 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.119
 only pair of high heels so 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.419
 shit bin is 15 that's too 

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.189
 somehow I find normal but if you 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.289
 so the adolescents at my age 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.389
 comparison then it is something and 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.249
 normal for you 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.879
 I 'm a bit forgetful more often 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:35.369
 and here also really like what's there 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.699
 a few little stories from 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:42.429
 lost sports bag many bags and 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.459
 so on I usually forget that 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:47.919
 things then you have my favorite picture Film 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:50.589
 I can not find it, I just think that 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.579
 story so cute and the fish 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:56.739
 and me the film but in general 

00:05:54.579 --> 00:06:00.429
 dear other disney movie i mean if 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:02.139
 I 'm more scared people too 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:03.530
 so lose in the sense of if you 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.300
 die because 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.290
 I then no one supposed to live on 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.320
 So if that's me then 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.750
 imagine or are their general 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.220
 would die pets follow I know 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.530
 then just do not want to live on 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.140
 because they got really good 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.300
 all and no idea i think so 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.300
 It would be my life long 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.730
 I have a hard time for depression 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.440
 Tension not really in the long run 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.840
 Maybe the world is not exactly the month 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.880
 but also i have to pay a sign 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.580
 but I will not show you this now because 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.200
 he really looks like shit 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.780
 I really had everyone for a while 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.950
 day headache 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.900
 for about half a year or so 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.150
 then it was gone for a while then 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.640
 not again and it with his story 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.440
 but if you want 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.970
 Can I make my video so the 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.450
 reasons and so we went away 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.460
 There are a few small tricks left 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.260
 whenever a friend is with me 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.540
 stay or I am with her then 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.770
 I 'm always the first one to fall asleep 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.590
 or tired 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.270
 I have little to no 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.670

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.860
 so i had one i had one 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.450

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.180
 which men are never the lily 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.470
 Actually , it's faster and better 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.330
 I am very thankful 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.010
