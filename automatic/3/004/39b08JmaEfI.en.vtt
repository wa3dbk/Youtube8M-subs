00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 theological question to the belief 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.390
 traditional the traditional belief 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 mark that the four beasts that go up 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.580
 de danielle seven represent empires 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.969
 world as Babylon medo persia 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.609
 greece and rome the first one was like lion and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.160
 I had eagle wings I was looking 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 until their wings were ripped off and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 was lifted off the ground and put on and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.029
 it is on the feet as a man and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.279
 he was given the heart of a man and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 represents according to the traditional belief 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 to the first Babylonian empire and behold 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 another second beast like a bear 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 which was rising from one side more than 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.969
 of the other and had in his mouth three 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.270
 ribs between his teeth and he was 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.360
 said well get up devour a lot of meat 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.309
 and according to the traditional belief 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 represents the second empire that of the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 Persian medos 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.879
 after this look and here is another 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.309
 similar to a leopard with four wings 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.430
 of bird on their backs had also 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.400
 this beast four heads and he was given 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 domain and represents according to belief 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 traditional alter 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.120
 the kingdom greece after this looked 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 I in the visions of the night and here the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.100
 fourth frightening and terrible beast and in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.650
 great strong way which had some 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 big iron teeth devoured and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 it crumbled and the leftovers dreamed of its 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 feet and it was very different from all the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 beasts that I saw before her and had 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.120
 ten horns and represents the fourth 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.580
 Roman kingdom according to traditional belief 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.770
 this traditional position or theory has 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.010
 a big but big problem 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 danielle 717 says these four great 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.540
 beasts are four kings who 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.700
 will rise on earth remember that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.890
 the bible identifies both the kings 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 individual and beasts with empires 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.700
 worldwide as it can be if Daniel 717 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 is telling us that these four 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.020
 kingdoms are still about to rise as 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.320
 it can be the Babylonian lion and the bear 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 medo persia if the Babylonian empire already 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.429
 had fallen in time when daniel 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.070
 I received this prophecy and the Persian Med 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.620
 I was reigning back then and 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.659
 danielle 717 says that still 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 the empires are about to rise and 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.099
 I repeat again how can it be 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 Babylon the lion and medo persia the bear 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.739
 if the same bible is telling us that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 those kingdoms are about to rise 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.819
 Babylonian empire had already finished 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.040
 and the middle Persia empire was already 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.110
 raised in the time of danielle then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.260
 that was the empire that he was when 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.599
 he received these prophecies and if there is a 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.690
 error in this to what empires are concerned 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.430
 these beasts good here ends my 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 theological question to the belief 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.379
 traditional after making us this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.940
 questioning let's try a possible 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:56.370
 answer in matteo 24 15 says that so 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.379
 so much when you see in the holy place the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.260
 abomination of desolation that spoke the 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.780
 prophet daniel the one who reads understand flee 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.150
 to the mountains jesus identifies him as the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.159
 antichrist to the abomination of desolation and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.549
 Jesus is supported by this passage of 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.430
 danielle 89 and 13 in this little horn 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.290
 that grows and today a saint who spoke and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.690
 another of the saints said to him who 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 I was talking about how long the vision will last 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.560
 of the continuous sacrifice 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.360
 and the devastating prevarication that puts the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.190
 sanctuary and the army to be 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.620
 found and he told me up to 2300 days of 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.069
 late and tomorrow and the sanctuary will be 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.200
 purified then we conclude that this 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.750
 goat of danielle 8 is the empire 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.220
 of the antichrist in Daniel 88 says that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.530
 after this goat 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.110
 destroy the ram that we already saw who 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.120
 it was previously that big horn was 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
 they broke and in their place other 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.519
 four remarkable horns towards the four 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.350
 winds of heaven let's look at this 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.660
 expression and let's look at the expression in 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.090
 Daniel 7 about the four beasts that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
 they left the sea and behold the four 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.480
 winds of heaven were fighting in the great 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.370
 sea ​​are exactly the same words 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.799
 then they are the same it is possible that of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.959
 the European Union and the Middle East come out 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.760
 dominant or prominent sectors that 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.190
 they will rule over the earth a brief 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.769
 time span the world empire from 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.470
 the European Union and the Middle East now 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.240
 we see the map the passage of the kings of the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.910
 north and south of danielle's book 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.810
 they also give us clues about it I do not know 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.940
 what sectors 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.910
 of that European Union and the Middle East 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.740
 be these four beasts remember 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.110
 also the statue of Nebuchadnezzar 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.300
 from the head to the legs of 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.760
 iron ruled the known world 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.470
 from that single sector the only thing that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.810
 it changed was its geographical location 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.450
 within the same environment of europe and 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.580
 Middle East then nothing could 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.680
 suppose or prevent this from returning to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.050
 happen again but in brief lapses 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.570
 of time ranging from 5 to 7 years 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.669
 approximately or for a short time as 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.580
 we can corroborate this in the bible 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.889
 for the beast and those kings will rule 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.169
 one hour a brief time lapse nothing 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.419
 also prevents these sectors from having 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.940
 a brief lapse of time then the same 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.580
 Antichrist will only rule for one hour 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.580
 very little time this could answer to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.950
 the question of why in daniel 88 that 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.780
 says that of only 4 horns that come out of 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.260
 there comes this little horn the 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.630
 antichrist when in daniel 77 says that 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.330
 the antichrist comes out of 10 kings or horns 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.880
 taking the place of 3 100 daniel 88 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.380
 says it comes out of only 4 horn not 10 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.660
 and it's because those 3 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.180
 the previous ones that mean kings and 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.250
 that those kings by logic have a kingdom 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.170
 or empire could mean three 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.450
 sectors of that empire that will have 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.120
 separate hegemony for a brief period 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.220
 of time and they will rule the world each 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.770
 separately for brief little time and the 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.660
 fourth and last horn could mean 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.350
 that frightful and terrible beast of 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.300
 danielle 77 the lion could be a sector 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.220
 or an individual country of that part 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.980
 geographical of the world that will govern 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.600
 then it will come to another sector, that is, 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.000
 bear that apparently will have two 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.920
 rulers or hegemonic countries after 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.050
 we see the leopard that by what you read 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.150
 will have four hegemonic countries that 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.520
 will govern the other sectors of that 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.440
 empire and the whole world that's why he says 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.210
 that the four winds that fought in 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.730
 the great sea because those sectors 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.830
 internal geographies will fight for being 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.810
 the sole rulers of the empire and of 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.790
 world and in the end ten will rise 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.400
 hegemonic countries that dethroned 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.750
 those four hegemonic countries 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.660
 previous of that internal sector of 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.370
 Europe and Middle East then it will arrive 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.320
 the antichrist and three kings 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.900
 will recognize first of there 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.710
 remaining 7 ruling the entire world 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.840
 Daniel quotes 7 7 7 8 and 11 7 that's why 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.600
 that Europe and the Middle East will be partly 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.060
 strong and partly fragile that's why 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.040
 says that because in that empire the 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.050
 Europe and the Middle East will exist in 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.330
 internal wars to prove who is 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.460
 the one that commands of all for that will be in 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.190
 part strong and partly fragile by the 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.170
 internal struggles well here is a brief 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.270
 explanation of why the lion says 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.130
 and the bear are empires that will rise 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.470
 when traditional theology 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.870
 identified with Babylon and medo persia 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.000
 when the Babylonian empire had already 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.430
 fallen and the Persian medo that was the time 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.370
 where he governed and lived when he received 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.660
 this prophecy of danielle 7 was already 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.660
 raised waiting
