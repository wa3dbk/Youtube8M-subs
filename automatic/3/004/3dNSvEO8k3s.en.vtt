but<00:00:18.300> when<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.869> hit<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.050> jump<00:00:19.529> at<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.710> speed

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
but when it hit that jump at that speed

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.779 
but when it hit that jump at that speed
hit<00:00:20.760> piledrive<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> front<00:00:21.810> end<00:00:21.990> back<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> bit

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
hit piledrive the front end back a bit

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.939 
hit piledrive the front end back a bit
pushing<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> axle<00:00:24.420> back<00:00:24.570> causing<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> body

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
pushing the axle back causing the body

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.490 
pushing the axle back causing the body
the<00:00:26.430> sides<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> whole<00:00:27.150> body<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.720> break<00:00:28.289> off

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the sides of the whole body to break off

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
the sides of the whole body to break off
from<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.859> floor<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.840> right

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
from the floor as you can see right

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.389 
from the floor as you can see right
there<00:00:32.780> which<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.110> made<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> appear<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
there which then made it appear that the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.080 
there which then made it appear that the
seat<00:00:35.640> lifted<00:00:35.969> higher<00:00:36.180> towards<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> ceiling

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
seat lifted higher towards the ceiling

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
seat lifted higher towards the ceiling
so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.360> imagine<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.020> head<00:00:40.230> was

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so you can imagine if your head was

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.319 
so you can imagine if your head was
under<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.739> shelf<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> would<00:00:41.460> hit<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
under that shelf it would hit you in the

under that shelf it would hit you in the
back<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> neck<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.739> even<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> wasn't

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
back of the neck and even if it wasn't

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
back of the neck and even if it wasn't
you<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.059> hit<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.390> bed<00:00:45.989> contraption

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you would hit that bed contraption

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.790 
you would hit that bed contraption
that's<00:00:47.460> spring-loaded<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.200> easy<00:00:49.530> just

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that's spring-loaded that can easy just

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
that's spring-loaded that can easy just

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.839 
got like a foot of air underneath the
tires<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.169> front<00:03:43.380> end<00:03:43.620> checked<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.730> all

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
tires in the front end checked it all

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.729 
tires in the front end checked it all
out<00:03:44.880> afterwards<00:03:45.510> machine<00:03:46.169> seemed<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.620> be

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
out afterwards machine seemed to be

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.530 
out afterwards machine seemed to be
unfazed<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.639> completely<00:03:48.030> fine<00:03:48.329> condition

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
unfazed and completely fine condition

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.750 
unfazed and completely fine condition
afterwards<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:50.069> wanted<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.430> wait<00:03:50.549> till<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
afterwards so we wanted to wait till the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.220 
afterwards so we wanted to wait till the
next<00:03:50.910> weekend<00:03:51.359> where<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.599> was<00:03:51.690> sunny<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.109> dry

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
next weekend where it was sunny and dry

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.009 
next weekend where it was sunny and dry
so<00:03:52.560> he<00:03:52.680> could<00:03:52.799> go<00:03:52.889> as<00:03:53.040> fast<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.609> would<00:03:53.730> go

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
so he could go as fast as it would go

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.289 
so he could go as fast as it would go
and<00:03:55.099> I'm<00:03:56.099> guessing<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.639> hit<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.910> jump<00:03:57.150> at

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
and I'm guessing it hit the jump at

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.780 
and I'm guessing it hit the jump at
between<00:03:57.540> 80<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.109> 95<00:03:58.829> kilometers<00:03:59.489> an<00:03:59.579> hour<00:03:59.669> but

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
between 80 and 95 kilometers an hour but

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.810 
between 80 and 95 kilometers an hour but
I<00:04:00.090> just<00:04:00.389> don't<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:01.370> nobody<00:04:02.370> was<00:04:02.489> looking<00:04:02.729> at

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820
