00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.960
 greetings today is June 23, 2013 and in 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.270
 this video I will be talking about what 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.709
 is happening in atlantic as well as 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.749
 what we can expect for the rest of 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.160
 the season as we can see in this 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.200
 visible satellite image in the 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.209
 Atlantic we see that everything remains 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 quiet which is normal for the month 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.060
 of June 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 you see this whole region that lacks 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 areas inside nothing so that tells us 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 that there is no system that we are 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.680
 monitoring for possible development if 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 we have a tropical wave in this region 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 that as you can see is clearly noted 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.489
 the shape of a v upside down so it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.960
 tells us that the axis of the wave 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.970
 tropical is found in this region 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.710
 being tropical or moving towards 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.540
 the west during the next few days and it 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 it will be located here in the Caribbean without 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 However, the conditions are not going to be 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.150
 unfavorable for the development of this 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.120
 system and out of that look at all the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.650
 air all the desert dust of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.479
 Sahara that we have now in 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.580
 the Atlantic how should the 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.470
 months of June and July are the months 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.620
 assets in terms of amount of dust 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.479
 of the sahara so well we are in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 normal conditions this is normal but 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.470
 already by the end of June we see how it is going to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 begin to decrease the amount of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.900
 dust from the sahara as happens by 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.900
 every year 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.020
 from here and from here to a week or two 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 weeks we will be watching closely 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.360
 the gulf of mexico the caribbean area 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.979
 again that just like like 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.330
 happened with andrea who was 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.070
 developing in this region and we could 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.290
 see and develop in this region 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.390
 Well, again, we're going to have to 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.790
 monitor this region of the Atlantic 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.100
 because the geo is going to return to 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.090
 our area and like where does he know 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.219
 the shipping what promotes 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 area of ​​thunderstorms and low pressure is that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.659
 on many occasions they can help 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.250
 these systems to be organized that was what 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.960
 that we saw with Andrea in this region and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 also what we did with bari throughout 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.799
 this area so that's why we're going to 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 be watching very closely would be 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.829
 some models indicate that possibly 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.899
 let's do some kind of development 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.369
 possibly we will see another storm 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.409
 developing about this region 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.420
 but I go back and I repeat these models to 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.420
 long term so we only have left 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.720
 wait to see what happens 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.269
 see in this picture of the snow is the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.349
 European model and look like the model 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.780
 it tells us that we are going to be 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.880
 still moving 8 and yet 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.670
 number 1 so that tells us that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 we will be seeing air ascending in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.829
 this whole region and that also promotes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.540
 the formation of thunderstorms so when 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.819
 we see that the diego moves right 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.079
 so much we know that the Atlantic is 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.849
 is going to become a little more active in 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.440
 terms of low pressures and this 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.329
 can often help training 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.829
 from some tropical system too 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.290
 ENI have the model is that as 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.629
 you can see these colors to your green not 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.300
 present a positive movement of the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.630
 snow or air ascending nearby 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.370
 the Caribbean for also for the 4th to the 8th of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.540
 July so that tells us what 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.640
 purpose that we are going to have 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320
 arias of tronadas developing in 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.900
 this region and again possibly 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.700
 let's see then some system that deals 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.750
 to organize in this region so every 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 only time we 're going to be watching 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.500
 over the next few days and now we're going 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.380
 to be talking about the season 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.030
 hurricanes that what is going to be happening 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.530
 what is indicating during the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.910
 past days that the models we 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.070
 indicated that this season of 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.290
 hurricanes will be less active than 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.320
 Normal basically it is because 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.210
 many models say that the phenomenon of 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.970
 'the child' will begin to develop 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.280
 for September of October here in the in 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.440
 the pacific and that's possibly going to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.150
 have some effects in the ocean 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.160
 Atlantic which will reduce the number 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.750
 of systems however although the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.950
 models indicate that I was saying 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 that I did not agree with the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.350
 situation or with the measurement forecast 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.450
 basically I do not see reasons to give 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.070
 so that the Atlantic see less 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.090
 normal activity 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.920
 We are currently in some 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.080
 neutral conditions of the child as 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.190
 can see in this graph and it is expected 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.260
 that during the next months 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.870
 let's basically stay in one year 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.780
 neutral or a neutral months so 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.190
 that is telling us that the Atlantic 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.960
 perceives this the favorable for 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.910
 cyclonic development so by the 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.680
 moment for me it is very difficult that the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600
 El Niño is developed for the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.190
 peak of the season and therefore 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.490
 possibly yes we see enough 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.600
 cyclonic activity something curious that you 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.450
 I wanted to mention is one of the models 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.380
 that indicated more cyclonic activity 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.510
 it was the cfs model as you can see this 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.400
 was the forecast for last month and 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.050
 these colors that you see here in red 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.120
 and orange represent high pressures 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.470
 for the peak of the season so 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.460
 a month ago this model was 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.340
 indicating that we were going to have a 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.590
 very inactive season or below 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.870
 normal and how can we see the during 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.210
 this month the new forecast changed 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.980
 totally to a very similar forecast 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.560
 the one that I was indicating we have low 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.940
 pressure throughout this region so so 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.070
 that is telling us that this model 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.630
 Well, your suffering has changed 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.210
 attached to the idea that we've been 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.410
 mentioning basically all of the 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.720
 methodologies area that we are going to have 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.640
 low pressures throughout this region 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.560
 I also wanted to mention them because we're going to 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.360
 see again the ocean temperature 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.360
 notice, we continue in conditions 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.140
 child's neutrals throughout this region 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.000
 we continue with the tri pole in the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.400
 Atlantic with hot waters north 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.380
 cold water in mid-latitudes and water 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.160
 hot in low latitude and it stops 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.510
 let this continue 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.670
 that what we are going to expect is 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.020
 season then one of the reasons why 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.240
 which I think this season will 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.730
 Being active is the next reason if you 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.370
 they did in general we have cold waters in 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.510
 the Indian Ocean we also have water 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.510
 cold in this whole region 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.160
 on the contrary we have then waters 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.540
 hot in this area and hot waters 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.699
 in this region so that's what's 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.310
 indicating that if the ocean waters 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.620
 they remain as we have seen during the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.330
 after months, most of the time 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.639
 let's see what the air is going down 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.960
 in this region air rising towards the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.150
 atmosphere in this region air 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.280
 descending here and air ascending in 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.960
 this region so the temperature of the 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.990
 ocean when we have cold waters 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.030
 hot cold in this region and 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.070
 Warm up delay why it promotes 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.930
 that the air goes up into the atmosphere and 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.789
 helps the formation of thunderstorms throughout 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.729
 this Atlantic region just like 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.470
 here near the area of the filipina 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.750
 so these two areas that I'm 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.100
 marking the circle in red circles or 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.720
 the areas where we are going to see the greatest 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.789
 thunderstorm activity and low pressures 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.470
 and it's the main reason why I 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.449
 I think it's just season 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.340
 to be active I do not see reasons why 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.349
 not only that the phenomenon of the child 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.229
 how I come back and I repeat the phenomenon the child 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.729
 it will not develop for the peak the 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.930
 season so continue with my 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.910
 forecast that we're going to see a 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.940
 quite active season 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.190
 and by mid -July we're going 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.290
 to begin to see that Africa is going to start 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.910
 to send several strong tropical waves 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.270
 as our model that developed a 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.890
 system already for that from July 19 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.180
 obviously there is a long forecast 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.100
 term this does not mean that it is going to 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.660
 develop a system but if you already give us 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.820
 an idea that by the end of July we are going 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.010
 to begin to see more activity between 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.600
 Africa and the Caribbean and possibly the 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.790
 Cape Verde season starts a little 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.840
 before and by the end of June of July 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.690
 excuse me so let's continue 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.500
 with the preparations as you know 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.390
 possibly we will see some kind of 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.730
 development or at least let's see some 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.860
