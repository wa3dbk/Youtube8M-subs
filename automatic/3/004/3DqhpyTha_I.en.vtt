founding team of Tesla Motors and part
of<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.040> research<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.340> when<00:01:25.580> did<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.760> Tesla

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
of the research that when did the Tesla

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.940 
of the research that when did the Tesla
was<00:01:26.150> actually<00:01:26.510> from<00:01:26.869> our<00:01:27.170> shop<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.680> our<00:01:27.740> team

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
was actually from our shop and our team

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.740 
was actually from our shop and our team
so<00:01:28.400> there's<00:01:28.670> there's<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.060> myriad<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.690> reasons

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
so there's there's a myriad of reasons

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.480 
so there's there's a myriad of reasons
you've<00:01:30.080> got<00:01:30.260> in<00:01:30.500> education<00:01:31.100> you've<00:01:31.310> got

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
you've got in education you've got

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.399 
you've got in education you've got
technology<00:01:32.030> you've<00:01:32.180> got<00:01:32.330> racing<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.900> then<00:01:33.290> of

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
technology you've got racing and then of

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.510 
technology you've got racing and then of
course<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:34.159> an<00:01:34.250> awesome

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
course it's just and it's an awesome

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.550 
course it's just and it's an awesome

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
time spending late nights here working

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.960 
time spending late nights here working
on<00:01:36.680> projects<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.220> know<00:01:37.310> listening<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.729> music

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
on projects you know listening to music

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.990 
on projects you know listening to music
and<00:01:38.090> things<00:01:38.210> like<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.360> how<00:01:38.869> much<00:01:39.049> of<00:01:39.080> this<00:01:39.380> is

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
and things like that how much of this is

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.200 
and things like that how much of this is
aerodynamics<00:01:41.000> research<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.830> car<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:44.090> of

because<00:01:58.009> on<00:01:58.250> when<00:01:58.759> you're<00:01:58.880> cruising<00:01:59.180> on<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.299> car

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
because on when you're cruising on a car

because on when you're cruising on a car
like<00:01:59.900> this<00:01:59.960> about<00:02:00.590> 66<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.490> eighty<00:02:01.790> percent

like this about 66 to eighty percent

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.550 
like this about 66 to eighty percent
depending<00:02:02.299> on<00:02:02.570> what<00:02:02.689> tires<00:02:02.869> are<00:02:03.049> using<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.409> the

energy that the motor is using is going

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.520 
energy that the motor is using is going
to<00:02:05.509> pushing<00:02:05.780> air<00:02:05.960> out<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.229> way<00:02:06.350> so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
to pushing air out of the way so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650 
to pushing air out of the way so
aerodynamics<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.490> tremendously<00:02:08.149> important

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
aerodynamics is tremendously important

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.569 
aerodynamics is tremendously important
like<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> car<00:02:09.350> like<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.709> nose<00:02:10.130> mostly<00:02:10.489> because

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
like a car like this nose mostly because

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.039 
like a car like this nose mostly because
of<00:02:10.700> aerodynamics<00:02:11.269> gets<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.690> energy

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
of aerodynamics gets the energy

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.780 
of aerodynamics gets the energy
equivalent<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.590> about<00:02:12.709> 1,400<00:02:13.250> miles<00:02:13.670> per

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.569 
equivalent to about 1,400 miles per
gallon<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.410> go<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.040> could<00:02:16.190> go<00:02:16.310> most

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
gallon so you can go you could go most

a lot of things that kind of get lost

a lot of things that kind of get lost
along<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.450> way<00:02:29.570> because<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.049> have<00:02:30.169> all<00:02:30.380> sorts

don't have to make those trade-offs and

don't have to make those trade-offs and
we<00:02:38.540> can<00:02:38.690> make<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.290> most<00:02:39.440> perfect<00:02:39.920> aerodynamic

shape that's how we can get that kind of
performance<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.530> probably<00:02:42.800> helps<00:02:43.010> the

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
I'm definitely one of them we've got a

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.449 
I'm definitely one of them we've got a
guy<00:03:24.170> who's<00:03:24.410> taking<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:24.769> car<00:03:25.010> around<00:03:25.099> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
guy who's taking this car around the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.130 
guy who's taking this car around the
Laguna<00:03:26.060> Seca<00:03:26.209> racetrack<00:03:26.690> several<00:03:26.989> times

Laguna Seca racetrack several times

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.960 
Laguna Seca racetrack several times
really<00:03:27.410> quickly<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.340> do<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.819> as<00:03:28.940> well

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
really quickly so we do to that as well

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.059 
really quickly so we do to that as well
but<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.360> main<00:03:29.510> focus<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.799> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
but the main focus is is really on the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.220 
but the main focus is is really on the
really<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.940> solar<00:03:32.120> energy<00:03:32.239> part<00:03:32.660> tell<00:03:33.140> me

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
really on the solar energy part tell me

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.600 
really on the solar energy part tell me
about<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.530> solar<00:03:33.739> cells<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.370> how<00:03:34.549> the

about the solar cells and how the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.970 
about the solar cells and how the
technology<00:03:35.420> of<00:03:35.690> solar<00:03:36.019> has<00:03:36.260> changed<00:03:36.739> over<00:03:36.860> the

getting you know covering a solar car
with<00:03:49.609> panels<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.510> if<00:03:50.959> you're<00:03:51.079> talking

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
with panels and the if you're talking

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.120 
with panels and the if you're talking
about<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> progression<00:03:51.859> of<00:03:51.920> solar

solar car racing in 1989 the cars each

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.030 
solar car racing in 1989 the cars each
had<00:03:56.090> 12<00:03:56.420> square<00:03:56.780> meters<00:03:57.139> which<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.470> twice<00:03:57.680> this

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
had 12 square meters which is twice this

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.370 
had 12 square meters which is twice this
area<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.549> solar<00:03:59.000> panels<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.600> cars

area of solar panels and the cars

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.870 
area of solar panels and the cars
weighed<00:04:00.650> about<00:04:00.859> a<00:04:00.980> thousand<00:04:01.400> pounds<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:01.819> they

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
weighed about a thousand pounds and they

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.819 
weighed about a thousand pounds and they
only<00:04:02.030> went<00:04:02.239> 20<00:04:02.510> or<00:04:02.569> 30<00:04:02.720> miles<00:04:02.930> an<00:04:03.109> hour<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.470> now

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
only went 20 or 30 miles an hour and now

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.259 
only went 20 or 30 miles an hour and now
we<00:04:03.889> have<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.130> car<00:04:04.400> with<00:04:04.639> all<00:04:04.819> with<00:04:05.030> half<00:04:05.239> that

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
we have a car with all with half that

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.210 
we have a car with all with half that
amount<00:04:05.480> of<00:04:05.780> solar<00:04:05.900> area<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.829> weighs<00:04:07.010> half

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
amount of solar area and it weighs half

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.259 
amount of solar area and it weighs half
as<00:04:07.370> much<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.760> it's<00:04:07.850> going<00:04:08.000> they're<00:04:08.239> going

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
as much and it's going they're going

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.390 
as much and it's going they're going
highway<00:04:08.690> speeds<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.500> we<00:04:09.590> just<00:04:09.739> everything<00:04:10.220> has

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
highway speeds so we just everything has

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.559 
highway speeds so we just everything has
gotten<00:04:10.670> much<00:04:10.790> better<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.239> panels<00:04:11.510> have

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
gotten much better the panels have

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.670 
gotten much better the panels have
gotten<00:04:11.810> more<00:04:11.900> efficient<00:04:12.290> they've<00:04:12.410> gotten

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
gotten more efficient they've gotten

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.050 
gotten more efficient they've gotten
smoother<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.280> anti-reflective<00:04:13.760> coatings

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
smoother the anti-reflective coatings

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.550 
smoother the anti-reflective coatings
have<00:04:14.150> gotten<00:04:14.329> better<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:14.750> everything

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
have gotten better and just everything

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.529 
have gotten better and just everything
has<00:04:15.769> gotten<00:04:16.010> more<00:04:16.160> refined<00:04:16.579> in<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.880> last<00:04:17.060> 20

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
has gotten more refined in the last 20

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.089 
has gotten more refined in the last 20
years<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.959> that's<00:04:18.349> you<00:04:18.650> know<00:04:18.769> we're<00:04:18.950> getting

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
years and that's you know we're getting

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.400 
years and that's you know we're getting
to<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.340> point<00:04:19.549> where<00:04:19.700> these<00:04:20.419> things<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.959> car

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
to the point where these things a car

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.659 
to the point where these things a car
like<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.560> could<00:04:22.070> start<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.550> become

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
like this could start to become

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.070 
like this could start to become
practical<00:04:23.240> as<00:04:23.360> long<00:04:23.479> as<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.630> don't<00:04:23.810> have<00:04:23.960> air

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
practical as long as you don't have air

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.300 
practical as long as you don't have air
conditioning<00:04:24.200> we<00:04:24.590> had<00:04:24.680> air<00:04:24.800> conditioning<00:04:24.830> you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
conditioning we had air conditioning you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.710 
conditioning we had air conditioning you

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
know all bets are off for energy but

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.360 
know all bets are off for energy but
like<00:04:27.260> hard<00:04:27.440> without<00:04:27.530> air<00:04:27.889> conditioning<00:04:27.919> you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
like hard without air conditioning you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.909 
like hard without air conditioning you
could<00:04:28.520> probably<00:04:28.669> sell<00:04:28.940> one<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.090> these<00:04:29.800> tell<00:04:30.800> me

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
could probably sell one of these tell me

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.129 
could probably sell one of these tell me
do<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.490> store<00:04:32.060> any<00:04:32.330> power<00:04:32.570> does<00:04:32.930> their

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
do you store any power does their

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.900 
do you store any power does their
batteries<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.710> here<00:04:33.919> or<00:04:34.099> do<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.340> put<00:04:34.669> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
batteries in here or do you put the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.510 
batteries in here or do you put the
energy<00:04:35.270> straight<00:04:35.840> into<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.289> drive<00:04:36.740> wheels<00:04:37.010> so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
energy straight into the drive wheels so

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.580 
energy straight into the drive wheels so
the<00:04:37.669> car<00:04:37.849> has<00:04:38.090> about<00:04:38.419> five<00:04:38.660> kilowatt<00:04:39.169> hours<00:04:39.440> of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
the car has about five kilowatt hours of

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.260 
the car has about five kilowatt hours of
batteries<00:04:40.039> in<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.220> it's<00:04:40.340> about<00:04:40.520> 130<00:04:41.000> or<00:04:41.150> so

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
batteries in it it's about 130 or so

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.120 
batteries in it it's about 130 or so
laptop<00:04:41.720> batteries<00:04:42.050> from<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.650> macbook<00:04:43.010> pro

laptop batteries from a macbook pro

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.649 
laptop batteries from a macbook pro
actually<00:04:43.460> we<00:04:43.550> use<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.760> same<00:04:43.909> batteries<00:04:44.240> so

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
actually we use the same batteries so

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.630 
actually we use the same batteries so
you<00:04:44.750> can<00:04:45.080> drive<00:04:45.200> for<00:04:45.409> about<00:04:45.560> 150<00:04:45.979> miles<00:04:46.280> with

this particular car with
any<00:04:48.440> son<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:49.100> could<00:04:49.220> go<00:04:49.340> at<00:04:49.490> night<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:49.990> you

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
any son you could go at night and you

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.770 
any son you could go at night and you
use<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.500> have<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.620> buffer<00:04:52.010> for<00:04:52.780> because

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
use that to have a buffer for because

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.940 
use that to have a buffer for because
you're<00:04:53.900> only<00:04:54.050> allowed<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.380> drive<00:04:54.590> about<00:04:54.740> eight

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
you're only allowed to drive about eight

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.560 
you're only allowed to drive about eight
hours<00:04:55.070> per<00:04:55.250> day<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.670> solar<00:04:55.880> car<00:04:56.090> racing<00:04:56.420> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
hours per day in solar car racing and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.810 
hours per day in solar car racing and
but<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.350> Sun<00:04:57.500> is<00:04:57.530> up<00:04:57.770> for<00:04:58.220> much<00:04:58.460> longer<00:04:58.580> than

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
but the Sun is up for much longer than

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.130 
but the Sun is up for much longer than
that<00:04:58.880> so<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.150> can<00:04:59.270> charge<00:04:59.450> in<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.720> morning

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
that so you can charge in the morning

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.570 
that so you can charge in the morning
and<00:05:00.320> evening<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.860> then<00:05:00.950> use<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.100> power<00:05:01.430> to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and evening and then use that power to

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.770 
and evening and then use that power to
go<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> little<00:05:01.910> bit<00:05:02.090> faster<00:05:02.240> than<00:05:02.510> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
go a little bit faster than the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.220 
go a little bit faster than the
break-even<00:05:02.990> speed<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.680> next<00:05:03.890> day<00:05:05.020> is<00:05:06.020> really

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
break-even speed the next day is really

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.590 
break-even speed the next day is really
helpful<00:05:06.410> tell<00:05:06.980> me<00:05:07.100> about<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.430> motors<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.030> this

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
helpful tell me about the motors in this

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.440 
helpful tell me about the motors in this
car<00:05:08.840> way<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.530> there<00:05:09.830> any<00:05:10.420> research<00:05:11.420> that

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
car way is there any research that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.360 
car way is there any research that
you've<00:05:11.780> done<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.230> find<00:05:12.470> better<00:05:12.680> motors<00:05:13.100> and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
you've done to find better motors and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.880 
you've done to find better motors and
more<00:05:13.970> efficient<00:05:14.360> motors<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:15.170> so<00:05:15.500> the

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
more efficient motors and so the

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.230 
more efficient motors and so the
interest<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.490> cool<00:05:16.610> thing<00:05:16.730> about<00:05:16.790> solar<00:05:17.090> car

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
interest the cool thing about solar car

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.580 
interest the cool thing about solar car
racing<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:18.170> can<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.530> optimize

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
racing is that you can really optimize

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.850 
racing is that you can really optimize
for<00:05:19.450> efficiency<00:05:20.450> as<00:05:20.630> opposed<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.170> power<00:05:21.500> or

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
for efficiency as opposed to power or

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.920 
for efficiency as opposed to power or
some<00:05:22.130> other<00:05:22.220> things<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:22.880> since<00:05:23.150> about<00:05:23.390> 98

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
some other things so since about 98

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.600 
some other things so since about 98
