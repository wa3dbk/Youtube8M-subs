it changes both their size it usually

it changes both their size it usually
makes<00:02:12.220> them<00:02:12.400> very<00:02:12.490> big<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.970> pumps<00:02:13.300> them<00:02:13.450> up<00:02:13.569> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
makes them very big it pumps them up and

it makes them very very energetic what
we<00:02:17.260> want<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.560> understand<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.220> if<00:02:18.400> there's<00:02:18.610> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
we want to understand is if there's a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.540 
we want to understand is if there's a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
disturbance on the Sun how do we expect

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.309 
disturbance on the Sun how do we expect
the<00:02:21.670> Van<00:02:21.910> Allen<00:02:22.209> radiation<00:02:22.239> belt<00:02:22.840> particles

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.180 
the Van Allen radiation belt particles
to<00:02:23.470> change<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:26.530> they<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.890> change

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
to change and because they will change

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.440 
to change and because they will change
and<00:02:27.459> therefore<00:02:27.610> they<00:02:27.970> will<00:02:28.150> affect

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
and therefore they will affect

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.440 
and therefore they will affect
satellites<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.040> technologies<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.300> they're

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
learn how the belts change over space

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.110 
learn how the belts change over space
and<00:02:42.700> time<00:02:43.650> rbsp<00:02:44.650> will<00:02:45.190> let<00:02:45.340> scientists<00:02:45.850> answer

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and time rbsp will let scientists answer

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.729 
and time rbsp will let scientists answer
questions<00:02:46.600> surrounding<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.200> belts<00:02:47.500> that

questions surrounding the belts that

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.650 
questions surrounding the belts that

than half a century ago this mission

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.210 
than half a century ago this mission
really<00:02:52.480> will<00:02:52.690> give<00:02:52.989> us<00:02:53.170> those<00:02:53.590> answers<00:02:53.799> and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
really will give us those answers and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.250 
really will give us those answers and
that's<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.819> exciting<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.840> guess<00:02:55.870> that's<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
that's just exciting I guess that's the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.640 
that's just exciting I guess that's the
exciting<00:02:56.680> part<00:02:56.860> about<00:02:56.890> science<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.459> general
