all<00:00:04.400> right<00:00:04.549> I<00:00:04.640> got<00:00:04.759> the<00:00:04.880> one<00:00:05.029> side<00:00:05.240> mounted<00:00:05.600> up

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
all right I got the one side mounted up

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.240 
all right I got the one side mounted up
here<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.490> it's<00:00:07.490> almost<00:00:07.790> completely<00:00:08.180> wired<00:00:08.480> up

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
here and it's almost completely wired up

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.779 
here and it's almost completely wired up
and<00:00:10.250> I<00:00:11.080> got<00:00:12.080> all<00:00:12.199> of<00:00:12.650> these<00:00:12.799> wires<00:00:13.039> connected

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
and I got all of these wires connected

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.960 
and I got all of these wires connected
and<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.449> ones<00:00:14.629> out<00:00:14.809> of<00:00:14.869> the<00:00:15.640> factory<00:00:16.640> plugs

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
and the ones out of the factory plugs

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.790 
and the ones out of the factory plugs
are<00:00:17.380> yellow<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:18.590> brown<00:00:18.770> of<00:00:19.100> course<00:00:19.340> just<00:00:19.609> for

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
are yellow and brown of course just for

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.150 
are yellow and brown of course just for
matches<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.919> yellow<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.339> brown<00:00:22.519> going<00:00:23.449> into

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
matches the yellow and brown going into

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.519 
matches the yellow and brown going into
the<00:00:25.160> aftermarket<00:00:25.720> taillight<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.349> that's

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
the aftermarket taillight so that's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.620 
the aftermarket taillight so that's
really<00:00:27.710> easy<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.099> got<00:00:28.279> turn<00:00:29.060> signal<00:00:29.480> and

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
really easy you got turn signal and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.280 
really easy you got turn signal and
brake<00:00:29.659> and<00:00:30.640> then<00:00:31.750> running<00:00:32.750> lights<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.200> the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
brake and then running lights is the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.670 
brake and then running lights is the
brown<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.739> then<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:33.980> course<00:00:34.270> since<00:00:35.270> we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
brown and then of course since we

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.020 
brown and then of course since we
reconfigured<00:00:36.680> these<00:00:36.860> lights<00:00:37.100> just<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.820> little

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
reconfigured these lights just a little

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.170 
reconfigured these lights just a little
bit<00:00:38.150> we<00:00:38.300> know<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.690> red<00:00:39.400> is<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.730> reverse

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
bit we know that the red is the reverse

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.840 
bit we know that the red is the reverse
lights<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.840> then<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.560> black<00:00:42.770> wire<00:00:43.040> that<00:00:43.400> we

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
lights and then the black wire that we

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.180 
lights and then the black wire that we
ran<00:00:44.090> up<00:00:44.300> into<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.660> housing<00:00:45.080> is<00:00:45.230> a<00:00:45.650> negative

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
ran up into the housing is a negative

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.850 
ran up into the housing is a negative
and<00:00:46.720> for<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.780> negative<00:00:47.930> wire<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.290> just<00:00:48.650> drilled

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
and for the negative wire I just drilled

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.550 
and for the negative wire I just drilled
a<00:00:48.950> very<00:00:49.310> small<00:00:49.610> little<00:00:49.760> quarter-inch<00:00:50.240> hole

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
a very small little quarter-inch hole

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.070 
a very small little quarter-inch hole
right<00:00:51.560> here<00:00:51.830> in<00:00:52.040> between<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:53.570> two<00:00:53.690> factory

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
right here in between the two factory

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.700 
right here in between the two factory
plugs<00:00:55.180> ran<00:00:56.180> my<00:00:56.300> ground<00:00:56.570> wire<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.960> there<00:00:57.140> right

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
plugs ran my ground wire in there right

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.510 
plugs ran my ground wire in there right
now<00:00:57.890> I've<00:00:58.040> just<00:00:58.070> got<00:01:00.100> some<00:01:01.100> little<00:01:01.250> Spade

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
now I've just got some little Spade

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.999 
now I've just got some little Spade
connectors<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.600> there<00:01:03.410> so<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.800> can

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
connectors in there so that I can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.450 
connectors in there so that I can
disconnect<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:04.909> out<00:01:05.030> here<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:06.250> when<00:01:07.250> I'm<00:01:07.340> all

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
disconnect it out here and when I'm all

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.499 
disconnect it out here and when I'm all
finished<00:01:07.490> I'll<00:01:07.850> probably<00:01:07.999> put<00:01:08.179> a<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.270> bit

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
finished I'll probably put a little bit

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.830 
finished I'll probably put a little bit
of<00:01:08.570> electrical<00:01:08.990> tape<00:01:09.020> around<00:01:09.409> this<00:01:10.689> but<00:01:11.689> for

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
of electrical tape around this but for

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.730 
of electrical tape around this but for
now<00:01:11.929> I'm<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:12.049> gonna<00:01:12.229> leave<00:01:12.439> it<00:01:12.469> cuz<00:01:12.649> I'm

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
now I'm just gonna leave it cuz I'm

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.810 
now I'm just gonna leave it cuz I'm
probably<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> take<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.399> light<00:01:13.640> off

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
probably going to take this light off

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.469 
probably going to take this light off
one<00:01:14.749> more<00:01:14.899> time<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:16.520> this

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
one more time so that I can get this

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.130 
one more time so that I can get this
little<00:01:18.079> bit<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.380> sheathing<00:01:19.780> press<00:01:20.780> back<00:01:21.109> into

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
little bit of sheathing press back into

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.520 
little bit of sheathing press back into
the<00:01:21.530> housing<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.100> then<00:01:22.759> I've<00:01:22.880> got<00:01:23.119> some

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the housing and then I've got some

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.910 
the housing and then I've got some
convoluted<00:01:24.880> wire<00:01:25.880> sheathing<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.479> I'm<00:01:26.600> gonna

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
convoluted wire sheathing that I'm gonna

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.279 
convoluted wire sheathing that I'm gonna
wrap<00:01:27.920> around<00:01:27.979> all<00:01:28.609> these<00:01:28.909> wires<00:01:29.179> so<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.780> got

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
wrap around all these wires so we got

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.849 
wrap around all these wires so we got
all<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.499> finished<00:01:30.829> up<00:01:30.979> under<00:01:31.280> here<00:01:32.859> of

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
all that finished up under here of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.099 
all that finished up under here of
course<00:01:34.009> we<00:01:34.159> got<00:01:34.310> our<00:01:34.399> negative<00:01:34.759> wire<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.869> comes

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
course we got our negative wire it comes

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.929 
course we got our negative wire it comes
through<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.439> hole<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.859> that<00:01:37.310> grommet<00:01:37.759> and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
through that hole and that grommet and

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.840 
through that hole and that grommet and
then<00:01:38.719> we've<00:01:38.810> got<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:40.219> rest<00:01:40.429> of<00:01:40.520> our<00:01:40.609> wiring

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
then we've got the rest of our wiring

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.199 
then we've got the rest of our wiring
harness<00:01:43.990> together<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.549> runs<00:01:46.729> down<00:01:46.909> here

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
harness together and it runs down here

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.940 
harness together and it runs down here
along<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.630> frame<00:01:47.869> rail<00:01:48.049> I'll<00:01:48.229> need<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.530> clean

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
along the frame rail I'll need to clean

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.419 
along the frame rail I'll need to clean
this<00:01:49.069> up<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.369> get<00:01:49.490> some<00:01:49.639> little<00:01:49.840> wire<00:01:50.840> clamps

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
this up I get some little wire clamps

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.099 
this up I get some little wire clamps
well<00:01:52.429> put<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.270> know<00:01:53.450> put<00:01:53.539> a<00:01:53.689> bolt<00:01:53.929> through

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
well put you know put a bolt through

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.840 
well put you know put a bolt through
this<00:01:54.200> hole<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.409> clamp<00:01:55.069> these<00:01:55.219> wires<00:01:55.459> in<00:01:55.700> there

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
this hole and clamp these wires in there

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.919 
this hole and clamp these wires in there
and<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:56.869> probably<00:01:57.139> somewhere<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.649> here<00:01:57.799> also

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
and it's probably somewhere in here also

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.090 
and it's probably somewhere in here also
clean<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.079> off<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.529> grinder<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:00.950> make

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
clean this off with the grinder and make

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.379 
clean this off with the grinder and make
it<00:02:01.249> nice<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.429> smooth<00:02:01.789> with<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.939> good<00:02:02.090> ground

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
it nice and smooth with a good ground

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.649 
it nice and smooth with a good ground
location<00:02:03.009> which<00:02:04.009> is<00:02:04.159> where<00:02:04.670> I'll<00:02:04.789> connect

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
location which is where I'll connect

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.760 
location which is where I'll connect
this<00:02:05.779> wire<00:02:05.959> I'll<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.439> make<00:02:06.529> it<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.709> little

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
this wire I'll have to make it a little

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.529 
this wire I'll have to make it a little
bit<00:02:06.950> longer<00:02:07.189> but<00:02:07.520> I'm<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.240> worried<00:02:08.479> about

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
bit longer but I'm not worried about

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.280 
bit longer but I'm not worried about
that<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.659> you<00:02:11.659> need<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:11.930> some<00:02:12.080> cleanup

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that so just you need to do some cleanup

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.850 
that so just you need to do some cleanup
back<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:14.540> other<00:02:14.659> than<00:02:14.750> that

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
back here but other than that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.480 
back here but other than that
it's<00:02:16.280> totally<00:02:16.550> finished<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.030> uh<00:02:17.740> well<00:02:18.740> uh<00:02:18.770> I'm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
it's totally finished so uh well uh I'm

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.430 
it's totally finished so uh well uh I'm
nearly<00:02:20.360> finished<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> truck<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.260> really

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
nearly finished with the truck I really

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.330 
nearly finished with the truck I really
just<00:02:21.560> need<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> battery<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.690> some<00:02:23.690> new

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
just need to get a battery and some new

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.450 
just need to get a battery and some new
battery<00:02:25.340> cables<00:02:26.350> start<00:02:27.350> plugging<00:02:27.830> fuses<00:02:28.310> in

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
battery cables start plugging fuses in

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.610 
battery cables start plugging fuses in
and<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:29.270> happens<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.780> far<00:02:29.810> as<00:02:30.080> these

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and see what happens as far as these

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.560 
and see what happens as far as these
being<00:02:30.860> LEDs<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> did<00:02:31.730> not<00:02:31.910> buy<00:02:33.820> any<00:02:34.820> dummy<00:02:35.270> load

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
being LEDs I did not buy any dummy load

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.920 
being LEDs I did not buy any dummy load
resistors<00:02:36.110> I'm<00:02:36.940> wondering<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.540> all<00:02:38.720> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
resistors I'm wondering if all that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.250 
resistors I'm wondering if all that
circuit<00:02:39.410> board<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> dummy

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
circuit board if if there is a dummy

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780 
circuit board if if there is a dummy
load<00:02:42.500> resistor<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.250> anyway

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
load resistor in there anyway

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.720 
load resistor in there anyway
if<00:02:43.850> there's<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:45.830> we'll<00:02:46.220> find<00:02:46.460> out<00:02:46.580> it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
if there's not we'll find out it's

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.350 
if there's not we'll find out it's
really<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> turn<00:02:47.300> signals<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.870> hazards

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
really the turn signals and the hazards

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.480 
really the turn signals and the hazards
it'll<00:02:50.360> blink<00:02:50.600> real<00:02:51.020> fast<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:52.370> if

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
it'll blink real fast like like if

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.900 
it'll blink real fast like like if
you've<00:02:52.640> got<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:53.470> taillight<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.530> or<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.160> turn

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you've got a taillight out or a turn

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.490 
you've got a taillight out or a turn
signal<00:02:56.060> bulb<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.690> could<00:02:56.960> be<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> front<00:02:57.350> in

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
signal bulb out could be the front in

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.310 
signal bulb out could be the front in
the<00:02:57.560> back<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> got<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.360> realize<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.260> a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
the back because you got to realize it a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.140 
the back because you got to realize it a
light<00:03:01.160> bulb<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.580> basically<00:03:01.820> just<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
light bulb it's basically just a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.360 
light bulb it's basically just a
resistor<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:07.190> turn

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
resistor and so it's it's not the turn

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.450 
resistor and so it's it's not the turn
signal<00:03:07.760> relay<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:09.770> picking<00:03:10.100> up<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.340> that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
signal relay is not picking up on that

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.160 
signal relay is not picking up on that
resistance<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.330> thinks<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.750> there's<00:03:11.960> a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
resistance so it thinks that there's a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.800 
resistance so it thinks that there's a
bulb<00:03:12.980> burned<00:03:13.250> out<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.850> also<00:03:13.970> get

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.330 

turn<00:03:17.810> signal<00:03:18.170> turn<00:03:18.470> signal<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:18.950> hazard

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
turn signal turn signal and hazard

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.600 
turn signal turn signal and hazard
relays<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.790> are<00:03:20.090> specific<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:21.340> LED<00:03:22.340> lights

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
relays that are specific for LED lights

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.490 
relays that are specific for LED lights
which<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.000> that's<00:03:23.510> what<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:23.990> I'm<00:03:24.110> gonna<00:03:24.320> do

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
which I that's what I think I'm gonna do

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.990 
which I that's what I think I'm gonna do
because<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.800> think<00:03:24.830> I'm<00:03:25.250> pretty<00:03:25.700> sure<00:03:25.850> I've

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
because I think I'm pretty sure I've

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.280 
because I think I'm pretty sure I've
seen<00:03:26.030> those<00:03:26.300> at<00:03:26.390> my<00:03:26.480> local<00:03:26.690> auto<00:03:26.930> parts<00:03:27.020> store

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
seen those at my local auto parts store

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.960 
seen those at my local auto parts store
so<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.650> don't<00:03:27.830> have<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.040> order<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.400> online<00:03:28.580> or

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
so I don't have to order that online or

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.750 
so I don't have to order that online or
anything<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:31.190> uh<00:03:31.250> I'll<00:03:31.880> plug<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
anything but uh I'll plug in the the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.790 
anything but uh I'll plug in the the
turn<00:03:35.180> signal<00:03:35.510> relays<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.170> came<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
turn signal relays that came with the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.660 
turn signal relays that came with the
kit<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:38.800> we'll<00:03:39.800> just<00:03:39.980> see<00:03:40.100> what<00:03:40.220> happens<00:03:40.490> if

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
kit and we'll just see what happens if

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.970 
kit and we'll just see what happens if
they<00:03:40.760> work<00:03:40.970> then<00:03:41.590> awesome<00:03:42.590> if<00:03:42.680> they<00:03:42.800> don't

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
they work then awesome if they don't

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.640 
they work then awesome if they don't
then<00:03:43.420> I'll<00:03:44.420> get<00:03:44.540> another<00:03:44.630> relay<00:03:45.200> or<00:03:45.350> I'll<00:03:45.500> get

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
then I'll get another relay or I'll get

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.730 
then I'll get another relay or I'll get
a<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.830> dummy<00:03:46.760> load<00:03:46.970> resistor<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.600> we'll<00:03:48.590> make

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
a a dummy load resistor and we'll make

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.100 
a a dummy load resistor and we'll make
them<00:03:48.830> work<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.570> but<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.660> tail<00:03:50.780> lights<00:03:50.990> are

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
them work so but the tail lights are

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.300 
them work so but the tail lights are
just<00:03:51.140> about<00:03:51.530> finished<00:03:51.680> I'm<00:03:51.920> gonna<00:03:52.010> put<00:03:52.220> the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
just about finished I'm gonna put the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.630 
just about finished I'm gonna put the
other<00:03:52.340> side<00:03:52.670> on<00:03:52.850> but<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.890> know<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.490> all

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
other side on but you know it's all

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.690 
other side on but you know it's all
wired<00:03:55.880> up<00:03:56.060> down<00:03:56.780> there<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:58.610> just

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
wired up down there and it's just

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.699 
wired up down there and it's just
mounting<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.900> bracket<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.290> that's<00:04:00.590> no

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
mounting it to the bracket so that's no

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.670 
mounting it to the bracket so that's no
big<00:04:00.890> deal<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.780> stay<00:04:02.780> tuned<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.110> I'll<00:04:03.230> get<00:04:03.650> a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
big deal so stay tuned and I'll get a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.620 
big deal so stay tuned and I'll get a
battery<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.280> we'll<00:04:05.060> test<00:04:05.240> out<00:04:05.390> all<00:04:05.420> these

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
battery and we'll test out all these

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.020 
battery and we'll test out all these
circuits
