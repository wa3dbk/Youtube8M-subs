00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
in the same time period as me chances

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
in the same time period as me chances
are<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.369> might<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.090> these<00:00:21.390> lying

are you might have some of these lying

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.400 
are you might have some of these lying
around<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.010> eight<00:00:23.250> millimeter

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
around this is an eight millimeter

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
around this is an eight millimeter
camcorder<00:00:25.410> tape<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:26.519> ain't<00:00:26.760> no<00:00:26.820> meter

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
camcorder tape these ain't no meter

camcorder tape these ain't no meter
tapes<00:00:28.519> only<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:30.150> lying

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tapes only you will have them lying

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.799 
tapes only you will have them lying
around<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.900> house<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.850> I<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.149> well<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
around your house and I do as well and I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.510 
around your house and I do as well and I
recently<00:00:34.050> unearthed<00:00:34.800> them<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.280> actually

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
recently unearthed them I actually

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.880 
recently unearthed them I actually
didn't<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.590> had<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.570> I

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
didn't really know we had them and I

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.549 
didn't really know we had them and I
needed<00:00:40.890> something<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.700> play<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
needed something to play them on and I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.910 
needed something to play them on and I
decided<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.579> wanted<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> digitize<00:00:45.210> them

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
decided that I wanted to digitize them

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
decided that I wanted to digitize them
because<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.370> problem<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.789> anything<00:00:48.059> analog

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because the problem with anything analog

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600 
because the problem with anything analog
like<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> eventually<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.100> breaks<00:00:50.219> down

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like this is eventually it breaks down

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.330 
like this is eventually it breaks down
and<00:00:50.940> eventually<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:52.289> degrade<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> point

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and eventually will degrade to the point

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.310 
and eventually will degrade to the point
where<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.640> unwatchable<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.719> tape<00:00:54.989> will

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
where it's unwatchable the tape will

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.209 
where it's unwatchable the tape will
break<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:57.140> you'll<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.920> where

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
break or you'll get to the point where

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
break or you'll get to the point where
it's<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.120> obsolete<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.750> nothing<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.469> play

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
it's so obsolete that nothing will play

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
it's so obsolete that nothing will play

but<00:01:15.240> I've<00:01:15.420> digitized<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> box<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.830> dump

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
but I've digitized a box so I can dump

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
but I've digitized a box so I can dump
it<00:01:17.670> straight<00:01:17.790> onto<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> Mac<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.200> boxes

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it straight onto the Mac there are boxes

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
it straight onto the Mac there are boxes
out<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.369> take<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.820> analog

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
out there that will take an analog

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
out there that will take an analog
source<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> USB<00:01:23.369> or

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
source and put it through a USB or

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200 
source and put it through a USB or
firewire<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.750> Mac<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> PC<00:01:25.759> I'd<00:01:26.759> only<00:01:27.030> have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
firewire to a Mac or a PC I'd only have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.870 
firewire to a Mac or a PC I'd only have
to<00:01:27.240> pay<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.670> did<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
started to degrade and that you know

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.399 
started to degrade and that you know
detecting<00:05:49.180> that<00:05:49.270> sometimes<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> little<00:05:50.050> bit

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
detecting that sometimes is a little bit

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.439

a<00:05:50.620> little<00:05:51.069> bit<00:05:51.190> off<00:05:51.370> but<00:05:51.639> now<00:05:52.060> we're<00:05:52.300> recording

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
a little bit off but now we're recording

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.170 
a little bit off but now we're recording
to<00:05:52.900> a<00:05:52.930> DVD<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.860> is<00:05:54.039> digitized<00:05:54.699> because

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
to a DVD and this is digitized because

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.939 
to a DVD and this is digitized because
now<00:05:55.750> that<00:05:55.990> you're<00:05:56.080> putting<00:05:56.319> it<00:05:56.500> onto<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.740> DVD

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
now that you're putting it onto a DVD

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.089 
now that you're putting it onto a DVD
into<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.490> digital<00:05:57.879> format<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:58.569> it<00:05:59.319> won't

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
into the digital format so it won't

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.820 
into the digital format so it won't
degrade<00:06:00.729> provided<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.779> disc<00:06:02.020> is<00:06:02.229> taken<00:06:02.650> care

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
degrade provided the disc is taken care

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.430 
degrade provided the disc is taken care
of<00:06:02.979> let's<00:06:03.430> stop<00:06:03.759> recording<00:06:03.939> on<00:06:04.779> DVD<00:06:05.169> player
