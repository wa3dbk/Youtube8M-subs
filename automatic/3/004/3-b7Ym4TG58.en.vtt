the way to the spawn without stamina up
and<00:01:16.890> what's<00:01:17.040> weird<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> five<00:01:18.090> dentists<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and what's weird is five dentists and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
and what's weird is five dentists and
zombies<00:01:18.990> latch<00:01:19.290> onto<00:01:19.590> my<00:01:19.770> head<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
zombies latch onto my head so what I was

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
zombies latch onto my head so what I was
able<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.909> figure<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> test<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
able to figure out from this test is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
able to figure out from this test is
that<00:01:22.619> stamina<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.340> doesn't<00:01:23.790> help<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> avoid

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that stamina up doesn't help you avoid

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
that stamina up doesn't help you avoid
the<00:01:24.299> denison<00:01:24.780> zombies<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> little

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the denison zombies so this is a little

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
the denison zombies so this is a little
bit<00:01:26.369> surprising<00:01:26.790> oftentimes<00:01:27.600> you'll<00:01:27.780> notice

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
bit surprising oftentimes you'll notice

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.319 
bit surprising oftentimes you'll notice
people<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.680> stamina<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> avoid<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
people you stamina up to avoid the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.789 
people you stamina up to avoid the
denizens<00:01:30.840> aam<00:01:30.990> beasts<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.560> don't

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
denizens aam beasts but now we don't

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649 
denizens aam beasts but now we don't
have<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.759> basically<00:01:32.850> free<00:01:33.479> up

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
have to and this will basically free up

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
have to and this will basically free up
one<00:01:34.259> perk<00:01:34.590> slot<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
one perk slot and now you can use that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
one perk slot and now you can use that
to<00:01:35.880> maybe<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.299> double<00:01:36.630> tap<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.079> slide<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> hand

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to maybe get double tap or slide a hand

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.109 
to maybe get double tap or slide a hand
which<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.369> perk<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.030> have

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
which other perk you would have

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600
