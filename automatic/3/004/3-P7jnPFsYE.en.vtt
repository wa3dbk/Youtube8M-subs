Sun jar project all completed and done
and<00:00:34.379> here<00:00:35.379> it<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.590> still<00:00:36.220> using<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.610> same

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
and here it is still using the same

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.290 
and here it is still using the same
solar<00:00:37.090> panel<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:39.040> got<00:00:39.790> another<00:00:39.940> super

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
solar panel the got another super

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.329 
solar panel the got another super
capacitor<00:00:40.839> for<00:00:41.019> testing<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.680> apparently

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
capacitor for testing and apparently

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.799 
capacitor for testing and apparently
they've<00:00:42.519> changed<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.089> casing<00:00:43.449> just<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.629> little

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
they've changed the casing just a little

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.280 
they've changed the casing just a little
bit<00:00:43.900> nice<00:00:44.470> and<00:00:44.650> shiny<00:00:44.830> now<00:00:45.129> but<00:00:46.089> still<00:00:47.079> using

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
bit nice and shiny now but still using

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.340 
bit nice and shiny now but still using
the<00:00:47.589> two<00:00:48.010> point<00:00:48.280> seven<00:00:48.579> volt<00:00:48.629> 350<00:00:49.629> farad<00:00:49.960> see

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
the two point seven volt 350 farad see

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.569 
the two point seven volt 350 farad see
if<00:00:50.409> I<00:00:50.470> can<00:00:50.559> get<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.739> without<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> reflection

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
if I can get it without the reflection

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.420 
if I can get it without the reflection
super<00:00:52.570> capacitor<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.680> I<00:00:54.040> got<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.280> newer

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
super capacitor and I got the newer

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.270 
super capacitor and I got the newer
circuit<00:00:54.850> board<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.900> let<00:00:56.409> me<00:00:56.470> turn<00:00:56.619> the<00:00:56.799> camera

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
circuit board so let me turn the camera

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.520 
circuit board so let me turn the camera
around<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.790> show<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.960> off<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.049> little<00:00:59.170> bit<00:00:59.320> more

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
around and show it off a little bit more

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.380 
around and show it off a little bit more
for<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:01.559> okay<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:03.250> said<00:01:03.430> before<00:01:03.549> I'm<00:01:04.119> still

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
for you okay that said before I'm still

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.250 
for you okay that said before I'm still
using<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.780> same<00:01:05.290> solar<00:01:06.100> panel<00:01:06.869> same<00:01:07.869> chipper

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
using the same solar panel same chipper

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.250 
using the same solar panel same chipper
capacitor<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.820> now<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.150> have<00:01:10.420> my<00:01:10.570> new<00:01:10.869> board

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
capacitor and now I have my new board

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.500 
capacitor and now I have my new board
and<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:12.369> best<00:01:12.549> thing<00:01:12.729> about<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.360> can

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
and the best thing about this is I can

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.600 
and the best thing about this is I can
take<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:13.780> LED<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.530> bend<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.460> way

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
take this LED and bend it out of the way

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.910 
take this LED and bend it out of the way
without<00:01:16.060> hurting<00:01:16.600> anything<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:17.710> way<00:01:17.860> you

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
without hurting anything so this way you

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.890 
without hurting anything so this way you
can<00:01:18.009> actually<00:01:18.070> see<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:19.090> board<00:01:19.360> actually

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
can actually see it the board actually

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.440 
can actually see it the board actually
now<00:01:20.200> sits<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.979> top<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> super<00:01:21.909> capacitor

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
now sits on top of the super capacitor

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.780 
now sits on top of the super capacitor
turn<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.290> around<00:01:23.409> here<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:24.400> can<00:01:24.549> see<00:01:24.670> it's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
turn it around here you can see it's

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.469 
turn it around here you can see it's
actually<00:01:25.020> mounted<00:01:26.020> right<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.270> super

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
actually mounted right to the super

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.739 
actually mounted right to the super
capacitor<00:01:28.899> by<00:01:29.020> two<00:01:29.710> pins<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.850> everything<00:01:31.659> is

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
capacitor by two pins so everything is

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.599 
capacitor by two pins so everything is
now<00:01:31.869> integrated<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.829> only<00:01:33.039> two<00:01:33.159> wires<00:01:33.369> you

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
now integrated the only two wires you

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.160 
now integrated the only two wires you
have<00:01:33.640> are<00:01:34.030> coming<00:01:34.299> from<00:01:34.359> the<00:01:34.539> solar<00:01:34.810> panel

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
have are coming from the solar panel

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.550 
have are coming from the solar panel
itself<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:36.570> everything<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.810> nice<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.079> tight

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
itself and everything is nice and tight

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.020 
itself and everything is nice and tight
and<00:01:39.310> works<00:01:39.729> beautifully<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.890> let<00:01:42.759> me<00:01:42.819> bring<00:01:42.939> up

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
and works beautifully so let me bring up

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.069 
and works beautifully so let me bring up
the<00:01:43.149> camera<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.390> little<00:01:43.450> bit<00:01:43.569> more<00:01:43.840> are<00:01:44.020> you

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
the camera a little bit more are you

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.529 
the camera a little bit more are you
sure<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.380> on<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.710> off<00:01:44.799> on<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.270> bring<00:01:46.270> up<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
sure the on and off on it bring up to

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.330 
sure the on and off on it bring up to
the<00:01:46.630> light<00:01:46.810> here<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:49.060> we<00:01:49.179> go<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.890> can

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
the light here there we go and you can

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.099 
the light here there we go and you can
see<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.179> see<00:01:52.299> if<00:01:52.359> it'll<00:01:52.479> focus<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:53.020> me

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
see it on it see if it'll focus for me

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.550 
see it on it see if it'll focus for me
there<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.200> go

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
there we go

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
there we go
if<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:57.159> bring<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.429> more<00:01:57.700> see<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.359> turns<00:01:58.569> off

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
if I bring it more see it turns off

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.789 
if I bring it more see it turns off
sound<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.659> only<00:02:01.689> off<00:02:01.960> circuitry<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.530> also

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
sound the only off circuitry is also

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:11.040 
sound the only off circuitry is also
working<00:02:03.009> great<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.630> actual<00:02:10.929> unit

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
working great so this is the actual unit

in<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.450> center<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.990> took<00:02:56.590> my<00:02:56.740> first<00:02:57.370> prototype

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
in the center I took my first prototype

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.300 
in the center I took my first prototype
and<00:02:58.210> encased<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.320> casting<00:02:59.770> resin<00:02:59.920> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
and encased it in a casting resin and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.830 
and encased it in a casting resin and
that<00:03:00.880> will<00:03:01.030> show<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.270> how<00:03:01.450> much<00:03:01.600> light<00:03:01.810> that

just<00:03:19.840> as<00:03:19.960> a<00:03:19.990> light<00:03:20.260> comparison<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.460> they're

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
just as a light comparison so they're

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.520 
just as a light comparison so they're
putting<00:03:22.180> out<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.420> same<00:03:22.630> amount<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.930> light<00:03:23.110> or

putting out the same amount of light or

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.550 
putting out the same amount of light or
maybe<00:03:23.740> just<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.100> bit<00:03:24.430> more<00:03:25.320> your<00:03:26.320> choice

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
maybe just a little bit more your choice

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.470 
maybe just a little bit more your choice
is<00:03:26.740> always<00:03:27.190> for<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:29.550> it's<00:03:30.550> your<00:03:30.640> choice<00:03:30.940> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
is always for the it's your choice to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.270 
is always for the it's your choice to
figure<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:31.870> how<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.110> want<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.680> diffuse<00:03:33.070> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
figure out how you want to diffuse the

figure out how you want to diffuse the
light<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:35.680> other<00:03:35.710> photo<00:03:36.310> you'll<00:03:37.060> see

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
light and the other photo you'll see

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
light and the other photo you'll see
here<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.780> put<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.260> unit<00:03:38.740> in<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:40.020> frosted<00:03:41.020> wire

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
here I put this unit in a frosted wire

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.110 
here I put this unit in a frosted wire
bound<00:03:41.620> jar<00:03:41.950> basically<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.730> just<00:03:42.850> got<00:03:43.000> that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
bound jar basically I just got that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.630 
bound jar basically I just got that
frosting<00:03:43.630> spray<00:03:43.930> spray<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.890> inside<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
frosting spray spray it inside and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.790 
frosting spray spray it inside and
masked<00:03:46.270> off<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.960> what<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.290> actually<00:03:47.680> the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
masked off and what is actually the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.100 
masked off and what is actually the
bottom<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.400> jar<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.330> clear<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.960> I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
bottom of the jar so it's clear and I

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.440 
bottom of the jar so it's clear and I
mounted<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.410> solar<00:03:50.740> panel<00:03:51.130> inside<00:03:51.850> on<00:03:52.060> top<00:03:52.270> of

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
mounted the solar panel inside on top of

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.050 
mounted the solar panel inside on top of
that<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:53.530> let<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.770> LED<00:03:54.220> down<00:03:54.460> like<00:03:54.940> you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that and just let the LED down like you

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.380 
that and just let the LED down like you
see<00:03:55.240> it<00:03:55.390> as<00:03:55.510> right<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.850> diffuses

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
see it as right now and it diffuses

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.440 
see it as right now and it diffuses
quite<00:03:58.630> nicely<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.410> that's<00:03:59.980> about<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:01.180> amount

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
quite nicely and that's about the amount

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.660 
quite nicely and that's about the amount
of<00:04:01.540> light<00:04:01.780> it'll<00:04:01.990> put<00:04:02.320> out<00:04:02.470> remember<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.250> camera

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
of light it'll put out remember a camera

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.890 
of light it'll put out remember a camera
will<00:04:03.880> compensate<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.540> bit<00:04:04.780> for

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
will compensate a little bit for

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.160 
will compensate a little bit for
low-light<00:04:05.790> conditions<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:08.020> actually

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
low-light conditions but it actually

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.960 
low-light conditions but it actually
works<00:04:08.530> really<00:04:08.980> well<00:04:09.250> especially<00:04:09.520> if<00:04:09.850> you're

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
works really well especially if you're

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.540 
works really well especially if you're
in<00:04:10.030> complete<00:04:10.360> darkness<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.890> will<00:04:11.920> be<00:04:12.160> able<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
in complete darkness you will be able to

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.020 
in complete darkness you will be able to
see<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:12.880> actually<00:04:13.120> read<00:04:13.300> a<00:04:13.330> book<00:04:13.570> with<00:04:13.750> this

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
see and actually read a book with this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.380 
see and actually read a book with this
over<00:04:16.030> here<00:04:16.359> we<00:04:17.290> have<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.530> frosted<00:04:18.340> wire<00:04:19.090> bound

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
over here we have a frosted wire bound

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.660 
over here we have a frosted wire bound
class<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.430> top<00:04:21.640> clear<00:04:23.220> mount<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.370> inside

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
class with the top clear mount it inside

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.210 
class with the top clear mount it inside
there<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.720> LED<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.890> green<00:04:27.100> is

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
there that's the LED and the green is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.430 
there that's the LED and the green is
actually<00:04:27.370> reflection<00:04:28.120> from<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.870> super<00:04:29.260> cap

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
actually reflection from the super cap

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.890 
actually reflection from the super cap
and<00:04:30.750> over<00:04:31.750> here<00:04:32.250> we<00:04:33.250> have<00:04:33.280> solar<00:04:34.270> panel<00:04:34.690> top

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
and over here we have solar panel top

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.950 
and over here we have solar panel top

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and the device itself actually encased

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.190 
and the device itself actually encased
and<00:04:38.320> casting<00:04:39.130> rest<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.810> like<00:04:41.050> the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
and casting rest this is like the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.880 
and casting rest this is like the
ultimate<00:04:42.960> weatherproof<00:04:43.960> weather<00:04:44.290> resistant

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
ultimate weatherproof weather resistant

now<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.730> only<00:04:45.970> thing<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.150> haven't<00:04:46.419> had<00:04:46.510> a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
now the only thing I haven't had a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.469 
now the only thing I haven't had a
chance<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.840> do<00:04:46.960> yet<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.669> frost<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.970> sides<00:04:49.000> and

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
chance to do yet is frost the sides and

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.940 
chance to do yet is frost the sides and
like<00:04:49.630> scratched<00:04:50.020> up<00:04:50.229> this<00:04:50.440> way<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.710> get<00:04:50.890> more

like scratched up this way you get more

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.640 
like scratched up this way you get more
of<00:04:51.130> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
of a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.320 
of a
reflection<00:04:52.130> like<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.400> would<00:04:52.550> with<00:04:52.729> this<00:04:52.940> but

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
reflection like you would with this but

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.020 
reflection like you would with this but
this<00:04:54.050> will<00:04:54.229> show<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.919> is<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.100> dark

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
this will show you this is a dark

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.060 
this will show you this is a dark
bedroom<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.979> lights<00:04:58.220> up<00:04:58.370> very<00:04:58.669> well<00:05:00.070> so

product<00:05:02.660> I'm<00:05:03.050> gonna<00:05:03.289> be<00:05:03.350> making<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.680> few<00:05:03.800> of

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
product I'm gonna be making a few of

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.920 
product I'm gonna be making a few of
these<00:05:03.979> for<00:05:04.190> myself<00:05:04.310> I'm<00:05:05.090> basically<00:05:05.660> gonna<00:05:05.840> be

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
these for myself I'm basically gonna be

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.469 
these for myself I'm basically gonna be
encasing<00:05:06.470> all<00:05:06.620> them<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.280> resin<00:05:07.759> so<00:05:08.300> this

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
encasing all them in the resin so this

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.210 
encasing all them in the resin so this
way<00:05:08.660> they<00:05:08.930> are<00:05:08.990> all<00:05:09.229> completely<00:05:09.500> moisture

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
way they are all completely moisture

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.279 
way they are all completely moisture
protected<00:05:10.789> and<00:05:11.060> they're<00:05:11.479> basically<00:05:11.810> Bowl<00:05:12.139> /

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
protected and they're basically Bowl /

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.930 
protected and they're basically Bowl /
if<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.470> can<00:05:12.590> drop<00:05:12.800> them<00:05:13.009> and<00:05:13.280> you're<00:05:13.820> not

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
if you can drop them and you're not

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.670 
if you can drop them and you're not
gonna<00:05:14.030> hurt<00:05:14.300> anything<00:05:14.630> they're<00:05:15.440> going<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.620> be

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
gonna hurt anything they're going to be

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.860 
gonna hurt anything they're going to be
used<00:05:15.860> mostly<00:05:16.190> for<00:05:16.280> camping<00:05:16.880> so<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.479> can<00:05:17.750> put

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
used mostly for camping so I can put

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.090 
used mostly for camping so I can put
them<00:05:17.960> out<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.229> Sun<00:05:18.410> during<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.770> daytime
