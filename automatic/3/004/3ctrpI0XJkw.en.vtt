00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.860 
centimetres of Tiger Tail and then I'll
just<00:02:13.019> throw<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> crimp<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.370> end<00:02:14.870> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
just throw it on a crimp at the end and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.860 
just throw it on a crimp at the end and
then<00:02:16.860> onto<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.310> I'm<00:02:17.550> gonna<00:02:17.760> thread<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
then onto that I'm gonna thread on the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.059 
then onto that I'm gonna thread on the
five<00:02:19.739> by<00:02:20.040> ten<00:02:20.340> millimeter<00:02:21.060> teardrop<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.080> then

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
five by ten millimeter teardrop and then

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.220 
five by ten millimeter teardrop and then
taking<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.210> first<00:02:25.170> part

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
taking this first part

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.789 
taking this first part
just<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.250> back<00:02:27.430> into<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.650> he

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
just going back into that so that he

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.940 
just going back into that so that he
turns<00:02:30.219> around<00:02:30.430> into<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> loop<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:32.799> going

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
turns around into a loop so that's going

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.069 
turns around into a loop so that's going
to<00:02:33.010> make<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.849> nice<00:02:34.000> tassel<00:02:34.569> it

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
to make it so it's a nice tassel it

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.500 
to make it so it's a nice tassel it
seemed<00:02:35.409> so<00:02:36.129> it's<00:02:36.310> teardrop<00:02:36.849> down<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> bottom

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
seemed so it's teardrop down the bottom

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.920 
seemed so it's teardrop down the bottom
so<00:02:38.409> I'll<00:02:38.530> creep<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:38.980> down<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.599> then

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
so I'll creep that down there and then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.699 
so I'll creep that down there and then
we're<00:02:41.140> going<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.349> cut<00:02:41.530> off<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:43.319> first<00:02:44.319> bit<00:02:44.680> of

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
we're going to cut off this first bit of

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.550 
we're going to cut off this first bit of
wire<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.340> there's<00:02:45.519> just<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.909> longer<00:02:46.269> pieces

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
wire so there's just the longer pieces

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.020 
wire so there's just the longer pieces
extending<00:02:47.560> from<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.430> I've<00:02:48.519> got<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> longer

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
extending from it so I've got the longer

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.679 
extending from it so I've got the longer
piece<00:02:49.209> there<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.670> what<00:02:51.670> we're<00:02:51.819> gonna<00:02:51.909> do<00:02:52.180> is

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
piece there and what we're gonna do is

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.050 
piece there and what we're gonna do is
I'm<00:02:53.170> gonna<00:02:53.439> thread<00:02:53.829> on<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.340> beads<00:02:54.579> in<00:02:54.909> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
I'm gonna thread on the beads in this

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.569 
I'm gonna thread on the beads in this
first<00:02:55.389> segment<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.099> we're<00:02:57.099> gonna<00:02:57.219> thread<00:02:57.489> on

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
first segment and we're gonna thread on

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.429 
first segment and we're gonna thread on
Daisy<00:02:57.849> spacers<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.599> between<00:02:58.629> so<00:02:59.169> I've<00:02:59.260> got<00:02:59.409> a

piece of Tiger Tail just insert that in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.280 
piece of Tiger Tail just insert that in
now<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.220> want<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.880> insert<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.450> so<00:04:32.660> it's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
now you want to insert it so it's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:46.790 
now you want to insert it so it's
actually<00:04:33.760> surpassing<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.850> few<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.240> beads

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.040 

so<00:04:47.310> I've<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.610> got<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.300> halfway<00:04:48.599> in

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
so I've actually got it like halfway in

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
that last ten millimeter pearl and then

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.390 
that last ten millimeter pearl and then
pulling<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.110> down<00:04:52.349> you<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:52.979> want<00:04:53.099> to<00:04:53.160> crimp

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
pulling it down you just want to crimp

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.029 
pulling it down you just want to crimp
that<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.849> nice<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.300> tight<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.830> that's

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
that really nice and tight so that's

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.409 
that really nice and tight so that's
going<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.250> be<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.520> center<00:04:56.819> of<00:04:56.879> our<00:04:57.000> necklace

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
going to be the center of our necklace

what we'll do now is just bend down that

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.080 
what we'll do now is just bend down that
way<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:04.080> they're<00:05:04.229> actually<00:05:04.530> gonna<00:05:04.650> go<00:05:05.159> like

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.730 

glass<00:05:21.890> pills<00:05:22.220> just<00:05:22.820> at<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.390> start<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.200> so

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
glass pills just at the start of it so

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.410 
glass pills just at the start of it so
we've<00:05:24.920> got<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.520> then<00:05:25.610> I'm<00:05:26.150> threatening

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
we've got that and then I'm threatening

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.210 
we've got that and then I'm threatening
on<00:05:26.600> a<00:05:26.630> crimp<00:05:26.900> from<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.650> be<00:05:27.770> spun<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:30.100> then<00:05:31.100> I'll

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
on a crimp from to be spun and then I'll

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:48.300 
on a crimp from to be spun and then I'll
do<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.520> same<00:05:31.550> for<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.030> other<00:05:32.210> side

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.430 

so<00:05:48.880> we've<00:05:49.030> got<00:05:49.270> percentile<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.200> then<00:05:50.320> we've

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
so we've got percentile and then we've

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.780 
so we've got percentile and then we've
got<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.770> true<00:05:51.040> class<00:05:51.220> pills

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
got the true class pills

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.870 
got the true class pills
extending<00:05:52.660> from<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.740> now<00:05:54.520> what<00:05:54.700> we're

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
extending from that and now what we're

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.490 
extending from that and now what we're
gonna<00:05:54.940> do<00:05:55.240> is<00:05:55.450> we're<00:05:55.660> going<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.840> crimp<00:05:56.139> up<00:05:56.320> a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
gonna do is we're going to crimp up a

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.250 
gonna do is we're going to crimp up a
tiny<00:05:56.889> bit<00:05:57.040> so<00:05:57.520> I'll<00:05:58.120> do<00:05:58.419> one<00:05:58.630> side<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.169> then

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
tiny bit so I'll do one side and then

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.900 
tiny bit so I'll do one side and then
we're<00:05:59.410> going<00:05:59.560> to<00:05:59.590> repeat<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.100> other<00:06:00.220> side<00:06:00.550> so

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
we're going to repeat the other side so

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.659 
we're going to repeat the other side so
I'm<00:06:01.030> in<00:06:01.180> crimping<00:06:01.630> up<00:06:04.320> leaving<00:06:05.320> a<00:06:05.410> gap<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.580> I'm

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
I'm in crimping up leaving a gap so I'm

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.240 
I'm in crimping up leaving a gap so I'm
going<00:06:06.850> to<00:06:06.880> get<00:06:07.060> there<00:06:07.350> I'll<00:06:08.350> creep<00:06:08.740> on<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.130> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
going to get there I'll creep on to the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.400 
going to get there I'll creep on to the
other<00:06:09.430> side<00:06:09.760> just<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.270> make<00:06:10.300> sure<00:06:10.750> that<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.139> is

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
other side just to make sure that it is

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:21.490 
other side just to make sure that it is
at<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.220> same<00:06:12.400> level

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.350 

and<00:06:21.590> then<00:06:22.310> what<00:06:22.580> we're<00:06:22.700> going<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:22.850> do<00:06:23.000> is<00:06:23.180> throw

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
and then what we're going to do is throw

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.450 
and then what we're going to do is throw
it<00:06:23.480> on<00:06:23.570> this<00:06:23.840> section<00:06:24.110> of<00:06:24.470> the<00:06:24.500> beans<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:25.160> the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
it on this section of the beans and the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.040 
it on this section of the beans and the
other<00:06:25.610> section<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.240> beach<00:06:26.420> and<00:06:26.690> crimp<00:06:26.930> on

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
other section of the beach and crimp on

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.280 
other section of the beach and crimp on
the<00:06:27.200> other<00:06:27.350> side<00:06:28.390> so<00:06:29.390> I<00:06:29.420> basically<00:06:29.960> just

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
the other side so I basically just

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.440 
the other side so I basically just
continue<00:06:31.010> to<00:06:31.130> thread<00:06:31.370> those<00:06:31.550> beads<00:06:31.940> on<00:06:32.180> and

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
continue to thread those beads on and

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.030 
continue to thread those beads on and
then<00:06:32.630> I<00:06:32.660> was<00:06:33.020> from<00:06:33.200> hitting<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.470> same<00:06:33.770> for<00:06:33.980> the

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
then I was from hitting the same for the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.750 
then I was from hitting the same for the
other<00:06:34.190> side

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
other side

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.360 
other side
so<00:06:34.940> it's<00:06:35.120> symmetrical<00:06:36.010> now<00:06:37.010> what<00:06:37.190> we're<00:06:37.310> gonna

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
so it's symmetrical now what we're gonna

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.310 
so it's symmetrical now what we're gonna
do<00:06:37.700> is<00:06:37.880> we're<00:06:38.090> just<00:06:38.120> going<00:06:38.390> to<00:06:38.450> finish<00:06:38.870> up<00:06:39.080> with

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
do is we're just going to finish up with

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.870 
do is we're just going to finish up with
this<00:06:39.500> last<00:06:39.770> section<00:06:40.070> which<00:06:40.370> is<00:06:40.550> actually

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
this last section which is actually

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.400 
this last section which is actually
going<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.090> attach<00:06:41.180> straight<00:06:41.750> on<00:06:41.900> to<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.110> clasp

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
going to attach straight on to the clasp

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.780 
going to attach straight on to the clasp
so<00:06:43.400> I'm<00:06:44.390> going<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:45.040> put<00:06:46.040> another<00:06:46.250> crimp

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
so I'm going to put another crimp

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.640 
so I'm going to put another crimp
so<00:06:46.970> thread<00:06:47.240> another<00:06:47.450> crimp<00:06:47.720> on<00:06:47.900> to<00:06:48.110> that<00:06:48.260> side

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
so thread another crimp on to that side

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.060 
so thread another crimp on to that side
of<00:06:48.830> the<00:06:48.920> tiger<00:06:49.130> tail<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:49.820> then<00:06:50.450> crimping

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
of the tiger tail and then crimping

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.760 
of the tiger tail and then crimping
allegory<00:06:52.070> about<00:06:52.660> that<00:06:53.660> far<00:06:53.990> up<00:06:54.200> so<00:06:54.500> that<00:06:54.650> would

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
allegory about that far up so that would

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.300 
allegory about that far up so that would
be<00:06:54.890> about<00:06:55.419> four<00:06:56.419> or<00:06:56.570> five<00:06:56.810> centimeters<00:06:57.500> up

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
be about four or five centimeters up

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.880 
be about four or five centimeters up
from<00:06:58.760> the<00:06:58.880> last<00:06:59.090> segment<00:06:59.390> I'll<00:07:00.380> do<00:07:00.590> the<00:07:00.710> same

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
from the last segment I'll do the same

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.100 
from the last segment I'll do the same
as<00:07:01.160> I<00:07:01.250> did<00:07:01.310> for<00:07:01.700> the<00:07:01.790> start<00:07:02.090> of<00:07:02.210> it<00:07:02.360> so<00:07:02.660> we'll

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
as I did for the start of it so we'll

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.600 
as I did for the start of it so we'll
bring<00:07:03.350> them<00:07:03.590> both<00:07:03.770> together

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
bring them both together

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.110 
bring them both together
and<00:07:05.890> then<00:07:06.890> make<00:07:07.100> sure<00:07:07.130> that<00:07:07.370> these<00:07:07.730> skis

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
and then make sure that these skis

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.270 
and then make sure that these skis
approximately<00:07:08.990> at<00:07:09.110> the<00:07:09.140> same<00:07:09.260> level<00:07:09.860> so<00:07:09.890> that

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
approximately at the same level so that

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.100 
approximately at the same level so that
our<00:07:10.460> necklace<00:07:11.090> is<00:07:11.240> going<00:07:11.360> to<00:07:11.480> be<00:07:11.630> so<00:07:11.810> much<00:07:11.930> for

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
our necklace is going to be so much for

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.670 
our necklace is going to be so much for
cut<00:07:12.320> the<00:07:12.440> end<00:07:12.590> and<00:07:13.460> then<00:07:14.450> I'm<00:07:14.870> gonna<00:07:15.260> thread<00:07:15.530> on

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
cut the end and then I'm gonna thread on

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.640 
cut the end and then I'm gonna thread on
this<00:07:15.830> section<00:07:16.340> of<00:07:16.580> the<00:07:16.990> so<00:07:17.990> we've<00:07:18.140> got<00:07:18.290> the<00:07:18.410> six

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
this section of the so we've got the six
