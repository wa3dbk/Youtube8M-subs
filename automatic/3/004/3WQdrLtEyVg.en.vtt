I'll clamp them together I like to glue
and<00:01:52.630> clamp<00:01:52.960> half<00:01:53.320> together<00:01:53.820> once<00:01:54.820> they're<00:01:55.090> dry

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
and clamp half together once they're dry

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.510 
and clamp half together once they're dry

together

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.580 

here's<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.670> beauty<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.300> once<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.410> all

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
here's the beauty of this once it's all

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.370 
here's the beauty of this once it's all
dry<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.520> scrap<00:02:37.850> cut<00:02:38.150> offs<00:02:38.330> simply<00:02:38.840> break<00:02:39.140> off

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
dry the scrap cut offs simply break off

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:55.720 
dry the scrap cut offs simply break off
with<00:02:39.860> no<00:02:40.310> damage<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> frame<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:54.520> little<00:02:55.520> bit

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
with no damage to the frame a little bit

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.640 
with no damage to the frame a little bit

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
of the papers left behind and can be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
of the papers left behind and can be
removed<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> block<00:02:58.610> plane<00:02:58.640> or<00:02:59.240> sandpaper

now<00:03:00.320> in<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.280> video<00:03:01.460> I<00:03:01.820> was<00:03:02.090> making<00:03:02.420> mitered

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
now in this video I was making mitered

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.750 
now in this video I was making mitered
cabinet<00:03:02.960> doors<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.160> concerned<00:03:04.550> that

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
cabinet doors and I was concerned that

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.820 
cabinet doors and I was concerned that
over<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.240> time<00:03:05.540> while<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.170> glued<00:03:06.500> miter

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
over in time while that glued miter

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.100 
over in time while that glued miter
might<00:03:07.130> come<00:03:07.400> apart<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.000> here's<00:03:08.780> what<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.020> did

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
might come apart so here's what I did

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.690 
might come apart so here's what I did
the<00:03:09.440> strengthen<00:03:10.010> it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.870 

I'm<00:03:15.700> adding<00:03:16.030> screws<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> corners<00:03:17.230> I'll

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
I'm adding screws to the corners I'll

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.860 
I'm adding screws to the corners I'll
countersink<00:03:18.880> with<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> three-eighths<00:03:19.570> inch

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
countersink with the three-eighths inch

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.200 
countersink with the three-eighths inch
and<00:03:20.170> then<00:03:20.740> pre-drill<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.670> an<00:03:21.790> eighth<00:03:21.940> inch

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.050 

you

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.759 

now<00:03:33.060> no<00:03:33.269> one<00:03:33.390> wants<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.689> see<00:03:33.930> those<00:03:34.110> ugly<00:03:34.439> screw

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
now no one wants to see those ugly screw

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.740 
now no one wants to see those ugly screw
head<00:03:34.950> oh<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.939> have<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.209> find<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.629> way<00:03:36.720> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
head oh and I have to find a way to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.380 
head oh and I have to find a way to
cover<00:03:37.079> them<00:03:37.319> up<00:03:37.409> yeah<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> could<00:03:38.760> use<00:03:38.939> a<00:03:39.000> dollar

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
cover them up yeah I could use a dollar

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.869 
cover them up yeah I could use a dollar
rod<00:03:39.689> but<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.470> would<00:03:40.680> really<00:03:41.010> show<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.670> end

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
rod but that would really show the end

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.250 
rod but that would really show the end
grain<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> better<00:03:43.560> way<00:03:44.720> I'll<00:03:45.720> use<00:03:46.230> a

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
grain so I have a better way I'll use a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.160 
grain so I have a better way I'll use a
3/8<00:03:46.890> inch<00:03:47.040> plug<00:03:47.610> cutter<00:03:47.879> and<00:03:48.209> make<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:48.989> on

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
3/8 inch plug cutter and make them on
