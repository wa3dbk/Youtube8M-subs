00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
what's the e B's either oh wow yeah so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.219 
what's the e B's either oh wow yeah so
each<00:01:41.729> mutant<00:01:42.180> will<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.920> specific<00:01:45.229> why's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
each mutant will have specific why's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
each mutant will have specific why's
that<00:01:46.259> he<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.189> okay

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that he doesn't have okay

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.550 
that he doesn't have okay
guess<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.659> too<00:01:48.810> young<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.110> something<00:01:49.439> yeah

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
guess it's too young or something yeah

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.840 
guess it's too young or something yeah
but<00:01:49.740> each<00:01:49.860> mutants<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.369> supposed<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> have

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but each mutants are supposed to have

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
but each mutants are supposed to have
specific<00:01:51.680> buffers<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:53.399> their<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:55.170> their<00:01:55.500> moves

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
specific buffers on their of their moves

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.850 
specific buffers on their of their moves
and<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.549> guess<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.939> numbers<00:01:57.329> mean<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.140> how

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and I guess the numbers mean like how

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
and I guess the numbers mean like how
well<00:01:59.100> they're<00:01:59.280> gonna<00:01:59.399> work<00:01:59.640> anyways<00:02:00.090> let's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
well they're gonna work anyways let's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.999 
well they're gonna work anyways let's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
amazing and now it's like you have to

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.469 
amazing and now it's like you have to
actually<00:05:44.789> think<00:05:44.910> when<00:05:45.120> you're<00:05:45.240> in<00:05:45.270> battle

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
actually think when you're in battle

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.240 
actually think when you're in battle
it's<00:05:45.810> kind<00:05:46.020> of<00:05:46.050> like<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.289> Avengers<00:05:46.590> 1<00:05:46.919> look<00:05:47.160> at

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
it's kind of like the Avengers 1 look at

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.060 
it's kind of like the Avengers 1 look at
his<00:05:47.660> defense<00:05:48.660> goes<00:05:48.810> all<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.080> way<00:05:49.229> up<00:05:49.470> and<00:05:49.680> I

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
his defense goes all the way up and I

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.529 
his defense goes all the way up and I
like<00:05:50.280> how<00:05:50.460> they<00:05:50.640> differentiate<00:05:51.030> the

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
like how they differentiate the

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.500 
like how they differentiate the
statistics<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.500> those<00:05:53.130> buffers<00:05:53.610> from<00:05:54.300> each

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
statistics of those buffers from each

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.250 
statistics of those buffers from each
species<00:05:54.930> because<00:05:55.890> realistically<00:05:57.110> some<00:05:58.110> guy

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
species because realistically some guy

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.469 
species because realistically some guy
like<00:05:58.440> Trojan<00:05:58.890> would<00:05:59.010> have<00:05:59.250> more<00:05:59.789> defense<00:06:00.360> than

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
like Trojan would have more defense than

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.630 
like Trojan would have more defense than
say<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.840> Cerberus<00:06:01.380> or<00:06:01.530> something<00:06:01.919> just

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
say a Cerberus or something just

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.020 
say a Cerberus or something just
