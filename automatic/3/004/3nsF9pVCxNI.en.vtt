00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
gonna be an experimental psychologist

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.810 
gonna be an experimental psychologist
never<00:02:41.230> dreamed<00:02:41.530> I'd<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:41.710> end<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.070> reforming

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
slaughter plants but it used the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.440 
slaughter plants but it used the
knowledge<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.610> learned<00:02:45.820> about<00:02:45.910> optical

illusions<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.080> my<00:02:47.380> work<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.770> cat<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.580> know

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
illusions in my work with cat you know

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670

what are the cattle seeing nobody

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.380 
what are the cattle seeing nobody
thought<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.980> look<00:02:51.160> at<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.430> before<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:52.000> family

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
thought to look at that before I family

dark<00:02:56.380> there's<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.040> code<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.610> fence<00:02:57.850> visual

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
dark there's a code on the fence visual

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.750 
dark there's a code on the fence visual
things<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.020> most<00:02:59.140> people<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.530> notice<00:02:59.800> now

I'm a visual thinker now when i was here

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.140 
I'm a visual thinker now when i was here
at<00:03:02.770> Franklin<00:03:03.160> Pierce<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.550> didn't<00:03:03.850> know<00:03:03.880> that

other they need to work together let's
take<00:03:17.560> something<00:03:17.830> like<00:03:17.890> Japanese<00:03:18.459> nuclear

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
take something like Japanese nuclear

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.240

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
power plant as a visual thinker there's

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.800 
power plant as a visual thinker there's
no<00:03:21.430> way<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.670> would<00:03:21.940> have<00:03:21.970> put<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.360> emergency

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
no way I would have put the emergency

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.600 
no way I would have put the emergency
generators<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> basement<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> live

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
generators in the basement and you live

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.170 
generators in the basement and you live
next<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.060> sea<00:03:25.440> because<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.940> guess<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
next to the sea because I guess see the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.660 
next to the sea because I guess see the
waters<00:03:28.510> only<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.930> there<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.980> I've<00:03:30.280> done<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.520> lot

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
waters only in there and I've done a lot

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.160 
waters only in there and I've done a lot
of<00:03:30.730> work<00:03:30.820> with<00:03:31.090> industrial<00:03:31.660> equipment<00:03:32.080> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
of work with industrial equipment and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.960 
of work with industrial equipment and
diesels<00:03:32.530> don't<00:03:32.680> work<00:03:32.950> underwater<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.700> just

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
diesels don't work underwater it's just

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.650 
diesels don't work underwater it's just
that<00:03:34.150> simple<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.850> what<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.090> was<00:03:37.270> young<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.630> used

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that simple and what I was young I used

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.540 
that simple and what I was young I used
to<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.110> was<00:03:38.200> due<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.500> stupidity<00:03:38.920> you

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
to think that was due to stupidity you

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.520 
to think that was due to stupidity you
know<00:03:39.670> what<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:40.360> they<00:03:40.600> don't<00:03:40.900> see<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
know what I think it's they don't see it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.650 
know what I think it's they don't see it
the<00:03:42.130> math<00:03:42.340> petitions<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.030> design<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.450> reactor

the math petitions that design a reactor

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.570 
the math petitions that design a reactor
don't<00:03:44.140> see<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.040> know<00:03:45.070> water<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.520> the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
don't see that you know water in the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.490 
don't see that you know water in the
basement<00:03:45.760> might<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.390> really<00:03:47.080> really<00:03:47.200> bad

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500

making policy about I think this is

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.870 
making policy about I think this is
