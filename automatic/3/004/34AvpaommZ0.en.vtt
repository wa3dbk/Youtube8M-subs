00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
some other things first of all the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.679 
some other things first of all the
handle<00:01:59.280> here<00:02:00.280> behind<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.909> wrapping<00:02:01.329> is

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
handle here behind the wrapping is

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.380 
handle here behind the wrapping is
actually<00:02:02.500> pretty<00:02:02.740> sharp<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.460> corners<00:02:03.880> here

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
actually pretty sharp the corners here

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990 
actually pretty sharp the corners here
are<00:02:04.659> pretty<00:02:04.840> sharp<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.530> that's<00:02:06.490> one<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
are pretty sharp and that's one of the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.889 
are pretty sharp and that's one of the
reasons<00:02:07.390> I've<00:02:07.539> wrapped<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.990> with<00:02:08.020> paracord

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
reasons I've wrapped it with paracord

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.100 
reasons I've wrapped it with paracord
to<00:02:10.899> make<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.290> comfortable<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> hold<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
to make it more comfortable to hold but

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.580 
to make it more comfortable to hold but
another<00:02:14.380> thing<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.150> feet<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.170> retention

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
another thing is the feet the retention

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.550 
another thing is the feet the retention
of<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> knife<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:19.630> secure<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
of the knife it's not as secure as I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.480 
of the knife it's not as secure as I
