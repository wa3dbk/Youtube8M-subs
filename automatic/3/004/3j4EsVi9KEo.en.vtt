00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
for me I decide to this university

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280 
for me I decide to this university
because<00:01:53.380> Suri<00:01:54.580> engineering<00:01:55.580> course<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.930> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
because Suri engineering course is the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.070 
because Suri engineering course is the
top<00:01:57.530> story<00:01:57.830> in<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.160> UK<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.880> for<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.690> research

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
top story in the UK and for the research

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.200 
top story in the UK and for the research
about<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.619> communication<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.550> best<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.119> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
about the communication is best in the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.719 
about the communication is best in the
Europe<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:03.380> why<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.920> chose<00:02:04.280> Suri

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
Europe so that's why I chose Suri

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.749 
Europe so that's why I chose Suri
I<00:02:07.810> choose<00:02:08.810> UK<00:02:09.290> because<00:02:09.739> my<00:02:10.040> second<00:02:10.429> language

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
I choose UK because my second language

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.320 
I choose UK because my second language
is<00:02:10.910> English<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.489> too<00:02:13.850> much<00:02:13.880> place

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
is English so it's not too much place

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.220 
is English so it's not too much place
and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.739> can<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.360> good<00:02:17.360> education<00:02:17.510> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and then you can have good education and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.460 
and then you can have good education and
also<00:02:19.070> for<00:02:19.360> engineering<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.200> good

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
also for engineering there have good

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.400 
also for engineering there have good
