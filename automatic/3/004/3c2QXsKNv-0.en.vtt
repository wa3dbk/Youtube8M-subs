because<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
because in this game it's all really

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
because in this game it's all really
about<00:01:12.780> lying<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.350> trying<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.710> trick<00:01:13.920> people

about lying and trying to trick people

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
about lying and trying to trick people
into<00:01:14.430> thinking<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:14.970> innocent<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
into thinking that you're innocent so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
into thinking that you're innocent so
even<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.320> someone<00:01:16.530> says<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:16.979> innocent

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
even if someone says they're innocent

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
even if someone says they're innocent
they<00:01:17.520> could<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.850> lying<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.750> you're

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
they could be lying now when you're

they could be lying now when you're
playing<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.229> model<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.680> probably

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
playing this model it is probably

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.260 
playing this model it is probably
recommended<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> mic

recommended for you to have a mic

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.870 
recommended for you to have a mic
because<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> lot<00:01:22.740> easier<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.430> talk

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because it's just a lot easier to talk

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
people will automatically assume that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
them so try and get as far away as

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.620 
them so try and get as far away as
possible<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.000> other<00:03:17.180> thing<00:03:17.419> that<00:03:17.450> you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
possible now the other thing that you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.720

can play as is the detective and this is
quite<00:03:20.030> an<00:03:20.180> interesting<00:03:20.239> class<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
quite an interesting class because you

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.620 
quite an interesting class because you

innocent<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.560> detective<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.190> never<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
innocent and a detective can never be a

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.150 
innocent and a detective can never be a
traitor<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.090> what<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.870> need<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.139> do<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.530> you'll

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
traitor so what you need to do is you'll

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.379 
traitor so what you need to do is you'll
find<00:03:28.430> people<00:03:28.609> that<00:03:28.760> will<00:03:28.940> follow<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.299> around

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389

and<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:29.870> may<00:03:30.049> be<00:03:30.109> because<00:03:30.440> they're<00:03:31.099> innocent

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
and this may be because they're innocent

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.339 
and this may be because they're innocent
and<00:03:31.549> they<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.209> like<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.629> hundred<00:03:33.079> percent

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
and they know and like a hundred percent

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.360 
and they know and like a hundred percent
sure<00:03:33.379> that<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.829> are<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.160> well

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
or they could be a traitor just waiting

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.050 
or they could be a traitor just waiting
to<00:03:36.109> catch<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.319> off<00:03:36.470> guard<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.010> as<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.459> detective

to catch you off guard so as a detective
it's<00:03:38.209> quite<00:03:38.510> risky<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.139> you<00:03:39.200> need<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.470> watch

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
it's quite risky and you need to watch

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.319 
it's quite risky and you need to watch
out<00:03:39.859> because<00:03:39.889> all<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.790> traders<00:03:41.060> will<00:03:41.239> be

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
out because all the traders will be

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.300 
out because all the traders will be
after<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.780> because<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.470> DNA<00:03:42.889> scanner

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
after you because you have a DNA scanner

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.520 
after you because you have a DNA scanner
which<00:03:43.519> will<00:03:43.699> allow<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.510> pretty<00:03:45.169> much<00:03:45.290> go

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
which will allow you to pretty much go

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.619 
which will allow you to pretty much go
up<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.829> body<00:03:46.069> find<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.639> DNA<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.269> follow

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
up to a body find the DNA and follow

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.050 
up to a body find the DNA and follow
whoever<00:03:47.870> killed<00:03:48.290> them<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.040> yeah<00:03:49.849> definitely

whoever killed them so yeah definitely
watch<00:03:50.510> out<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.959> try<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.470> stay<00:03:51.709> with<00:03:51.889> more

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
watch out and try and stay with more

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.860 
watch out and try and stay with more
than<00:03:52.220> two<00:03:52.370> people<00:03:52.639> but<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.449> case<00:03:53.690> they

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
can take control of certain objects and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.220 
can take control of certain objects and
so<00:04:04.940> for<00:04:05.120> example<00:04:05.449> you<00:04:05.510> can<00:04:05.599> become<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.870> barrel

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
so for example you can become a barrel

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.720 
so for example you can become a barrel
and<00:04:06.410> just<00:04:06.440> float<00:04:06.739> around<00:04:06.889> which<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.430> really

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
and just float around which is really

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.210 
and just float around which is really
funny<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.540> see<00:04:08.750> how<00:04:09.290> other<00:04:09.560> people<00:04:09.650> react

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
funny and to see how other people react

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.890 
funny and to see how other people react
to<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.519> fact<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:10.849> like<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> chair<00:04:11.449> might<00:04:11.720> be

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
to the fact that like a chair might be

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.470 
to the fact that like a chair might be
moving<00:04:12.109> or<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.470> desk<00:04:12.799> or<00:04:13.129> just<00:04:13.760> something<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
moving or a desk or just something that

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.599 
moving or a desk or just something that
isn't<00:04:14.870> obviously<00:04:15.590> meant<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.889> be<00:04:16.130> moving<00:04:16.489> is

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
isn't obviously meant to be moving is

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.069 
isn't obviously meant to be moving is
just<00:04:16.820> flying<00:04:17.030> around<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.419> map<00:04:17.599> just<00:04:17.630> doing

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
just flying around the map just doing

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.990 
just flying around the map just doing
weird<00:04:18.440> crap<00:04:18.769> now<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.250> just<00:04:19.340> want<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.639> finish<00:04:19.729> off

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
weird crap now I just want to finish off

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.699 
weird crap now I just want to finish off
by<00:04:20.180> saying<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.780> definitely<00:04:21.380> one<00:04:21.680> of
