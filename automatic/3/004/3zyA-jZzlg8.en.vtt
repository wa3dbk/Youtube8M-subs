00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.860
 hello everyone welcome to easy cooking 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.619
 my name is andy and today we are going 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.600
 to prepare a rich bread the easy stopper 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.820
 to make is delicious and we need 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.040
 very few and by comparison 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.700
 it's roughly 10 minutes and time 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.349
 of cooking is between 25 and 30 minutes 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.770
 I hope this recipe is degrees in 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.770
 little ones 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.060
 the ingredients for this recipe are me 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.310
 I'm using a mold that already comes with 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.320
 the pasta included for pay but if 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.780
 you want to make your own pasta or 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.090
 mass will need one and a half cup of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.650
 ground grant cookies if they do not find 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.360
 this type of cookies can use 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.790
 any other type of cracker that is 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.730
 of cinnamon flavor or if they live in Mexico 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.470
 they can also use cookies marias 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.680
 they will also need a third cup of 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.480
 butter without melted salt and a mold 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.820
 round for 9-inch pay 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.460
 for the filling we need 4 yolks of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.310
 egg a can of 14 ounces of milk 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 sweet condensed half cup of juice 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.650
 green lemon and the zest of a lemon 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.409
 green for the meringue we need 4 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.150
 egg whites half a cup of sugar and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.420
 a quarter teaspoon of cream 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.630
 tartar let's start preheat the oven to 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.000
 350 degrees fahrenheit or 180 degrees 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.740
 centigrade as I already told you I'm 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 using a mold already prepared with the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.570
 pasta but to prepare your own pasta 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.610
 in a bowl mix one and a half cups of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.950
 ground cookies can use cookies 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 marias or cinnamon cookies we're going to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 mix the already ground cookies with a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.259
 1/3 cup of melted butter 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.720
 mix well until both 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.729
 ingredients are well incorporated and 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
 empty in this mixture on a mold for 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.660
 pay cover the background and everything 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.640
 around the mold with the cookies 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.850
 ground and bake in an oven 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.550
 preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit oa 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 180 degrees centigrade by 8 or 10 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.020
 minutes or until the cookies take 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.240
 a golden color to make the filling 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.319
 I'm going to use my electric mixer but 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.849
 if you prefer, you can 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 Mix everything with the help of a fork 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.680
 at low speed I'm going to mix the milk 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.659
 condensed and the egg yolks I'm going to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 add one yolk at a time beating 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.299
 15 seconds before adding the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.299
 next bud 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.510
 after the yolks add the zest 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.850
 of lemon and lemon juice and mix to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.710
 medium high speed for 30 seconds more 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.830
 or until all the ingredients are 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.200
 well incorporated empty this mix 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.050
 about your mold for pay 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.110
 and bakes again at 350 degrees 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.239
 fahrenheit or 180 degrees centigrade by 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.030
 15 minutes or until filling is 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.900
 firm reserve for a moment so that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.900
 cool a little 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.050
 in an electric mixer add the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.350
 egg whites and a quarter of 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.050
 teaspoon cream of tartar mix 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.210
 high speed for 4 or 5 minutes or until 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.020
 that the whites get thick and 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.020
 fluffy 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.060
 as they are ready add slowly the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.700
 sugar 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.500
 and continues beating at high speed by 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.830
 one more minute or until the meringue 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.900
 be firm 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.390
 the sugar will give a little bit of shine to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.230
 our meringue so it will be firm and 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.230
 glossy 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.420
 since the meringue is ready covers the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.540
 pay with the meringue can add so much 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860
 or as little as you like the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.569
 Meringue usually does not go 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.800
 completely smooth so I do not know 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.620
 Strive to want to leave 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.480
 completely flat on the contrary between 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.060
 more misaligned is prettier you will see 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.090
 let's bake again at 350 degrees 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.760
 fahrenheit or 180 degrees centigrade by 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.900
 10 or 15 minutes or until the meringue 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.900
 have a golden color 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.590
 and that's it, let it cool down before 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.590
 to serve 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.950
