00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello to all I find today 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.780
 for a new leader 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.250
 we will decorate together how 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.420
 to make little darlings very 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.990
 quickly and easily 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990
 Let's go 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.379
 at the hardware level we need everything 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.149
 just a piece of cloth 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.820
 a glue gun but if you do not 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.850
 no you can do a sewing so 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.430
 with a thread and a needle we need 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.430
 elastic and a pair of scissors 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.920
 I cut a rectangle of fabric 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.180
 about 15 cm by 30 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.540
 I take a piece of rubber that I 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.090
 chopped off 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.390
 about three quarters of the molding of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390
 my fabric 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.259
 I take in cloth coupons that I 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.570
 fold in half and I'm going to stick 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.840
 simply on the length so if 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.300
 you do not have a glue gun or 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.710
 from glue to textile simply you 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.710
 have to sew 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 now that I stuck on all the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 length I can return my fabric 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.840
 I take my elastic that I place at 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.550
 inside of my fabric and I 'm doing 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.550
 come out on the other side 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 1 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.360
 me 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.850
 I have a piece of elastic from each 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.850
 right side and recovers and I close 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.890
 the top 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.939
 I'll make little things for them 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.129
 I do not know if we can call it 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.849
 like that but I will show my fabric 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.950
 inside like this and I'm going 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.950
 fix with glue 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:11.569
 so here I bend inside as 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:16.220
 this now that I realized my 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.590
 little tour I'm going to come to place a 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.739
 little bit of glue at this level as 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:28.780
 this so that you can enter this 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.780
 part in the other and close everything 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.440
 so the device if you do not have any 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.440
 glue we'll do a little seam 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.190
 and so that's the result our little 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.170
 darling is now over it was 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.310
 really very simple and very fast well 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.290
 heard you can do 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.120
 the smallest of the biggest with 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.400
 other materials and other colors 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540
