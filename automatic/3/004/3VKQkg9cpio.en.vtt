00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:03.628
I estimate us to be
about three hours
behind schedule.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.140
I told Mr. Emmett
to run at flank speed
and hold off a trim dive...

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:10.144
until we make up
the lost time.
That's fine, Lieutenant.

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:15.181
You're a first-rate X.O.,
Andy.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.185
A damn good submariner.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.852
I know the men like you.

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:24.927
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:29.260
I know you would.
I'm not questioning
your bravery.

00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:31.765
The question is:
What about their lives?

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.105
You and Mr. Emmett
are good friends.

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:40.301
You went to the Academy together.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.402
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:46.505
&lt;i&gt;Or what about&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;some of the younger&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;enlisted men?&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:49.949
You know,
a lot of those guys look up
to you like a big brother.

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:52.112
You willing to lay
their lives on the line?

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.192
You see?
You hesitate.

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:01.627
But as a captain, you can't.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:03.790
You have to act.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.892
If you don't, you put
the entire crew at risk.

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:11.531
&lt;i&gt;Now that's the job.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's not a science.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:16.408
&lt;i&gt;You have to be able to make&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;hard decisions, based on&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;imperfect information.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:20.278
&lt;i&gt;Asking men to carry out orders&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that may result in their deaths.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:25.878
&lt;i&gt;And if you're wrong,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you suffer the consequences.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:29.482
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions...

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:34.656
without pause,
without reflection,

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:37.825
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:47.008
&lt;i&gt;Tell Mr. Hirsch&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'd like a word with him,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;would you?&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.980
Aye, sir.
