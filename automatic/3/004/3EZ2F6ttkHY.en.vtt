00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.670
 Newly released from Storm 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:14.480
 I would like to introduce you to Fireside 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:19.430
 First of all, the layout has 5 inches of kp from the pin . 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.230
 In target schools left Masu at the Inn after we made a performance Weiss because is 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.949
 Blanc Soul Hm 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.090
 It is a place where the bar line from the grip center intersected 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:34.440
 This time the fire side which is maintaining balance is 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 Fire load of the previous work a little cover stock has changed 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:45.659
 r 2 x-Pearl is changing to Earls 's hybrid 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:51.089
 The cover speed itself is the same cover stock as the popular high road . 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:54.430
 It is a predecessor of the fire roll the surface of the material is fried three skewers 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:01:01.000
 Being strong to Oyu and becoming a hybrid 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:05.920
 A score that is very easy to handle without extra backend movement 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.180
 Thunder because it is a sanding balls have become in Thunder line Sabisa 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 Even if you liked the line, you can use it in oily positions . 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 Very much because 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.530
