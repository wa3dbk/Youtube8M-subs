00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 first of all my deepest condolences 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.640
 for all those people who gave for more 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.450
 of 10 years of the guns manga and it was had 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.860
 that eat this horrible horrible ending 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 there were a lot of questions 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420
 solve and was very pulled the hairs 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 show later is also walking the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.580
 same place since they resorted to some 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 little things that were thrown in the anime but 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 And that is another matter. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.710
 so let's go back to what is kagaku in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.710
 that thing was left 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.380
 another thing that surprised me is that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.810
 several chapters there has been nothing of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.810
 stuffing and that's worthy to celebrate 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's amazing how a person can 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 take so much affection for a character that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 comes from a franchise with more than 4 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 years and beyond the dense and the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.790
 moral discourses of the character nobody 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.850
 it takes away all the deeds that he has done 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.850
 so far I know I mean the big one at 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.850
 unique and unparalleled tom tom 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.490
 thomas thomas 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.180
 you know there is something quite curious and very 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 funny about all this and that is 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.230
 they can quietly leave the series 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.540
 to begin to see volume 4 of everything 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.640
 may are index that part of chapter 10 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.310
 everything we saw is exactly what 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.750
 today in huaycán not necessarily in this 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.280
 series have to eat the first 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.260
 chapters to see this arch can 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.210
 from Chapter 10 without missing 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.220
 nothing but if you want some little details 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.040
 more about what happened exactly with the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 satellite of the diagram obligatorily 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.890
 are going to have to see the first 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.870
 chapters 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.520
 now they remember all the things that I 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.530
 I told him in the chapter review 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 earlier well while I was dry I was 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 having an incredible fight with the mend 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.450
 although she did not know anything but 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.220
 quietly the scientists were 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.380
 moving to other facilities to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.940
 continue with all projects and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.009
 clear as I did not know anything while 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.810
 having a talk his under and with tomás 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.810
 is going to run into another and motorcycle 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.720
 if you look carefully series always 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.909
 He insisted on letting the character take me out 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.619
 as a normal lack but let's see 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.820
 a facet of it never seen in the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.620
 next chapters 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.050
 on the other hand takes going to take the paper 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 very important in this spin-off and it's 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.010
 pretty funny without the intention of doing 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.080
 spoiler but it's very funny that it takes 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 I ended up having a pretty protagonist 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.870
 important in this series being that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.790
 supposes that the series of my here does not 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.200
 there is a curiosity in this chapter that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.000
 there is a new agent where he sings 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.560
 this misawa girl in the lady who did the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.680
 Aretha's voice in the film of your scent 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780

 thousand subscribers the truth that many

 thanks for following me I did not expect this 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.319
 and the truth that gave an opinion a 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.599
 little bit different from what really
