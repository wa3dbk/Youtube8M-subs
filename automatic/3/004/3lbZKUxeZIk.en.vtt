00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.190 
literally blew all my money on skate
equipment<00:01:31.479> skates<00:01:32.409> wheels<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.730> works<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.330> was

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
equipment skates wheels the works I was

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.140 
equipment skates wheels the works I was
left<00:01:35.380> with<00:01:35.560> no<00:01:35.770> money<00:01:35.800> for<00:01:36.280> padding<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.940> that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.700 
left with no money for padding and that
was<00:01:37.270> essentially<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.840> last<00:01:38.290> thing<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:38.680> my

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
was essentially the last thing on my

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.180 
was essentially the last thing on my
list<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.159> buy<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.690> how<00:01:41.170> exactly<00:01:41.320> did<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.920> manage

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
list to buy so how exactly did I manage

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.570 
list to buy so how exactly did I manage
all<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:42.790> time<00:01:43.000> without<00:01:43.330> them<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:44.140> might<00:01:44.320> ask

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
all this time without them you might ask

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.860 
all this time without them you might ask
well<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.610> knew<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.180> only<00:01:46.300> way<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> get

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
well I knew that the only way to get

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.640 
well I knew that the only way to get
better<00:01:47.080> was<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.710> course<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.880> start<00:01:49.120> out<00:01:49.240> slow

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
better was of course to start out slow

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.899 
better was of course to start out slow
sometimes<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.070> need<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> confidence

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
sometimes you just need the confidence

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.360 
sometimes you just need the confidence
to<00:01:52.420> do<00:01:52.570> things<00:01:52.810> slow<00:01:53.170> at<00:01:53.290> first<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.830> then<00:01:54.130> ramp

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
to do things slow at first and then ramp

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.410 
to do things slow at first and then ramp
up<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> intervals<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.470> did<00:01:56.650> just<00:01:56.860> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
up the intervals and I did just that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.899 
up the intervals and I did just that
starting<00:01:58.420> slow<00:01:58.720> was<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.320> key<00:01:59.620> because<00:02:00.370> I<00:02:00.580> didn't

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
starting slow was a key because I didn't

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.450 
starting slow was a key because I didn't
have<00:02:01.060> any<00:02:01.210> padding<00:02:01.540> on<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.080> knew<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:02.979> had<00:02:03.310> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
skating form for most but I felt it was

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.030 
skating form for most but I felt it was
rather<00:02:13.030> important<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.900> train<00:02:14.200> my<00:02:14.349> senses<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
rather important to train my senses and
