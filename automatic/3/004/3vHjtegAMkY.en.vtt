00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 welcome to this life exhibition my 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 name is francisco javier and the day of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.600
 Today I will talk about the concepts 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.600
 basic file systems 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.380
 in this video we will attend the following 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.910
 topics as you can see my goal is 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.770
 treat the fundamental issues that one 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.550
 must know to understand what is this 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 file systems 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.260
 let's start with the definition of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.120
 file system system 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 files is an algorithm that structure 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.810
 the information stored in memory and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 allows the operating system management 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.570
 storage space and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 efficient data and information access 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 imagine this algorithm as a person 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 that organizes folders and documents in a 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 office archivist the way in which 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.470
 these people organize that information 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.150
 it can be very varied in the same way that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.000
 There are several types of system 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.250
 files for efficient management of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.329
 information the operating system defines 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.329
 a file unit 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.739
 the formal definition of file is 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.199
 set of bits stored in a 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.150
 device however extract the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.979
 present exhibition we will define a 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.630
 file as a set of information 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.909
 contained in memory and that is 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.470
 identified by a name to the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.540
 computer files are called 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.520
 because they are the digital equivalents of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.560
 the documents written in an office 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.409
 traditional internet browsers 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.759
 the word processor even the 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.470
 software with which this was made 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.080
 exhibition are made up of 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.399
 files without these the management and of 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 storage would not be 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.670
 possible 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.210
 the operating system organizes two 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.490
 files in directory structures 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.760
 the name of the file and its path 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.960
 directory define it univocally 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.600
 there are two ways of representing 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.760
 absolute address directories which 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.170
 describes all the way from the root of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.780
 directory to the location of the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.190
 file in the relative direction which 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.400
 only describes the current directory 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.050
 without referring the path by default the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.060
 Windows file explorer look 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.310
 shows the relative directory of the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.960
 folder in which you are but 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.060
 it can also be configured to show 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.560
 absolute directory the system 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 directories makes it easier for the user to 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.640
 organization of your files 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.200
 now we will talk about the partitions 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.660
 a partition in named volume is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 a space logically divided in the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.050
 hard drive on which they are staying and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.270
 organize the archives through a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.980
 file system each partition is 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.440
 treated by the operating system as a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
 independent disk a hard drive 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
 standard can support a maximum of 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 four primary partitions or three 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.750
 primary partitions and an extended the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 use of multiple partitions in the same 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.310
 disk allows for example install 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.989
 several operating systems in one 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.630
 hard disk all separated into 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.489
 partitions also allows a better 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.769
 organization of the archives and greater 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.810
 data protection since if a 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.120
 partition is damaged the others will continue 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.739
 operating normally , hence 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.989
 used to create a partition for the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.090
 operating system and another for the rest 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.459
 of the windows user files are 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.850
 Den by default creates two partitions in 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.850
 the disc 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.360
 finally I will talk about the structure 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.980
 internal hard disk parts 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.799
 main components are the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.150
 following the dishes are each of 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.099
 the magnetizing disks that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.250
 they find inside the hard drive in 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.810
 they are read write the information the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.060
 head is the set of arms 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.980
 parallel to the plates at the tip of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.379
 each one of those arms is the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.629
 read and write heads so 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.870
 there is so much a head for each surface 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.239
 of the disk a head is the most 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.890
 near the arm to the hard drive and it's the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.440
 who writes you information in the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.239
 surface of the dishes the distance 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.220
 between a head and the surface of the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.220
 disk is only three nanometers 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.480
 also the different areas of the disc 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.329
 hard they also get proper names a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.950
 face is one side of a plate naturally 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.260
 each dish has two sides 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.420
 a track is called 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.060
 circumference within a face like 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.310
 it could be observed from the paragraph 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.870
 a cylinder is a set of tracks 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 whose circles are aligned 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.670
 vertically 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.500
 the disk sectors are each 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.690
 the wedge- shaped parts that divide 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.870
 one- sided with can be seen in the subsection 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.030
 b a track sector the line be 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.699
 intersection between a track and a sector 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.080
 they are minimum storage units 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.630
 which can be claimed to register on disk 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.990
 hard does not have a fixed size although the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.729
 current standard are 512 bytes without 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.000
 However, work is being done to increase 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.760
 that standard to 4 kilobytes 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.560
 finally a cluster is a set of 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.990
 sectors of tracks as you can see in 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.330
 the paragraph of depending on the scheme of 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.390
 used format these clusters can be 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.020
 from two to entry and 32 former sectors of 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.430
 track 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.139
 this is the minimum unit of 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.819
 storage on which hard drive 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.940
 can perform read operations and 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.940
 writing 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.520
 and so we have reached the end of this 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.500
 video we have seen the basics 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.270
 about file systems since 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.730
 precisely a file system 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.930
 up the structure to the hard drive if 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.910
 they want to go deeper into 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.650
 details the file systems les 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.940
 I recommend consulting online I'm 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.670
 looking for videos about it 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.020
 youtube a lot of material available 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.020
 thank you for your attention and see you
