offers most of the stuff and the only

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.350 
offers most of the stuff and the only
difference<00:02:49.920> after<00:02:50.920> looking<00:02:51.430> at<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.120> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
difference after looking at this is that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.140 
difference after looking at this is that
with<00:02:53.080> unity<00:02:53.320> free<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.980> unity<00:02:54.310> Pro<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.910> only

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
with unity free and unity Pro the only

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.380 
with unity free and unity Pro the only
thing<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:56.340> every<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:57.700> some<00:02:57.940> completely

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
thing that every that's some completely

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.750 
thing that every that's some completely
different<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:59.489> that<00:03:00.489> um<00:03:01.739> all<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:03.010> offers<00:03:03.400> is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
different is that um all it offers is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.640 
different is that um all it offers is
some<00:03:04.060> excuse<00:03:04.540> me<00:03:04.720> I'm<00:03:04.959> like<00:03:05.140> thinking<00:03:05.470> right

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
some excuse me I'm like thinking right

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.000 
some excuse me I'm like thinking right
now<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:07.959> extra<00:03:08.440> like<00:03:08.680> shady

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
now is it's just extra like shady

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.710 
now is it's just extra like shady
effects<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.910> make<00:03:10.030> your<00:03:10.209> characters<00:03:10.630> look

better or something it makes it look

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.009 
better or something it makes it look

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.600 
really doing a tutorial on this on how
to<00:06:32.210> use<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.660> actually<00:06:32.840> to<00:06:33.169> be<00:06:33.260> honest<00:06:33.710> because

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
to use it actually to be honest because

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.810 
to use it actually to be honest because
the<00:06:34.760> problem<00:06:35.210> is<00:06:35.360> is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
the problem is is

the problem is is
I'm<00:06:36.060> learning<00:06:36.570> unity<00:06:36.930> myself<00:06:37.440> so<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:38.040> just

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
I'm learning unity myself so I just
