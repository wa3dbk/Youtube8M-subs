they are called the sulfur mayfly hatch
size<00:01:31.030> 14<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:33.789> use<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:33.940> pheasant<00:01:34.330> tail<00:01:34.450> and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
size 14 so if we use a pheasant tail and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.969 
size 14 so if we use a pheasant tail and
carpet<00:01:34.840> John<00:01:34.960> today<00:01:35.140> we're<00:01:35.350> trying<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.679> tape

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.080 
pheasant tails in copper John size 1416
will<00:01:41.649> imitate<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.340> guy<00:01:42.610> right<00:01:43.030> there

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.480 

this<00:01:46.090> guy<00:01:46.330> has<00:01:46.539> external<00:01:47.170> gills<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.159> he<00:01:48.340> is

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
this guy has external gills so he is

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.389 
this guy has external gills so he is
breathing<00:01:48.909> off<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.420> water<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.710> oxygen<00:01:51.310> that

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
breathing off the water and oxygen that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.920 
breathing off the water and oxygen that
is<00:01:51.640> supplied<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.270> algae<00:01:52.659> that<00:01:52.780> he's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
is supplied in that algae that he's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.539 
is supplied in that algae that he's
sitting<00:01:53.140> in<00:01:53.290> right<00:01:53.530> now<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.950> an<00:01:57.280> aquatic

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
sitting in right now this is an aquatic

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.999 
sitting in right now this is an aquatic
species<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.420> will<00:01:59.700> swim<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> surface<00:02:01.149> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
species it will swim to the surface and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.139 
species it will swim to the surface and
form<00:02:03.009> into<00:02:03.549> its<00:02:03.939> adult<00:02:05.399> morph<00:02:06.399> which<00:02:07.000> is

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
form into its adult morph which is

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.550 
form into its adult morph which is
called<00:02:07.360> molting

March<00:02:22.510> April<00:02:24.239> that's<00:02:25.239> why<00:02:25.510> we<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.959> fish<00:02:26.260> small

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
March April that's why we do fish small

I'm not an expert by any means I wish I
knew<00:03:38.440> them<00:03:38.560> all<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.930> yeah<00:03:44.260> we<00:03:44.380> got<00:03:44.500> about<00:03:44.590> five

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
knew them all but yeah we got about five

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.530 
knew them all but yeah we got about five

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.160 

okay<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.590> species<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.190> mayfly<00:04:07.020> doesn't<00:04:08.020> have

okay this species of mayfly doesn't have

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.960 
okay this species of mayfly doesn't have

too big and tinning like those other
species<00:04:10.300> we've<00:04:10.690> showed<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.920> has<00:04:12.100> one<00:04:12.910> more

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
species we've showed and it has one more

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.430 
species we've showed and it has one more
tail<00:04:14.020> Searcy<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:15.040> well<00:04:15.370> which<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.660> backs

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
tail Searcy as well which is the backs

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.520 
tail Searcy as well which is the backs
of<00:04:17.620> their<00:04:17.769> tails<00:04:18.010> here<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.489> see<00:04:19.530> much

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
of their tails here you can see much

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.130 
of their tails here you can see much
shorter<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.549> if<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.240> actually<00:04:22.420> pulled<00:04:22.900> him<00:04:23.110> off

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
shorter and if I actually pulled him off

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.200 
shorter and if I actually pulled him off
this<00:04:23.500> rock<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.340> got<00:04:24.460> him<00:04:24.580> dry<00:04:24.880> there<00:04:25.090> would<00:04:25.180> be

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
this rock and got him dry there would be

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.050 
this rock and got him dry there would be
three<00:04:25.950> Searcy<00:04:26.950> there<00:04:27.160> instead<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.490> two<00:04:27.790> in

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
three Searcy there instead of two in

three Searcy there instead of two in

we have two different species this is

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:35.989 
we have two different species this is
our<00:06:32.099> golden<00:06:32.759> stone<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:34.800> they<00:06:35.129> typically<00:06:35.639> you

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:35.999 
our golden stone and they typically you

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:37.939 
our golden stone and they typically you
can<00:06:36.179> tell<00:06:36.360> he's<00:06:36.569> golden<00:06:37.050> by<00:06:37.259> the<00:06:37.319> yellowish

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
can tell he's golden by the yellowish
