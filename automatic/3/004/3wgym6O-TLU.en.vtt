00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
basically made for right-handed players

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.939 
basically made for right-handed players
only<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.390> does<00:00:18.660> work<00:00:18.900> obviously<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
only it does work obviously on a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
only it does work obviously on a
left-handed<00:00:20.490> guitar<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.210> you've<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> do

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
left-handed guitar but you've got to do

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.630 
left-handed guitar but you've got to do
it<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.529> differently<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.490> was

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it a little bit differently so if I was

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
it a little bit differently so if I was
right-handed<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.650> have

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
right-handed right now all I would have

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730 
right-handed right now all I would have
to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.970> put<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> end<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.050> flip

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to do is put it on the end here and flip

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.659 
to do is put it on the end here and flip
it<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> turn<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:31.610> as<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it this way but when I turn it on as you

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.350 
it this way but when I turn it on as you
can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:34.219> everything<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> upside-down<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.239> me

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
can see everything is upside-down for me

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
can see everything is upside-down for me
so<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> improvise<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> sort

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so I have to improvise so I have to sort

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
so I have to improvise so I have to sort
of<00:00:40.590> put<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> guitar<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
of put it on the back of the guitar and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440 
of put it on the back of the guitar and
face<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.780> towards<00:00:43.230> me<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.309> big<00:00:44.520> deal<00:00:44.789> but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
face it towards me it's no big deal but

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
face it towards me it's no big deal but
it's<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> those<00:00:46.170> things<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.760> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's just one of those things where you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
it's just one of those things where you
know<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.329> never<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> make<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
know you're never going to make a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
know you're never going to make a
left-handed<00:00:49.829> tune<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> never<00:00:50.789> thought<00:00:51.059> I'd

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
left-handed tune up I never thought I'd

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.000 
left-handed tune up I never thought I'd
say<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.739> things

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
say that but it's one of those things

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.910 
say that but it's one of those things
where<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> improvise<00:00:54.899> slightly<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
where I have to improvise slightly and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
where I have to improvise slightly and
if<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> lefty<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:57.719> tuners

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if you're a lefty some of these tuners

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
if you're a lefty some of these tuners
might<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> pain<00:00:59.250> so<00:01:00.120> let's<00:01:00.270> turn

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
might be a bit of a pain so let's turn

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.789 
might be a bit of a pain so let's turn
it<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.730> if<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.820> strike<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> e<00:01:03.270> note<00:01:06.619> little<00:01:07.619> ring

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it on if I strike the e note little ring

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.590 
it on if I strike the e note little ring
that's<00:01:08.280> dead<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.210> tune

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
that's dead on tune

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.010 
that's dead on tune
I<00:01:10.720> was<00:01:11.229> doing<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.530> with<00:01:11.710> my<00:01:11.860> Gibson<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.780> would

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
I was doing this with my Gibson it would

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.490 
I was doing this with my Gibson it would
be<00:01:14.170> added<00:01:14.590> tune<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.960> that's<00:01:17.140> what<00:01:17.320> keeps

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
be added tune because that's what keeps

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.300 
be added tune because that's what keeps
them<00:01:17.680> stirred

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.190 

so<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.370> works<00:01:24.580> relatively<00:01:24.970> well<00:01:25.180> I<00:01:25.600> mean<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:26.020> is

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so it works relatively well I mean it is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.100 
so it works relatively well I mean it is
pretty<00:01:26.860> straightforward<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.720> doesn't<00:01:29.020> have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
pretty straightforward it doesn't have

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.680 
pretty straightforward it doesn't have
different<00:01:29.530> modes<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.310> runs<00:01:30.880> those<00:01:31.210> flat

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
different modes it runs those flat

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.350 
different modes it runs those flat
batteries<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.860> see<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.430> watches<00:01:33.970> in<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
batteries that you see in watches in the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480 
batteries that you see in watches in the
back<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.080> they're<00:01:35.500> very<00:01:35.650> lightweight<00:01:35.920> cheap

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
back so they're very lightweight cheap

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.990 
back so they're very lightweight cheap
and<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.960> whole<00:01:38.140> thing<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.770> very<00:01:39.070> very<00:01:39.490> small

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
and the whole thing is very very small

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.450 
and the whole thing is very very small
it's<00:01:40.780> about<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.050> size<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.500> two<00:01:41.740> tuning<00:01:42.190> pegs

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
it's about the size of two tuning pegs

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.740 
it's about the size of two tuning pegs
so<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.660> tiny<00:01:43.990> it's<00:01:44.440> like<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:45.580> reliable<00:01:46.240> it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
so it's tiny it's like it's reliable it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.690 
so it's tiny it's like it's reliable it
does<00:01:47.050> get<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.260> little<00:01:47.350> confused<00:01:48.010> sometimes<00:01:48.070> if

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
does get a little confused sometimes if

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.490 
does get a little confused sometimes if
there's<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> bass<00:01:49.690> player<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.290> room

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
there's it's a a bass player in the room

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.480 
there's it's a a bass player in the room
or<00:01:50.680> vibration<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.910> notes<00:01:52.650> I've<00:01:53.650> had<00:01:54.160> trouble

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
or vibration of notes I've had trouble

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.480 
or vibration of notes I've had trouble
with<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.729> before<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.530> occasionally<00:01:56.530> your

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
with it before and occasionally your

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.310 
with it before and occasionally your
voice<00:01:57.670> will<00:01:58.030> trigger<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.509> which<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.050> bit<00:01:59.229> of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
voice will trigger it which is a bit of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.109 
voice will trigger it which is a bit of
a<00:01:59.380> pain<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.800> e

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.139 

anyway<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.590> can't<00:02:05.590> hit<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.860> properly<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:06.970> that's

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
anyway I can't hit a properly so that's

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.060 
anyway I can't hit a properly so that's
it<00:02:07.360> that's<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.380> cork<00:02:08.850> pc1<00:02:09.850> tuna<00:02:10.780> I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
it that's all it is the cork pc1 tuna I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.810 
it that's all it is the cork pc1 tuna I
got<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.430> like<00:02:13.020> $19<00:02:14.020> Australian<00:02:14.820> it's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
got this for like $19 Australian it's

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820
