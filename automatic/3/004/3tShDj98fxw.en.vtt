 hello welcome back to our 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.570
 freedom blog peru.com and our 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.640
 youtube channel and today we basically go 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.650
 to be talking about the table 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.770
 amortization and it really is a table of 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.230
 motivation as the afternoon amortization in 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.510
 a series of documents that are delivered to you 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.920
 or you buy your property many of the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.380
 Sometimes the clients what they do is that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.050
 the chivas in those with the scriptures or 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.450
 the chivas in personal documents 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.400
 they have them in their house and if 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.400
 they knew that those two like this are and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 also so important 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.180
 to be able to achieve and save your house 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.370
 in 7 or 10 years is basically what it is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.400
 an amortization table in what 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.430
 next as you buy your property 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.140
 you buy your mortgage loan on 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.630
 state guarantee or not only have to charge 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 by law that that table is going to say how much 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.240
 you pay from the beginning and with that you 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 interest payment 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.800
 now remember that the bank always 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.780
 they're going to just work at the first and how 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 they have always told us I have not always 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.260
 educated you first pay the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 interests and then you pay the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.610
 main thing that happens there the most 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.890
 of the loans 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.620
 you can amortize as we said 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.930
 several times because as a depreciation is 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.740
 ok, you have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 suppose with your loan is 300 thousand 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.440
 730 years 360 months since you have your 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 payment number 1 your payment number one we're going to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.880
 suppose you pay a thousand dollars 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.780
 monthly of a mortgage loan 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.790
 normal as percent what they 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.290
 they pay today any mortgage today 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.310
 In Puerto Rico 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.830
 suppose you have 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.650
 the payment also dollars you pay this 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.900
 of interest and you pay this for 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.880
 main this in the number one payment 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.060
 because interests will always be greater 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.640
 and the main base the minor that happens 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.510
 When you amortize you will pay 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.630
 payment number 360 what does that mean that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.390
 you are going to pay this principal and 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.300
 this of interest when you are going to do 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.300
 your payments for you pay number one 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.549
 and pay 360 what happens I 'm 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.540
 interest this is principal or that this 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.049
 is gradually approaching little by little and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.519
 this is going to be reduced assuming 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.769
 basically that process to take 7 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.739
 to 10 years that happens super we are at 30 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.810
 you are saving almost 20 years of 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.940
 interest with you amortizes because 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.769
 you are paying the principal and it is 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.019
 interest that you are going to 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.019
 pay at that moment that 360 payment 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.269
 you at the time a very strong thing 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.769
 activity a scope note is that if it reads 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.630
 in which a little more of your 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.630
 budget to make payments 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.740
 but something to make that payment is that you 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.410
 take a check out of a letter a letter 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.740
 until that day with a lot of patience and 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.380
 patience on Saturday day of your week 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.510
 free and you more sex for your house and it goes 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.640
 to be doing shift and will focus as 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.100
 officer raised because more a letter 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.020
 general and you use every month for 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.360
 the next ten years to make a 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.610
 payment of your mortgage to pay for 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.560
 understand that much easier or pay the 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.510
 Express bonds do not you take your time 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.680
 and you will go to the bank you will be your 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.410
 letter and will put this payment of this 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.320
 check with check number 0 004 at one 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.470
 example is to pay my monthly payment 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.220
 current of the mortgage and this check 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.160
 the 0 05 basis to pay the principal of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.200
 your mortgage or your amortization in your 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.390
 mortgage is very important that you go 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.340
 officer and that clarifies that to the officer 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.190
 of bank so that the bank officer 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.009
 Now apply the normal payment with very 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.080
 Imposing cost has to do 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.939
 the payment of principal clickers 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.460
 main because you have to do it yes 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.390
 because unfortunately you pay for the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.970
 internet or pay through a 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.530
 the cashier by the mailbox with the express 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.230
 you are going to pay 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.420
 they will apply the payment to the number of 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.920
 accounts will pay the payment of the 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.840
 mortgage and they go to that payment for 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.420
 amortization that will be different to the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.070
 normal mortgage payment and they will 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.070
 leave there for is in the air going to 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.440
 have in the system of them without knowing 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.050
 where are they going to apply that is the money that 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.330
 it happens that instead of you overtaking and 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.070
 for the main you logisticians in the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.290
 that is making accelerated payments what 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.850
 which is not convenient for you because 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.860
 paid pagan is like paying for 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.530
 early and almost to a bank you do not 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.570
 can you do not have to pay does not affect 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.860
 to credit and that if you're not fixed that 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.480
 is doing the bank a favor what are you 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.520
 paying in advance what they 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.230
 they want that the idea is that you 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.610
 save and for that we are here to 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.380
