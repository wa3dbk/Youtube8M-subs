00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.139
 I'm going to read something that I found is very 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.840
 interesting and very important for 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.279
 those who like acne 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.289
 funimation chenel is a chain of 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.019
 American television that broadcasts 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.220
 anime japanese animation 24 hours 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.590
 of the day 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.910
 the series projected in the signal are 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.600
 all company properties 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.760
 funymation olympusat one was chosen 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.609
 as the exclusive distributor of the 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.710
 chain funimation chenel is the second 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:39.499
 American television channel in 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.100
 broadcast anime all day being anime 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:45.769
 network operated by art films the first 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 in Latin America we will have something 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.519
 like 2014 will be a dream year 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.530
 During 2013, several companies have 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.049
 announced his intention to launch 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.239
 Japanese animation in Latin America and 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.969
 much of it being series and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.979
 bold for the territory is something that 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.350
 It sounds good at first but 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.710
 will be that a wonder capable of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.530
 sustain in time let's start from 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.659
 the beginning for our joy 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.909
 the planets have aligned with our 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.940
 please and it's an excellent time to be 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.030
 a fan of the anime series as I am 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.890
 a goddess and now that dancing with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.530
 vampires and the knights of the zodiac 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.649
 mega have already confirmed their arrival at 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.659
 territory between this year and next 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.060
 also new actors as core 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.009
 international magness films and joey 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 entertainment have appeared for 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.799
 meet our wishes and requests 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.899
 even it is not ruled out that the very same 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.450
 animation entertainment have 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.659
 currently to Latin America between eyebrow and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.060
 eyebrow as a future goal if it is 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.460
 something that is really happening and not 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 only in the wet dreams of the cacos 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.930
 undoubtedly knowing that this is the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.600
 current situation is nice to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.580
 listening indicates that companies 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 they consider that the niche in which we 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.750
 we find if it has the potential to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.090
 become a car industry 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.190
 sustainable which makes them look at 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.730
 us seriously and it causes a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 ecosystem that encourages competition 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.880
 directly benefiting the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.340
 buyers to access products each 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.560
 more attractive times 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.480
 however I regret being the bad guy 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.070
 movie that I planted in the next 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.900
 question is our niche what 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.290
 large enough to 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.850
 sustain a similar number of actors 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 although the center and south of america 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.560
 they have been territories practically 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.019
 unexplored in the sale of anime in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 home format in the last decade not 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.310
 we can deny that the first objective of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 the vast majority of companies before 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.860
 named is only one mexico is it perhaps the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.959
 north country a market like to 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.660
 keep so many new companies 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.030
 that also come to compete with 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.700
 companies already established as on screen 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.310
 tower system and entertainment 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.769
 I think this is a sensitive issue that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.230
 companies should take with caution already 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.930
 that being an emerging market is still 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.610
 very fragile, let's take as an example the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.700
 current towers strategy 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.550
 entertainment because they do not release all their 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.769
 series at a time which is the reason why 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.140
 the last talk box of sailor moon no 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.239
 has been put up for sale exactly 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.150
 at the same time as the knights of the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.970
 zodiac 12 houses master edition if they are 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.580
 different series simple no 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.590
 overexploit the market or cause a 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.319
 self competition between their own 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.010
 products that would be nothing 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.360
 smart in such a limited environment 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.150
 we agree although the anime 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.980
 It has always been popular in Latin America 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.840
 nevertheless the niche that has the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.840
 ability and the will to buy 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.120
 original products is not infinite the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.160
 about populating licensed products a 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.560
 such a small market would imply a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.049
 inevitable collapse in the future since the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.120
 potential buyers would not reach 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.330
 to cover the expenses of all 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.790
 releases at the same time or failing 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.800
 they would buy unknown series or little 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.080
 striking in favor of series more 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.130
 popular in which they decide to spend their 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.560
 income will be 2014 the birth of 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.510
 an anime paradise in latin america 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.150
 that lasts in time or by 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.120
 contrary the genesis of a bubble of 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.550
 Anime similar to the situation in the USA 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.590
 early 2000 that ended during 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.750
 that same decade with the dramatic 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.900
 disappearance of companies like Gideon 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.820
 band and visual so central to comedy 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.930
 in the purest style of a row of 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.750
 domino's luck to everyone involved 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.360
 as of 2014 only the strongest 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.240
 will live to tell 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.280
 now I want to read your opinions believe 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.800
 that the market could collapse in a 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.320
 future with so many companies involved 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.050
 or on the contrary everything will be fine and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.880
 it will even improve over time I hope 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.620
 your comments 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.300
 friends I think the best way to 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.070
 that works is animation is to support 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.960
 the dubbing actors I'm sure that 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.669
 many of you prefer to watch anime in 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.230
 Japanese that's why in Latin America 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.840
 specifically in mexico 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.520
 dubbing actors are very poorly paid to 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.200
 Personally, I do not care if I'm 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.790
 in Spanish or in Latin because I think that 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.380
 we all enter the world of anime 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.930
 looking at it for the first time in 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.130
 television and in Spanish so let yourself 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.140
 of yards and support the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.910
 Latin Americans for sure there will be a fucking 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.800
 aveniente that says to encourage you in Japanese 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.480
 because the Latino is censored because that 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.100
 to be called funimation chanel excuse no 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.900
 has censorship and if I had it I do not think 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.790
 that was a lot so let's stop 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.470
 mothers, we are all Latin Americans 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.210
 we must support each other so that 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.010
 we enter the world of anime 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.110
 watching him on television in Latin 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.670
 Many children can also know this 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.440
 wonderful world but of a better 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.120
 way with impeccable dubbing since 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.770
 we would pay more to the actors of 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.900
 the grace there would be many who would work 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.360
 with enthusiasm and would work 20 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.220
 sure we would like very much so 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.070
 points to assess the national product already 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.570
 stop shaking your teacher says goodbye 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.580
