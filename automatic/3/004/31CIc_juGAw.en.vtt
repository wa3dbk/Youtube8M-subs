00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 as only that the madrid being able this video 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.690
 to answer two questions right. 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.240
 that one was placed on the rope 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 right belt withdrawal machine, 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.460
 that was to ask if on the belt of from 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.160
 Toothed belt also had the rope 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 I do not remember the name of my colleague but I 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 I'll put it right here on behalf of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 colleague who asked me the question I answer 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.190
 yea 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.239
 here I found the rope only that is a little 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.469
 thinner and also another question that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.200
 was made 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.980
 asking if this rope could be 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.030
 Good to start fire as fire bait 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 because it has part of it in this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.340
 Rope She Rubbed 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 So I got the stuff you got here. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.439
 back in the woods right 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.250
 and I found some little flowers that have 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.680
 The good downs to this and I will. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.700
 to start with a match a match 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.610
 and here the string we will see if it will give 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.610
 Alright then it 's good so let's go guys 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.580
 I have here a piece of rope here. 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.579
 on that toothed belt I took around 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.960
 The rope is about 6 meters or less 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:39.850
 here i'll set her on fire to see 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 What can we do then? 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.610
 the beautiful moscone because of the rubber a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:13.519
 burns well, it inflames well for 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.360
 I just do not think I'll help you there. 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.360
 stay there folks there 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.410
 foot on the first try she paid here 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.830
 master 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 in case it's already new, let's go way 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 see what happens 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.570
 I believe that, yes, people do not 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.920
 although it is not a thing of the past 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.520
 wonderful yes but I think for 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.830
 help start the fire the one who 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.830
 This little string can be a good 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.630
 alternative 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:35.240
 If you need to, then do not help 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.230
 beginning to fire 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.970
 I think it can be a good 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.280
 alternative that was already successful with 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.440
 rope 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.370
 I think I do think it can be a 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.290
 alternative way to help in the choice 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 Of coconut 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.050
 only then is the tip wakes up taken 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 this time from a timing belt 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:09.950
 car coming on fire on the next 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.950
 then earned sound
