layer down here we're gonna paste that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.390 
layer down here we're gonna paste that
control<00:01:09.060> V<00:01:09.650> now<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.130> ahead<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
control V now we want to go ahead and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
control V now we want to go ahead and
readjust<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> size<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.630> want
