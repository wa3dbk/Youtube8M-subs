00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
 good we new a new video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 I come to bring a little a little 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
 analysis of the trailer that has come out of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.590
 black ops 3 as you know before then I've 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 given some clues have come out many 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.060
 more obviously after making the video 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.849
 it was clear that many 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.919
 many many new tracks and good 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.910
 basically one of the first 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:26.279
 You are watching, I do not know if I do it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.769
 order or what but well let's do it 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.679
 Well, first of all, a new one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.710
 location a new location that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.480
 basically it takes us to a prison in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 zürich 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 basically, little by little we can 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.500
 to say of her the truth simply 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 it is a more location and it is already 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 As you know, before, it has also 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 I left the image that I have done before 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.870
 it was also from a location then 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.240
 then we will delve deeper into it let's go 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 also to some oriental letters that 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.430
 they appear obviously I could not know 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 what they mean for me impossible for me 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.309
 understanding of oriental languages ​​and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 besides, I do not get any more, I do not know what 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.600
 we would get out of conclusion 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 what it says and it's really a bit difficult 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.260
 the truth say or define what it is that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.820
 really puts in place then also 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.620
 in the next image I am living that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.550
 I am going to appear again the little symbol that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.560
 of the trident 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.790
 that we had previously seen 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.630
 possibly it will be very present in the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.520
 game will be some kind of faction or something 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 like that very possibly is something 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.120
 quite likely already many as well 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.790
 they rate it that how good it is 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.010
 symbol of some war and others or of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.450
 some special operations and everything 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.000
 this with which possibly also what 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 we have very present as a faction 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.159
 inside him 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.350
 of the game so there's nothing that 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.330
 investigate more about him though 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.830
 well possibly on day 26 let's get out of 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.479
 doubts that as you know is going to be the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.460
 departure date of the trailer then 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.409
 we also passed a thing from the end that 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.720
 I found it quite curious to see 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.240
 what 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.070
 in the position that has the soldier 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080
 that appears at the end because it is exactly 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.180
 the same as the cover that the cover 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.430
 that we have in the black ops 1 this 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.750
 basically then added what exists in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 the trailer that everything we had 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.970
 been doing it has been wrong that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.550
 good that such and what and all 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.650
 it was wrong and we have seen the side the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.990
 opposite side and all this then 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.880
 basically it makes me think that we're going to 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.130
 return to have an old war very 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 possible quite possibly and something that happened 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.540
 between 1 and 2 or maybe a good 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.610
 Pretty much, I honestly believe 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.030
 what I think is that he will understand 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.900
 quite pretty quite epoch goes to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.490
 be many years I do not know if I explain it goes to 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.459
 be old but for many years maybe 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.350
 of a course of 30 or 20 years that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.200
 it would be something quite big obviously in 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.330
 many weapons that we could have not 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.820
 the story is going to be of quite a few dates 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.950
 very probably seeing then others 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.930
 sides other points of view and other 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 things that maybe because we had been 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.200
 wrongly doing or watching from the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.480
 wrong way as well says 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 in the trailer not even then we could 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.010
 have as I say so many winks towards 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.019
 asia black ops 1 even of weapons that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.660
 they return maps to the best they come back and 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.730
 other things that come back and all this 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.110
 It would be a good excuse to go back to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 see different things from one of the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.610
 favorite games of the saga that was 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.140
 black ops 1 one of the games that has most 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.030
 liked to the general public then 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.640
 we also go to the photo that had already 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.760
 said before that basically because we 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.489
 took to the bridge on October 6 and 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.380
 others with a location to a war 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.780
 of the yom kippur war of 73 other 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.269
 another year that could be linked 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.040
 as I say to the game and also only in the 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.019
 Element 115 that is again present 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.299
 many I have seen it and I liked the first 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.269
 time but it's already obvious from super 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.950
 obvious that game to have zombies is 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.420
 very clear or that is to have it clear of 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.890
 done I think it was confirmed long ago 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.040
 time that would see FONVIS 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.570
 in this call of duty that we would know to 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 have it also fixed that a little symbol 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.100
 pretty weird I do not know if you see it up to 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.710
 the left 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.930
 they do not really know what means of 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.260
 fact is that there are many without balls in 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.720
 the trailer is difficult to know and to find out 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.060
 what are all and others or make one 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.440
 idea that they can be there are not very many 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.360
 things 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.980
 hid inside the trailer obviously 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.410
 as he has repeated it, it is to know the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.590
 it's all a bit difficult not the following 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.680
 quite impossible but good 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.650
 we can tie by tying ends 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.600
 about what we will be able to see in the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.940
 game mostly because of their locations 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.890
 and many others say that the location 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.020
 that comes out in this image because it could be 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.270
 also how good that is going for us 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.920
 is going to Egypt the east bridge and that could 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.930
 be something like we could have the 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.580
 first map of the zombies even now 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.680
 there are people what are we going to have mummies 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.200
 zombie I really do not know 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.530
 obviously I do not know but I think that 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.270
 that we are going to have an average of time 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.680
 pretty broad I really do not 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.180
 I would like nothing that was again 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.730
 futurist would be a bitch the pretty 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.050
 big and I guess what you expect from 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.240
 the majority is that it is not a game 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.610
 Futuristic that is everything everything 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.350
 otherwise older and so on and I think 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.600
 that this image of the end that already 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.760
 we had seen before the soldier that 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.470
 It appears as in the black cover 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.150
 ops 1 could you tell us that we are going to 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.880
 have another point of view of that same 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.060
 game we will see to see what happens 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.940
 for now nothing is defined at a hundred 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.250
 hundred and you have to do it if possible 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.350
 speculations you can not say anything even 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.790
 confirm nothing at the moment but 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.040
 different clues as they are there and 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.500
 logically then also so that the 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.630
 we discover not for what they have done to us 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.890
 reason to put numbers at random and already 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.830
 it's so good if all these 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.860
 locations and other Switzerland the cairo 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.750
 Egypt and all this because it's all there is 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.760
 because it's going to be related to the 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.620
 game somehow the element 115 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.420
 there are also in the east the different 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.020
 symbols and all this 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.390
 well basically singapore if I do not 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.770
 I'm wrong in a school with what then 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.170
 well there we have several locations 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.660
 that we could go pulling and well then 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.930
 thinking that they are going to treat something of 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.640
 he of the game but good to know to know 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.580
 that we sneak this time is that we have 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.990
 in the game and all this for now as 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.300
 I will repeat until the 26th no 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.750
 we will leave doubts and nothing we will see to see 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.550
 I will make a video reaction that day 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.930
 obviously because good possibly 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.300
 everyone upload the trailer but good 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.680
 I want to upload my way of taking me 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.450
 things though good and we all know 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.310
 that then what you see in the trailer and 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.680
 what we play the game not 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.780
 it seems then not a shit and we just 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.190
 regretting nothing more guys this has 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.970
 been everything and nothing we go in the next 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.970
 video until next time
