00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.539
 like animal in flash a symbol on a background in a beginning 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.419
 We now add an animation always using symbols to the 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.810
 document that we had already created with the background of the flowers 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.840
 inside all row documents 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 we have an item called a library inside this library it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.580
 store the different symbols that we have been creating in our case of 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.710
 moment we only have one flower 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 we had become a symbol to be able to duplicate it all over the stage 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.040
 was symbol in flash it's like a small independent movie if I or 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.920
 the team on it I can access this your timeline and you could see 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 how do I have or frame in a layer 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 in the timeline of this flower 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 he could also see the symbol route in the upper part of the stage that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 it's going to help me to move around because they could go back to the scene again 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.570
 what I'm going to use now is going to be a symbol 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.080
 you're out of this movie I'm going to use symbols from another movie 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.020
 different 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.070
 for that I'm going to file 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800
 to import 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.340
 open external libitec 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.880
 this will allow to select a file in this case rabbits 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 from which I'm going to draw his elements he selected to open pulse 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.630
 she has that open library here I have the different canada dolls 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 move around me animation 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.550
 to be able to animate objects in flash 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.910
 It is necessary that each of them is in an independent stage 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.340
 so I'll start by creating a new layer blocked the flower layer 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.350
 and in the layer above 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370
 added a new layer 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.460
 selected 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.580
 the man disguised as a carrot dragged him on stage 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.600
 and I have an element in that new layer I will zoom out to give the best 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 and I'm going to put the layer on the carrot name 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.749
 distinguish as much as possible this is a good habit 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.749
 You can add two more layers to add a couple of rabbits 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.669
 dragged rabbit on stage 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.669
 I put the name rabbit 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.959
 add a new stage 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.970
 I add second rabbit a crawling on stage 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.119
 as a name 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.339
 rabbit 2 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.839
 As I have already prepared, I will minimize the library so that I do not 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:31.799
 strange 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.049
 clicking on the edge of the scene and dragging it down could see all 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.599
 the layers that I have so far 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.939
 I have six layers that correspond to the background and the elements that I will animate 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.359
 to be able to animate elements 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.359
 always b needs at least two keyframes 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.249
 keyframes that are these points 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.909
 tell me changes in a particular element in a layer 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.680
 well in the carrots and I want you to run from the right to the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.609
 left of the stage 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.550
 what I have to do is have a first keyframe where it appears 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.940
 and a second keyframe beyond in time beyond in the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.849
 frames 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.010
 where will he have his final position 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.149
 so I hit the right button 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.790
 insert Keyframe 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.459
 and new the carrot from side to side 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.319
 received that I have two different positions 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.299
 the rest of the elements in the timeline have disappeared 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.899
 as we can see here there is nothing 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.809
 more than that eastern area and therefore neither appear on stage 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.930
 only in the first frame 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 that is where adif grants more with them inside 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.719
 I'm going to keep cheering up carrots so we can see that you only have 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.659
 two positions 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.939
 an initial and a final 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.989
 and if the new ones allow finding the intermediate position in each of the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.099
 frames 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.169
 for this he selected an intermediate frame 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.819
 now the properties panel in the drop-down will animate you diego 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.009
 movement 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:56.399
 minimized the property panel and we see that you have created a line with a 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.829
 blue color background 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.829
 that tells me there is a side-by-side animation 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.439
 of a symbol within itself also has its own nation 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.239
 double click on it as we can see before but here I also have 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.709
 a series of layers and a series of frames 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.709
 that have the animation of the running dummy 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.689
 simple box start up green that doll running side by side the 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:20.930
 stage 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.289
 it could be that rabbits are also running 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.629
 for that he selected the frame 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.889
 first of the first rabbit 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.809
 and once selected clicked and dragged 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.979
 to make it ashton frame 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.979
 a little further 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.759
 what I'm going to get with this this 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.779
 first the doll appears running and a little while later the first one appears 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.189
 rabbit and I will do the same as before 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.580
 he selected a photo ramÃ³n little beyond 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.650
 inserted a keyframe and the new from side to side of the stage 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.469
 sincere second rabbit 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.330
 I put it a little further back in time in frame 53 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 uncertain keyframe 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.740
 and I also move it to the other side of the stage 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.830
 selected intermediate frames of both layers 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.599
 in the properties panel gave him encourage 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.759
 movement 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.189
 with them I already have the two rabbits 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.289
 running behind the carrot 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.289
 of course I want the background to remain throughout the vibration 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.989
 as it's a static background I do not need keyframes I'm going to do is going to be 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.989
 select those three frames in those three layers 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.499
 and with the right button I'm going to say insert your program 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:45.819
 that will damage me dir static frames during the animation 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.639
 I already have this ready 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.150
 if I go to control 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
 try movie I will see the result this image 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.620
 moss see what happens first the artistic name of carrot 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.240
 and a little later 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 the rabbits 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.589
 using this system I can make the desired animation much more 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.080
 complex for example 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.330
 I can add several more layers with the example I'm going to open 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.460
 and each of them a rabbit 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.759
 so I'm going to get it to have 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.759
 good animation a little more complex 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.729
