know i do believe bob arum was the main

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.690 
know i do believe bob arum was the main
reason<00:02:54.230> why<00:02:54.920> uh<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.860> pacquiao<00:02:58.250> made<00:02:58.460> with<00:02:58.610> a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
reason why uh the pacquiao made with a

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.490 
reason why uh the pacquiao made with a
fight<00:02:58.910> didn't<00:02:59.270> happen<00:02:59.570> this<00:02:59.780> time<00:02:59.840> in<00:03:00.350> my

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
fight didn't happen this time in my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.170 
fight didn't happen this time in my
opinion<00:03:00.740> I<00:03:00.980> think<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.250> main<00:03:01.400> problem<00:03:01.670> was<00:03:01.940> Bob

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
opinion I think the main problem was Bob

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.720 
opinion I think the main problem was Bob
Arum<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.600> think<00:03:02.780> Bob<00:03:02.930> Arum<00:03:03.230> was<00:03:04.190> really<00:03:04.460> trying

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
Arum I think Bob Arum was really trying

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.840 
Arum I think Bob Arum was really trying
to<00:03:04.790> block<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.240> fight<00:03:05.510> because<00:03:06.290> he<00:03:09.850> believed

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
to block the fight because he believed

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.170 
to block the fight because he believed
that<00:03:11.150> Pacquiao<00:03:11.930> was<00:03:12.080> gonna<00:03:12.290> lose<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.190> he

that<00:06:48.050> shit<00:06:48.229> I<00:06:48.289> just<00:06:48.349> think<00:06:48.710> Pacquiao<00:06:49.039> is<00:06:49.870> just

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
that shit I just think Pacquiao is just

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.659 
that shit I just think Pacquiao is just
the<00:06:51.050> diminishing<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.770> deteriorating<00:06:52.490> I

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
the diminishing and deteriorating I

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.370 
the diminishing and deteriorating I
think<00:06:53.150> the<00:06:53.240> pacquiao<00:06:53.599> fool<00:06:54.130> Chloe<00:06:55.539> I<00:06:56.539> would<00:06:57.199> I

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
think the pacquiao fool Chloe I would I

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.960 
think the pacquiao fool Chloe I would I
would<00:06:57.500> pick<00:06:57.800> him<00:06:57.830> pretty<00:06:58.250> strongly<00:06:58.639> to<00:06:58.849> be

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
would pick him pretty strongly to be

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.330 
would pick him pretty strongly to be
Bradley<00:06:59.449> but<00:06:59.660> I<00:06:59.960> don't<00:07:00.740> think<00:07:00.889> we've<00:07:01.069> got<00:07:01.220> our

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
Bradley but I don't think we've got our

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.040 
Bradley but I don't think we've got our
pack<00:07:01.550> er<00:07:01.729> no<00:07:01.940> more<00:07:02.120> man<00:07:02.300> we<00:07:02.449> gotta<00:07:02.630> pack<00:07:02.870> yo
