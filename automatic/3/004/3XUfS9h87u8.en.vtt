00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.540 

okay<00:00:05.420> so<00:00:05.480> I<00:00:05.660> did<00:00:05.960> a<00:00:05.990> video<00:00:06.260> on<00:00:06.740> replacing<00:00:07.069> a

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
okay so I did a video on replacing a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.419 
okay so I did a video on replacing a
brake<00:00:07.729> caliper<00:00:07.970> and<00:00:08.480> I<00:00:08.690> had<00:00:08.960> a<00:00:09.380> couple<00:00:10.220> of<00:00:10.309> good

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
brake caliper and I had a couple of good

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.170 
brake caliper and I had a couple of good
questions<00:00:10.640> about<00:00:11.110> how<00:00:12.310> much<00:00:13.310> force<00:00:13.880> a<00:00:14.030> person

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
questions about how much force a person

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.380 
questions about how much force a person
should<00:00:14.450> have<00:00:14.480> to<00:00:14.690> put<00:00:14.870> to<00:00:15.500> spin<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:16.039> rotor

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
should have to put to spin the rotor

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.790 
should have to put to spin the rotor
after<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.510> caliper<00:00:18.050> has<00:00:18.230> been<00:00:18.439> in<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:18.590> place

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
after the caliper has been in the place

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.560 
after the caliper has been in the place
there's<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.190> caliper<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:19.730> vehicle<00:00:20.150> here's<00:00:20.480> a

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
there's a caliper this vehicle here's a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.090 
there's a caliper this vehicle here's a
rotor<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:22.720> don't<00:00:23.720> really<00:00:24.199> think<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.710> showed<00:00:24.920> it

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
rotor I don't really think I showed it

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.189 
rotor I don't really think I showed it
too<00:00:25.279> well<00:00:25.550> in<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:25.820> video<00:00:26.119> because<00:00:26.690> I<00:00:26.810> had<00:00:27.020> at

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
too well in that video because I had at

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.099 
too well in that video because I had at
one<00:00:27.380> point<00:00:27.410> jacked<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:29.300> front<00:00:29.990> of<00:00:30.050> the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
one point jacked the front of the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.019 
one point jacked the front of the
vehicle<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.890> was<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.100> neutral<00:00:31.279> but<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.939> do

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
vehicle and it was in neutral but to do

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.569 
vehicle and it was in neutral but to do
that<00:00:32.180> you<00:00:32.390> go<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.509> really<00:00:33.550> make<00:00:34.550> sure

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
that you go to really make sure

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.399 
that you go to really make sure
everything<00:00:35.059> is<00:00:35.179> blocked<00:00:35.449> up<00:00:35.659> around<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.229> you

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:36.409 
everything is blocked up around and you

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:37.569 
everything is blocked up around and you
know<00:00:36.499> both<00:00:36.710> sides<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:37.129> our<00:00:37.219> vehicle

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
know both sides that our vehicle

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.619 
know both sides that our vehicle
everything<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.030> I'm<00:00:38.149> doing<00:00:38.269> a<00:00:38.359> little<00:00:38.479> other

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
everything so I'm doing a little other

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.959 
everything so I'm doing a little other
work<00:00:38.899> on<00:00:39.109> this<00:00:39.489> vehicle<00:00:40.489> but<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.609> know<00:00:40.729> try<00:00:40.940> to

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
work on this vehicle but I know try to

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.599 
work on this vehicle but I know try to
see<00:00:41.149> if<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.269> get<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.510> idea<00:00:41.809> across<00:00:41.870> here<00:00:42.609> at

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
see if we get the idea across here at

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.840 
see if we get the idea across here at
the<00:00:43.760> moment<00:00:44.089> I<00:00:44.359> have<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.409> brakes<00:00:45.699> operated<00:00:46.699> on

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
the moment I have the brakes operated on

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.419 
the moment I have the brakes operated on
this<00:00:46.969> video<00:00:47.799> so<00:00:49.960> see<00:00:50.960> here<00:00:51.199> I'm<00:00:51.350> trying<00:00:51.649> there

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
this video so see here I'm trying there

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.520 
this video so see here I'm trying there
wasn't<00:00:52.579> much<00:00:52.729> force<00:00:53.059> on<00:00:53.359> it<00:00:53.899> as<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.079> can<00:00:54.289> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
wasn't much force on it as I can and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.959 
wasn't much force on it as I can and
obviously<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:55.299> can't<00:00:56.299> turn<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.719> rotor<00:00:56.989> now

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
obviously I can't turn this rotor now

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.189 
obviously I can't turn this rotor now
even<00:00:58.969> once<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.299> release<00:00:59.569> release<00:01:00.139> the<00:01:01.030> brakes

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
even once I release release the brakes

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.250 
even once I release release the brakes
because<00:01:03.199> I<00:01:03.289> have<00:01:03.499> I<00:01:04.089> have<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.119> little<00:01:05.540> system

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
because I have I have a little system

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.080 
because I have I have a little system
geared<00:01:06.560> up<00:01:06.680> there<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.010> just<00:01:07.220> put<00:01:08.060> some

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
geared up there to just put some

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.780 
geared up there to just put some
pressure<00:01:08.300> on<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.780> brake<00:01:09.190> while<00:01:10.190> I'm<00:01:10.340> testing

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
pressure on the brake while I'm testing

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.080 
pressure on the brake while I'm testing
it<00:01:10.880> I'm<00:01:11.510> gonna<00:01:11.660> remove<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:13.310> force<00:01:13.790> on<00:01:14.000> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
it I'm gonna remove the force on the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.090 
it I'm gonna remove the force on the
brake<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.230> now<00:01:15.470> I'm<00:01:15.590> not<00:01:15.740> gonna<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:15.950> able<00:01:16.010> to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
brake and now I'm not gonna be able to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.690 
brake and now I'm not gonna be able to
spin<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.810> because<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.320> other<00:01:18.500> wheel<00:01:18.860> is<00:01:19.400> not

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
spin this because the other wheel is not

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.190 
spin this because the other wheel is not
jacked<00:01:20.030> up<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:20.450> hopefully<00:01:20.840> you'll<00:01:21.020> be<00:01:21.080> able

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
jacked up but hopefully you'll be able

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.950 
jacked up but hopefully you'll be able
to<00:01:21.380> get<00:01:21.500> an<00:01:21.590> idea<00:01:22.180> because<00:01:23.180> here's<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.690> pads

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to get an idea because here's the pads

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.510 
to get an idea because here's the pads
down<00:01:24.290> here<00:01:25.600> right<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:28.370> I<00:01:28.460> said

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
down here right in there and like I said

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.110 
down here right in there and like I said
this<00:01:29.450> rotor<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.160> immovable<00:01:31.160> but<00:01:31.760> I'm<00:01:32.030> just

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
this rotor is immovable but I'm just

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.390 
this rotor is immovable but I'm just
going<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.360> release<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.690> braking

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
going to release the braking

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.510 
going to release the braking
okay<00:01:34.730> so<00:01:34.790> now<00:01:35.060> I've<00:01:35.180> released<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> brake<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.810 

see<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.670> move<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.010> basically<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.550> ped's

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
see that move so so basically the ped's

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.899 
see that move so so basically the ped's
should<00:01:44.270> fully<00:01:44.540> retract<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.800> here<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.760> the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
should fully retract in here and the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.760 
should fully retract in here and the
caliper<00:01:47.260> CalPERS<00:01:48.260> should<00:01:48.409> be<00:01:48.500> have<00:01:48.620> no

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
caliper CalPERS should be have no

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.550 
caliper CalPERS should be have no
tension<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.659> one<00:01:50.659> second<00:01:51.050> turn<00:01:51.230> out<00:01:51.320> very

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
tension on this one second turn out very

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.000 
tension on this one second turn out very
easily<00:01:51.890> now<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:53.020> can<00:01:54.020> just<00:01:54.140> take<00:01:54.320> my<00:01:54.470> fingers<00:01:54.800> on

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
easily now I can just take my fingers on

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.109 
easily now I can just take my fingers on
the<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.300> rotor<00:01:56.510> itself<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:57.050> right

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.160 

so<00:02:01.119> that's<00:02:01.299> basically<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:01.930> should<00:02:02.080> be

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
so that's basically what should be

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.630 
so that's basically what should be
happening<00:02:02.290> if<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.770> rotor<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.190> operating

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
happening if the rotor is operating

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.230 
happening if the rotor is operating
properly

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
properly

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.300 
properly
now<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:04.900> I<00:02:04.990> said<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.590> had<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> other<00:02:06.010> side

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
now like I said if I had the other side

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.419 
now like I said if I had the other side
of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.490> vehicle<00:02:06.610> jacked<00:02:07.030> up<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.800> neutral<00:02:08.800> then

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
of the vehicle jacked up in neutral then

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.320
