to kind of sit back on because that's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.069

you're going to lunge forward and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
you're going to lunge forward and
ideally<00:02:14.370> you're<00:02:14.490> gonna<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.850> 90<00:02:15.180> degree

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
ideally you're gonna have 90 degree

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
problems then go a little bit more

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.630 
problems then go a little bit more
shallow<00:02:21.180> until<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.200> feel<00:02:22.500> stronger<00:02:23.130> with<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
shallow until you feel stronger with it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and you can always walk do walking

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
and you can always walk do walking
lunges<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.660> another<00:02:27.900> way<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> vary<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> up

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
lunges that's another way to vary it up

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.310 
lunges that's another way to vary it up
or<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.880> back<00:02:30.120> lunges<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.960> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
or you can do back lunges here that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.740 
or you can do back lunges here that
makes<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.800> little<00:02:31.980> harder<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.210> just<00:02:33.510> go

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
makes it a little harder so you just go

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.260 
makes it a little harder so you just go
backwards<00:02:34.590> instead<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.280> forwards<00:02:35.400> make<00:02:36.120> sure

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
backwards instead of forwards make sure

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.430 
backwards instead of forwards make sure
your<00:02:36.390> core<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.780> nice<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.290> tight<00:02:39.170> now<00:02:40.170> we're

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.350 
going to do a modified push-up so this
is<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> nice<00:02:43.700> modification<00:02:44.700> instead<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> doing

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
is a nice modification instead of doing

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.700 
is a nice modification instead of doing
it<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> ground<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.170> could<00:02:46.350> do<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.680> a

wondering<00:04:30.410> what<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.650> hell<00:04:30.800> you're<00:04:30.979> doing<00:04:31.310> but

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
wondering what the hell you're doing but

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.879 
wondering what the hell you're doing but
just<00:04:31.970> get<00:04:32.300> over<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:33.169> know<00:04:33.199> there<00:04:33.500> they're

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
just get over it you know there they're

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.730 
just get over it you know there they're
probably<00:04:34.039> more<00:04:34.430> envious<00:04:35.000> than<00:04:35.630> anything<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.710> I

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
probably more envious than anything so I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.909 
probably more envious than anything so I
tell<00:04:37.100> my<00:04:37.280> clients<00:04:37.520> they<00:04:38.000> can<00:04:38.330> do<00:04:38.570> one<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.590> four

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
tell my clients they can do one to four

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.100 
tell my clients they can do one to four
sets<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.580> these<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:41.000> mean<00:04:41.240> really<00:04:41.510> as<00:04:41.750> much<00:04:41.960> as

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
sets of these I mean really as much as

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
sets of these I mean really as much as
you<00:04:42.229> can<00:04:42.500> wherever<00:04:42.889> you<00:04:43.490> can<00:04:43.729> fit<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.180> be

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350 
you can wherever you can fit it in be
creative<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.430> cool<00:04:46.669> thing<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.210> that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
creative and the cool thing is is that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.900 
creative and the cool thing is is that
studies<00:04:47.630> are<00:04:47.900> proving<00:04:48.199> that<00:04:49.039> if<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.280> do<00:04:49.520> three

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
studies are proving that if you do three

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.300 
studies are proving that if you do three
10-minute<00:04:50.660> increments<00:04:50.960> it's<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.889> exact<00:04:52.280> same

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
10-minute increments it's the exact same

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.029 
10-minute increments it's the exact same
stressor<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.330> body<00:04:53.539> as<00:04:53.870> 30<00:04:54.740> straight

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
stressor on the body as 30 straight

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.490 
stressor on the body as 30 straight
minutes<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.150> know<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:56.960> have<00:04:57.199> 10
