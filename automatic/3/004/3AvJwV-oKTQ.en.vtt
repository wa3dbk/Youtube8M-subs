and look back the other important thing
is<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> way<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:14.880> doing<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
is the way you're doing it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.780 
is the way you're doing it
stitch<00:02:16.020> aligned<00:02:16.530> correctly<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> needle

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
stitch aligned correctly on the needle

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 
stitch aligned correctly on the needle
oh<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.930> exactly<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.280> you're

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
oh that's that's exactly right so you're

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.130 
oh that's that's exactly right so you're
not<00:02:20.580> twisting<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.210> stitches<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.050> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
not twisting your stitches so when you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.370 
not twisting your stitches so when you
go<00:02:22.320> back<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.710> other<00:02:22.740> way<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.930> went<00:02:25.200> in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
go back the other way so if I went in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.830 
go back the other way so if I went in
underneath<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.690> be

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
underneath here like this I would be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.450 
underneath here like this I would be
twisting<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.620> wouldn't<00:02:28.950> want<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.430> that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
twisting it you wouldn't want to do that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.060 
twisting it you wouldn't want to do that
you<00:02:30.300> want<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.570> go<00:02:30.690> back<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.770> you're<00:02:31.920> just
