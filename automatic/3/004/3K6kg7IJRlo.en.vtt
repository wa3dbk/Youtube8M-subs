Jordan is a parental control that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
Jordan is a parental control that
basically<00:01:21.450> records<00:01:21.960> every<00:01:22.170> single<00:01:22.500> activity

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
basically records every single activity

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.910 
basically records every single activity
that<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.490> child<00:01:23.790> does<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> laptop<00:01:24.920> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that a child does with this laptop and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
that a child does with this laptop and
all<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> these<00:01:26.430> activity<00:01:27.000> remains<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
all of these activity remains in the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
all of these activity remains in the
system<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> child<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.979> delete<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
system so a child can not delete it so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
system so a child can not delete it so
you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.960> each<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> the
