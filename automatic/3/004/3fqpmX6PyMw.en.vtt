00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.790
 good afternoon friends today I come with a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.800
 new video about mexico and its curse 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.380
 in the world that is already a tradition 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.590
 here in Mexico, well, I'm going to start with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 What made this World Cup in Brazil-2014 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.860
 first played against cameroon in the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 we won 1 to 0 with goal by oribe peralta 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.600
 the match before was already in the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 bag and despite the invalidated goals 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 towards him giovani two saints we could 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 get the win the next game 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 it was against Brazil as you know 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 we tie thanks to memo ochoa we played 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.410
 well but even so brazil stoned us the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 ranch the next game was against 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.340
 Croatia was enough for us to draw 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.559
 to qualify but mexico did not stay 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 back and looked for the triumph from the beginning 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 thanks to this in the second time 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 We were totally superior to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.200
 Croats with the result of three to one 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.329
 the last game was in strength towards 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430
 very hot and that favored the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.800
 Mexicans since the Dutch are not 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 adapted to this type of heat mexico is 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.130
 took advantage of it to make a goal of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.740
 giovanni in the second half but 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.259
 mexico pulled back waiting for holland 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.659
 the last 15 minutes Mexico was very 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.430
 compacted in a court room and that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 yes allow it to a team like 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.780
 walk these do not forgive and how was it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 expected and what always suffer 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 selection the first goal of holland 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 happened in ball stopped in a shot of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 corner in which volley sneijder 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 tied the game and we all think in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 that moment we were going to times 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.330
 extras but the curse of the eighths 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 he did his thing and with a bad penalty 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.470
 marked against mexico holland it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.910
 put in front no one expected it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 mexico- that I had the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.960
 classification in the hands but two 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 carelessness may end in two goals 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.300
 to finish with the Mexican dream this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 It has already become a curse since 1994 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.259
 To date Mexico has not been able 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
 qualify to the quarterfinals because 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.220
 always stays in eighths and this time 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 is the second one that defeats us in the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.660
 Mexico last moments so has 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 come to the same instance twice 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.550
 the same day in two separate worlds 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 16 years apart and both times 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.480
 repeated the same story the team 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.459
 tricolor begins the duel by playing with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.770
 category and personality in front of a 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.560
 superior rival in names in prestige 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.630
 in favoritism in the tournament 16 years ago 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 was Germany the team that was running 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.420
 manuel lapuente faced Europeans 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.700
 in mont 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.650
 on the French coast after having 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 past a tough first phase in which 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 draws against holland and belgium and a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 victory in front of South Korea put them 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.630
 in the second phase and to the surprise of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.910
 world that took for granted the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.920
 easy win from germany mexico played 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 with temper and got ahead in the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.000
 score with a goal work of the fight that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.010
 characterized the matador luís hernández 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.020
 he fought a ball until he went to 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.239
 give to the bottom of the network the Germans do not 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.310
 they gave credit they were losing the game 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.260
 and they did not have enough arrival to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.350
 think that they could easily give the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.510
 return to the scoreboard even the 2-0 will 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.340
 poked twice one starts the own 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.110
 matador and another in a kid shot 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.209
 arellano that lothar matthaeus deflected 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.610
 providentially for your team but 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.799
 Mexico ended back with the intention of 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 defend the scoreboard or maybe he threw them 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.730
 towards his arc the Teutonic impetus that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 He ended up turning the marker 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.170
 a few minutes when the match 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.239
 was already approaching the end the truth is that 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.459
 that day from the press box of the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.680
 stadium the feeling of defeat had to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.959
 Long time hovering though mexico still 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.730
 was up on the scoreboard this time it was 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.140
 crueler so much that we did not even 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.030
 we realized in the middle 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.130
 the fervor at what time he backed out 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.020
 Miguel Herrera was evident that when 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.000
 took out giovanni two saints gave 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.010
 instructions to javier aquino that he 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.260
 I got to defend behind left alone 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.819
 forward for a hypothetical backlash 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.560
 first to peralta and then to 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.480
 chicharito hernández but we had to 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.160
 suspect what when holland took the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.650
 ball and took it so many times to the front 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.570
 and so many times that the result should have 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.190
 seem imminent like that time in 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.380
 montpellier but we were not 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.750
 excited believing that the team 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.720
 I kept believing and well the result was 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.480
 the same exactly 16 years later a 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.459
 June 29 the Mexican national team leaves 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.470
 the world cup when everyone made us dream 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.570
 in what would be in the quarterfinals that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.430
 you think diego tell me about the others 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.109
 times that Mexico has been eliminated in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.900
 this phase is the team mexico 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.180
 faced the Netherlands where he lost 2-1 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.190
 at the last minute every four years 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.930
 hopes the Mexican team breaks 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.180
 with the curse of eighth finals 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.630
 let's know a little more about this 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.110
 possible world myth in states 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.120
 united-1994 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.220
 the selection of Mexico went to eighths of 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.740
 final where he faced off against bulgaria 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.110
 it was a pretty close match for 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.500
 and they came to penalties where the selection 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.360
 Mexican was out of the world in 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.190
 France-1998 Mexico faced off against 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.680
 germany in the round of 16 but 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.530
 They lost 2-1 World Cup in Korea 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.710
 south-2002 Mexico faced the US 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.889
 where he lost 2-0 and scored another painful 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.220
 duel for Mexicans world in 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.380
 germany-2006 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.419
 the tri faced Argentina was 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.970
 a dramatic encounter since he was very 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.120
 however, the Mexican national team 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.639
 he lost 2-1 with a world maxi goal 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.710
 In South Africa-2010 the team returned to 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.630
 face Argentina this time 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.990
 they showed that the party would not be so 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.180
 Easy Argentina beat Mexico 3-1 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.250
 honestly this time it was the occasion in 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.400
 that Mexico had fewer opportunities 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.470
 World of Brazil-2014 the curse for 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.780
 Mexico is still standing for six 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.449
 consecutive internationals this time mexico 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.490
 he lost 2-1 as you will see mexico has never 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.770
 got two goals in the round of 16 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.539
 he has always scored a goal or none 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.729
 that when Mexico scored two goals in the 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.919
 eighths maybe there are hopes of 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.790
 break the curse that seems to this 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.130
 damn 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.290
 of the end the truth is that this is already 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.080
 it becomes worrisome enough irritating 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.220
 I'm sick of this in addition to German 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.440
 the same thing happened 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.110
 Mexico was careless and did not go to the front and 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.880
 we already know the history in 94 should 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.890
 have a sorcerer who woke up this 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.710
 damn I can not believe it there's that 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.630
 take us some shamans for russia 2018 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.280
 to make us a clean this 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.680
 can continue there have to be changes 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.450
 in the league in the coaching staff have 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.250
 that work on basic forces and 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.020
 they need to give them a push in the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.090
 eighth finals in which insurance 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.220
 we will arrive in Russia and then lose 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.050
 in the eighths that's why we should be more 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.150
 attentive in that match and this 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.800
 opportunity was invaluable because if 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.870
 mexico would have won to holland 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.640
 I would have played against Costa Rica and the 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.980
 story against the Ticos was going to weigh 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.870
 remarkably in addition and mexico was capable 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.940
 of beating Holland because I could not 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.860
 win to costa rica after having 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.690
 won at costa rica would be among the 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.060
 four best teams in the world 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.070
 Imagine at least a fourth place 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.020
 that's why I say that this time it was a 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.150
 very important opportunity to do 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.340
 something in the world but unfortunately 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.840
 the curse was made good present 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.389
 these have been some before 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.100
 like it if you like it and if not also 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.100
 so there are us glasses
