00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.009

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.339
 And the district court 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.239

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.250
 How to use 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.940
 By the Olympics 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 It's about to rise above 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.620
 Than etv body 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 Naturally the talk is a breath away 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 We need big care with foot firmly on the gate burden 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.630
 To use the climbing shoes efficiently 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.090
 Pull up 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.590
 Lender or body 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.680
 In that way it climbs 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 Won 8th place in that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.710
 Okinawa's 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.420
 Or it's on the side of an artificial pond Soulful place 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 How do you see your feet 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 What is especially likely to be a beginner 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.160
 I'm wearing cramped shoes 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.730
 Because my feet hurt 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.170
 It is ideal to stand on your toes 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.560
 I absolutely buy 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 I am as illustrated 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.780
 First reverse on the board 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 And then 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520
 Body is 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.540
 There is no conglomerate 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 The balance is bad when you put out your next move 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.630
 For example with the toe 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.270
 This much 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 1 earns diarrhea 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.280
 If it seems like this 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 This is only painful Shimaoka Tatsuzo 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 Basically 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.079
 Toe 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.699
 This insight 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.149
 outside 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.149
 Around here 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.329
 Built with toes 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.559
 What direction 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.769
 And later 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 Be flexible 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.359
 Can be free 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.109
 When it comes to becoming 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.669
 I say Iruguku 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.199
 I grabbed my heel 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
 You can push your body 4 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 The high price of the country toe is also 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 Be shaken-by adopting 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.379
 In this way 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.189
 Climbing shoes- 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.639
 Necessary part 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.639
 Unnecessary part 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.349
 At footwork 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.709
 Strength 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.399
 If you make it spill 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.819
 Climbing is 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.549
 When you get better
