00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so again just to rear today what we're

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.590 
so again just to rear today what we're
doing<00:00:02.460> here<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.639> we're<00:00:02.760> kind<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:02.970> warping

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
doing here is we're kind of warping

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.660 
doing here is we're kind of warping
inside<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.470> glass<00:00:04.650> globe<00:00:05.100> which<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.490> an

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
inside that glass globe which is an

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.299 
inside that glass globe which is an
artificial<00:00:06.359> level<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:06.990> log<00:00:07.200> has<00:00:07.379> created<00:00:07.620> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
artificial level that log has created to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.959 
artificial level that log has created to
challenge<00:00:08.700> banjo<00:00:10.340> from<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.429> sort<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> artistic

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
challenge banjo from a sort of artistic

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
challenge banjo from a sort of artistic
point<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.360> view<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.630> kind<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> quite<00:00:13.710> enjoyed

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
point of view we kind of quite enjoyed

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.410 
point of view we kind of quite enjoyed
building<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:14.610> worlds<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.089> was<00:00:15.179> quite<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
building these worlds it was quite a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.359 
building these worlds it was quite a
good<00:00:15.599> opportunity<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.320> make<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.130> maybe

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
good opportunity to make it look maybe

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.790 
good opportunity to make it look maybe
different<00:00:17.609> mother<00:00:17.970> games<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.650> they<00:00:19.650> are

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
different mother games you know they are

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.439 
different mother games you know they are
artificial<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.760> where<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> would

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
artificial and so where you would

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
artificial and so where you would
generally<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.170> organic<00:00:22.529> materials

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
generally have like organic materials

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.189 
generally have like organic materials
we've<00:00:23.430> kind<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.730> turned<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.779> his<00:00:24.900> head<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
we've kind of turned on his head and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.080 
we've kind of turned on his head and
they<00:00:25.289> made<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.920> patchwork<00:00:26.160> fabrics

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
they made up of like patchwork fabrics

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.740 
they made up of like patchwork fabrics
and<00:00:27.300> metals<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.630> going

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and metals and so on so I'm just going

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
and metals and so on so I'm just going
to<00:00:30.810> quickly<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.650> wants<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to quickly do here is that wants you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.110 
to quickly do here is that wants you
inside<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.309> game<00:00:32.579> world<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.000> actually

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
inside a game world you can actually

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
inside a game world you can actually
pick<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.870> vehicle<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.500> your

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
pick and your vehicle out of your

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.430 
pick and your vehicle out of your
library<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:36.030> order<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.870> around<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
library in order just to get around so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500 
library in order just to get around so
because<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.040> quite<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> big<00:00:38.489> level<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
because it's quite a big level and I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
because it's quite a big level and I
just<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> show<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> level<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just want to show you the level off a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
just want to show you the level off a
little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.239> into

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
little bit so I'm just going to go into

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
little bit so I'm just going to go into
the<00:00:42.510> vehicle<00:00:42.690> database<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.469> loads<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> them

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the vehicle database and loads and them

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.750 
the vehicle database and loads and them
so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> loaded<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.300> vehicle<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so I loaded a vehicle in this is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
so I loaded a vehicle in this is
actually<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> blueprints<00:00:48.750> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
actually one of the blueprints that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
actually one of the blueprints that
humber's<00:00:49.230> given<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.000> build<00:00:51.449> your

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
humber's given me so you can build your

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.529 
humber's given me so you can build your
own<00:00:51.719> vehicles<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> any<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.920> any<00:00:53.039> challenge<00:00:53.539> or

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
own vehicles in any in any challenge or

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
own vehicles in any in any challenge or
you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:55.469> groupings<00:00:56.010> have

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you can actually use groupings have

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
you can actually use groupings have
provided<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> game<00:00:57.180> maybe<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.600> younger

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
provided by the game maybe for younger

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.880 
provided by the game maybe for younger
players<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.230> people<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.710> too

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
players or people that are too

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.810 
players or people that are too
interested<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.809> building<00:01:00.809> their<00:01:01.050> own<00:01:01.140> thing

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
interested in building their own thing

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.200 
interested in building their own thing
this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.329> simple<00:01:03.539> vehicle<00:01:05.210> it's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this is just a very simple vehicle it's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550 
this is just a very simple vehicle it's
just<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> allow<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> go<00:01:07.170> around<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
just going to allow me to go around the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.399 
just going to allow me to go around the
little<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.159> found<00:01:08.369> interesting<00:01:09.409> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
little what we found interesting the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.730 
little what we found interesting the
enemies<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.130> positive<00:01:11.700> seeing<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
enemies with positive seeing that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.840 
enemies with positive seeing that
ultimately<00:01:13.670> all<00:01:13.729> people<00:01:14.420> end<00:01:14.720> up<00:01:15.850> building

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
ultimately all people end up building

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.030 
ultimately all people end up building
and<00:01:19.180> it's<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.840> variations<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.770> state<00:01:22.009> of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
and it's the variations of the state of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.880 
and it's the variations of the state of
the<00:01:22.250> doing<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.960> first<00:01:24.200> stage<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.799> you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the doing the first stage is that you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.380 
the doing the first stage is that you
can<00:01:25.070> just<00:01:25.189> simply<00:01:25.520> use<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.700> vehicles<00:01:26.240> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
can just simply use the vehicles that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.090 
can just simply use the vehicles that
you'd<00:01:26.539> be<00:01:27.100> given<00:01:28.100> snails<00:01:28.369> doing<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:30.100> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
you'd be given snails doing here and the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.740 
you'd be given snails doing here and the
full<00:01:31.430> stages<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.179> can<00:01:32.330> build<00:01:32.539> things

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
full stages you can build things

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.960 
full stages you can build things
actually<00:01:33.049> be<00:01:33.380> anything<00:01:33.649> from<00:01:33.920> scratch<00:01:34.369> and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
actually be anything from scratch and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.240 
actually be anything from scratch and
that<00:01:35.149> gives<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.450> people<00:01:35.630> an<00:01:36.080> enormous<00:01:36.710> amount

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
that gives the people an enormous amount

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340 
that gives the people an enormous amount
of<00:01:37.539> possibility<00:01:38.539> as<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:38.899> see<00:01:39.110> then

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
of possibility as you can see then

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.109 
of possibility as you can see then

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.730 
intermediate stage though is to then
start<00:01:46.759> modifying<00:01:47.270> vehicles<00:01:48.080> in<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.289> do<00:01:48.470> yoga

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
start modifying vehicles in you do yoga

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.010 
start modifying vehicles in you do yoga
and<00:01:49.159> that's<00:01:49.670> among<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> people<00:01:50.360> general<00:01:50.780> star

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and that's among the people general star

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.289 
and that's among the people general star
track<00:01:51.319> so<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.280> know<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.549> tables<00:01:52.940> vehicle

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
track so you know the tables vehicle

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.570 
track so you know the tables vehicle
here<00:01:53.479> start<00:01:53.899> adding<00:01:54.110> extra<00:01:54.709> capabilities<00:01:55.369> to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
here start adding extra capabilities to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.130 
here start adding extra capabilities to
it<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.569> will<00:01:56.630> give<00:01:56.690> them<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.959> different

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
it and that will give them a different

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.840 
it and that will give them a different
way<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.470> approaching<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.250> same<00:01:58.429> challenge

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
way of approaching the same challenge

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.230 
way of approaching the same challenge
and<00:01:59.479> that's<00:01:59.630> what<00:01:59.750> we<00:01:59.869> found<00:02:00.080> about<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
and that's what we found about the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.220 
and that's what we found about the
longevity<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.319> getting<00:02:03.649> in<00:02:03.830> there

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.580 

the<00:02:06.770> creativity<00:02:07.730> of<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.060> player<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:09.440> how

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the creativity of the player is in how

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.110 
the creativity of the player is in how
they<00:02:09.770> approach<00:02:09.980> the<00:02:10.250> challenge<00:02:10.700> rather<00:02:10.910> than

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
they approach the challenge rather than

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.000 
they approach the challenge rather than
that<00:02:11.300> I'm<00:02:11.480> faster<00:02:12.050> or<00:02:13.450> stronger<00:02:14.450> etc<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.890> on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that I'm faster or stronger etc so on

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.980 
that I'm faster or stronger etc so on
the<00:02:19.160> game<00:02:19.370> world<00:02:19.640> we<00:02:20.450> basically<00:02:20.720> have

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
the game world we basically have

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.130 
the game world we basically have
familiar<00:02:21.830> characters<00:02:22.570> actually<00:02:23.570> post<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
familiar characters actually post the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.630 
familiar characters actually post the
challenges<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.980> can<00:02:25.130> see<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.400> map

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
challenges and you can see all the map

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.820 
challenges and you can see all the map
the<00:02:26.180> tickets<00:02:26.540> around<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.020> level<00:02:27.260> indicate

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the tickets around the level indicate

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.920 
the tickets around the level indicate
where<00:02:28.010> they<00:02:28.160> are<00:02:28.280> by<00:02:29.210> going<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.690> talking

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
where they are by going up and talking

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.900 
where they are by going up and talking
to<00:02:30.200> them<00:02:30.290> they<00:02:30.440> will<00:02:30.500> offer<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.830> challenge<00:02:31.190> in

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
to them they will offer a challenge in

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.600 
to them they will offer a challenge in
which<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.240> can<00:02:32.390> compare<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> FG<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:34.220> just

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
which you can compare to the FG I'm just

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.340 
which you can compare to the FG I'm just
going<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.790> show<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> challenge<00:02:35.600> it's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
going to show you this challenge it's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:47.450 
going to show you this challenge it's
called<00:02:36.470> intergalactic<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.490> them

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.370 

basically<00:02:48.330> challenge<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.720> quite<00:02:48.930> simple<00:02:49.230> with

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
basically challenge is quite simple with

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.400 
basically challenge is quite simple with
some<00:02:49.620> arm<00:02:50.210> there's<00:02:51.210> some<00:02:51.360> space<00:02:51.630> job<00:02:51.930> has<00:02:52.140> been

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
some arm there's some space job has been

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
some arm there's some space job has been
left<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> level<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.670> humpers<00:02:53.970> asking<00:02:54.270> us

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
left on on a level and humpers asking us

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.220 
left on on a level and humpers asking us
to<00:02:54.570> buy<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:55.170> bit<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.760> polluting<00:02:56.760> level

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
to buy a little bit for polluting level

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.930 
to buy a little bit for polluting level
so<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.470> actually<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:59.450> hatch<00:03:01.940> supposing

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
so it's actually a hatch supposing

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.240 
so it's actually a hatch supposing
siblings<00:03:03.420> transport<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.170> job<00:03:04.620> into<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> Hat

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
siblings transport this job into the Hat

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.820 
siblings transport this job into the Hat
again<00:03:06.240> like<00:03:06.450> Mark<00:03:06.690> said<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.380> trying<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> do

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
again like Mark said what trying to do

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.680 
again like Mark said what trying to do
is<00:03:07.980> give<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.550> quail<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.240> simple

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
is give the quail very simple

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.430 
is give the quail very simple
challenging<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.230> open<00:03:10.560> up<00:03:10.680> how<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
challenging but open up how you do that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.590 
challenging but open up how you do that
cleanly<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> player<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.610> everyone<00:03:15.480> would

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
cleanly to the player so everyone would

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.250 
cleanly to the player so everyone would
really<00:03:15.870> go<00:03:15.990> back<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.440> different<00:03:16.740> manner<00:03:18.260> so

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
really go back in a different manner so

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.870 
really go back in a different manner so
what<00:03:19.380> I'm<00:03:19.470> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:19.920> basically<00:03:20.130> i<00:03:20.550> was

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
what I'm going to do is basically i was

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.700 
what I'm going to do is basically i was
playing<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.300> few<00:03:21.510> days<00:03:21.570> ago<00:03:21.720> in

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
playing this a few days ago in

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.050 
playing this a few days ago in
preparation<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.460> demo<00:03:23.670> i'm<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.940> going

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
preparation for the demo i'm just going

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.150 
preparation for the demo i'm just going
to<00:03:24.090> run<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.300> through<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.650> almost<00:03:25.950> my

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
to run you through some of I almost my

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.190 
to run you through some of I almost my
thought<00:03:26.580> process<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.120> how<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.330> personally

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
thought process of how I personally

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.780 
thought process of how I personally
tackled<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.710> it's<00:03:29.100> not<00:03:29.190> necessary<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.610> say

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
tackled it it's not necessary to say

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.390 
tackled it it's not necessary to say
this<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.120> best<00:03:30.300> way<00:03:30.720> leavin<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
this is the best way leavin a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.320 
this is the best way leavin a
particularly<00:03:32.400> great<00:03:32.580> lived<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.180> it's

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
particularly great lived and if it's

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.790 
particularly great lived and if it's
just<00:03:33.540> how<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> opposed<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> show<00:03:34.740> you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
just how I opposed it and to show you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.460 
just how I opposed it and to show you
the<00:03:35.340> sort<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.610> process<00:03:35.850> behind<00:03:36.240> I<00:03:37.130> didn't<00:03:39.470> so

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
the sort of process behind I didn't so

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.630 
the sort of process behind I didn't so
the<00:03:40.800> first<00:03:41.010> method<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.640> use<00:03:41.910> was<00:03:42.210> um<00:03:42.390> I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
the first method I use was um I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.310 
the first method I use was um I
basically<00:03:44.640> built<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:44.970> great<00:03:45.270> big<00:03:45.600> kind<00:03:46.260> of

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
basically built this great big kind of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.050 
basically built this great big kind of
bulldozer<00:03:46.770> type<00:03:47.130> thing<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.520> thought<00:03:47.880> well

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
bulldozer type thing and thought well

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060 
bulldozer type thing and thought well
it's<00:03:48.360> kind<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.720> big<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.050> heavy<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.530> powerful

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
it's kind of big and heavy and powerful

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.920 
it's kind of big and heavy and powerful
and<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.460> was<00:03:50.610> trying<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> push<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.210> junk<00:03:51.540> into

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and I was trying to push this junk into
