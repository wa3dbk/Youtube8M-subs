because it draws the eye more and so you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.700 
because it draws the eye more and so you
just<00:01:16.619> basically<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> base

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
is not going to be even

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.400 
is not going to be even
you<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.420> mean<00:02:14.230> tight<00:02:14.890> across<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> let<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.840> hang

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you I mean tight across so I let it hang

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.680 
you I mean tight across so I let it hang
a<00:02:17.560> little<00:02:17.680> bit<00:02:17.890> loose<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:19.000> enough<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.510> where

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
a little bit loose just enough to where

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.130 
a little bit loose just enough to where

placed it in my scanner and then I just
enlarged<00:04:19.840> on<00:04:20.200> my<00:04:20.410> computer<00:04:21.270> because<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.479> didn't

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
enlarged on my computer because I didn't

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.280 
enlarged on my computer because I didn't
have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> die<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.440> have<00:04:23.680> two<00:04:24.490> bird<00:04:25.180> dies<00:04:25.450> from<00:04:25.810> sis

have a die I have two bird dies from sis

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.100 
have a die I have two bird dies from sis
but<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.830> wasn't<00:04:26.980> big<00:04:27.310> enough<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:28.570> where<00:04:28.780> it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
but it wasn't big enough to where it

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.720 
but it wasn't big enough to where it
would<00:04:29.230> fit<00:04:29.440> in<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.620> cage<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:30.250> was<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.550> too

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
would fit in the cage it was just too

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.060 
would fit in the cage it was just too

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
just took the design paper and me it's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.830 
just took the design paper and me it's
from<00:06:35.919> quick<00:06:36.160> cuts<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.669> file

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
from quick cuts the file

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.260 
from quick cuts the file
and<00:06:37.960> then<00:06:38.230> i<00:06:38.530> just<00:06:38.590> added<00:06:38.949> a<00:06:39.130> dash<00:06:39.310> ticket<00:06:39.880> and

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
and then i just added a dash ticket and

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.200 
and then i just added a dash ticket and
then<00:06:40.660> it<00:06:40.780> just<00:06:40.810> opens<00:06:41.260> like<00:06:41.410> that<00:06:41.650> and<00:06:42.280> then

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
then it just opens like that and then

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.840 
then it just opens like that and then
create<00:06:43.540> a<00:06:43.570> flower<00:06:43.930> I<00:06:44.230> kept<00:06:44.830> it<00:06:45.070> pretty<00:06:45.490> simple

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
create a flower I kept it pretty simple

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.600 
create a flower I kept it pretty simple
because<00:06:46.210> I<00:06:46.870> didn't<00:06:47.440> want<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:48.100> may<00:06:48.220> need<00:06:48.370> to<00:06:48.490> be

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
because I didn't want the may need to be

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.659 
because I didn't want the may need to be
too<00:06:48.850> heavy<00:06:49.290> because<00:06:50.290> again<00:06:51.070> it's<00:06:51.220> only<00:06:51.490> being

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
too heavy because again it's only being

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.629 
too heavy because again it's only being
held<00:06:51.970> by<00:06:52.240> the<00:06:52.300> karmic<00:06:52.900> pan<00:06:53.169> and<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:54.310> ornate

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
held by the karmic pan and the ornate

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.120 
held by the karmic pan and the ornate
played<00:06:54.940> itself<00:06:55.600> already<00:06:55.870> is<00:06:56.139> heavy<00:06:56.380> so<00:06:56.680> I

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
played itself already is heavy so I
