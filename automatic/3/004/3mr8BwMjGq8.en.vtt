the reason that you want to save images

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
the reason that you want to save images
for<00:00:21.449> web<00:00:21.660> instead<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.769> file

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
for web instead of just going to file

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
for web instead of just going to file
save<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> photoshop<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.449> you're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.410> to

save and photoshop if you're going to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.349 
save and photoshop if you're going to
upload<00:00:25.769> them<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> Internet<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.880> simply

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
upload them to the Internet is simply

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
upload them to the Internet is simply
file<00:00:27.630> size<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.900> smaller<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> file<00:00:31.590> size

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
file size and the smaller the file size

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
file size and the smaller the file size
the<00:00:32.099> quicker<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.579> web<00:00:32.820> page<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.210> load<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the quicker the web page will load of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
the quicker the web page will load of
course<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.100> big<00:00:35.280> concern<00:00:35.430> especially

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
course so it's a big concern especially

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.819 
course so it's a big concern especially

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
here in preset I'm going to choose PNG 8

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.679 
here in preset I'm going to choose PNG 8
now<00:02:25.189> this<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.579> smallest<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.359> save<00:02:26.569> it

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
now this is the smallest way to save it

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.190 
now this is the smallest way to save it
as<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> PNG<00:02:27.049> file<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:28.549> may<00:02:28.760> want<00:02:28.969> to<00:02:29.120> choose<00:02:29.540> PNG

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
as a PNG file you may want to choose PNG

as a PNG file you may want to choose PNG

24 if the the PNG eight books looks a

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.869 
24 if the the PNG eight books looks a
little<00:02:34.970> simplified<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:36.500> here

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
little simplified because you see here

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.280 
little simplified because you see here
it<00:02:37.879> limits<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.359> amount<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.689> colors<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.140> can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it limits the amount of colors that can

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.110 
it limits the amount of colors that can
be<00:02:39.439> used<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:41.209> PNG<00:02:41.629> 24<00:02:42.109> does<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.639> so<00:02:43.639> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
be used and the PNG 24 does not so the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.520 
be used and the PNG 24 does not so the
eights<00:02:44.269> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.569> result<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.079> lot<00:02:45.230> smaller

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
eights going to result in a lot smaller

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.339 
eights going to result in a lot smaller
file<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.299> most<00:02:47.420> cases<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.139> going<00:02:48.290> to

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
file so in most cases this is going to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.020 
file so in most cases this is going to
be<00:02:48.470> what<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.709> want<00:02:48.859> to<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.549> it's<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
be what you want to do but if it's a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.449 
be what you want to do but if it's a
limiting<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> file<00:02:51.079> too<00:02:51.290> much<00:02:51.470> try<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.859> PNG

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
limiting the file too much try the PNG

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.759 
limiting the file too much try the PNG
24<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.120> see<00:02:53.209> how<00:02:53.329> that<00:02:53.389> looks<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.650> obviously

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
24 and see how that looks but obviously

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.039 
24 and see how that looks but obviously
this<00:02:55.129> looks<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:55.579> fine<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.819> me<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.930> I'm<00:02:57.019> going

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
this looks just fine to me so I'm going

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.199 
this looks just fine to me so I'm going

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
this as logo away now i'll close this

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940 
this as logo away now i'll close this
and<00:03:07.159> i<00:03:07.430> want<00:03:07.609> to<00:03:07.669> see<00:03:07.849> how<00:03:08.379> drastic<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.530> file

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.039 
and i want to see how drastic the file
