00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.340
 In 1994, two siblings become brutal 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.509
 murdered in a summerhouse at the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.009
 coast found 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.619
 the suspicion falls on a group 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.029
 students from a nearby 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.010
 elite boarding for their violence orgies 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.390
 are known 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.519
 but then someone else confesses the act 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.699
 and the case is placed on the files 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.019
 to carl remember 20 years later of one 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.750
 apparently confused man on open 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.239
 street is addressed 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 he pretends to be the father of the victims and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.580
 will be found dead the next day 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 Something about the thing is not right and 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.960
 so go with his assistant 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.790
 Assad on the trail of murders in the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 archives come across the panic 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.180
 Emergency call of a young woman with the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.780
 crime to communicate 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.010
 kimi seems to be the key 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 to be the solution 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.000
 she has been without a trace since then 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.070
 disappeared and already are 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.119
 karl and assad in the midst of a breathless 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.010
 hunt for her 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.960
 not just in the abyss of 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.909
 society is but also in one 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.829
 the highest circles for teams 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.320
 Revelations were a big danger for 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.119
 a series of influential men and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.070
 they do everything to make sure they stay forever 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.679
 keep silent and continue with karl marx 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.840
 and his assistant assad 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.210
 the mercy finally comes the long 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.390
 Expected second part in the cinemas 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.969
 desecration he starts where the first 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.249
 Part ends and is at least the same 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.659
 exciting 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.700
 This will give you the two hours 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.299
 the film has a pretty short duration 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.350
 which is a pretty good sign 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.659
 At first the story is still something 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.189
 become confused by some reviews 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.689
 the action, however, always clearer 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.310
 in between for the tension 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.079
 but always relaxed 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.609
 otherwise you could probably do that at all 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.159
 No one can stand in a cinema chair 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.020
 that's what assad is for me 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.310
 really often surprised me with 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.410
 his skills 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.260
 for all scandinavia krimifans is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.330
 this film has to be a who already in the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.920
 first part should like this one 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.319
 Watch the movie in any case 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.440
 this is six out of eight points 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.989
 film in any case worth watching 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.970
 brings us nfp on january 15 in the 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.150
 German cinemas and is from 16 years 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.150
 Approved 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.100
 There are days when I think I will 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.970
 now just interject something pills 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
 so that is over 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.750
 but I do not do it 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.520
 your drink 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 what do you know about internates you send 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.030
 his children if you do not feel like it 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.400
 to be with him 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.940
 chemistry let her be one of the first 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 koffers 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.190
 and if she is already dead or 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.110
 married is a difference 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.870
 We believe that there are students from the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.170
 internet griffen horn track i want you 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.660
 Help as guilty as the other 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 chemistry has tried the truth is so 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.550
 came far 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.550
 how can I be asked to come along 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.060
 the only thing that matters to me is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.060
 that you will get your life back
