00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
particular game will go I think very is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.509 
particular game will go I think very is
more<00:00:48.600> hungry<00:00:48.900> than<00:00:49.049> ever<00:00:49.379> after<00:00:49.830> saying<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
more hungry than ever after saying that

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.030

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
we lost install other I think to stay an

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100 
we lost install other I think to stay an
opportunity<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.879> rose<00:00:54.089> which<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.869> think

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
opportunity we know rose which I think

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
opportunity we know rose which I think
everyone<00:00:55.440> does<00:00:55.589> now<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.210> saying<00:00:57.479> like

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
fault and I think that's good for a
scene<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.790> think<00:01:02.970> it's<00:01:03.089> good<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.269> ourself<00:01:03.750> as

will<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.750> able<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.260> beat<00:02:19.440> them<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.890> net<00:02:20.100> two

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
will be able to beat them to net two

will be able to beat them to net two
maps<00:02:20.550> 20<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.390> did<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.660> copenhagen<00:02:22.170> games

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

can play our own game and win that's
that's<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.610> only<00:02:29.820> thing<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.209> matter<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.600> me

that's the only thing that matter for me
it<00:02:31.260> doesn't<00:02:31.530> matter<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:31.709> 21<00:02:32.160> or<00:02:32.459> 20<00:02:33.270> if<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:34.140> ask

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it doesn't matter if 21 or 20 if we ask

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.540 
it doesn't matter if 21 or 20 if we ask

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
others teams that you had faced it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.199 
others teams that you had faced it
before<00:02:53.940> hadn't<00:02:54.840> done<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.430> don't<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.580> mean<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
before hadn't done I don't know I mean I

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.310 
before hadn't done I don't know I mean I
shouldn't<00:02:57.420> give<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.810> information

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
shouldn't give out that information

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.949 
shouldn't give out that information
because<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.580> know<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.180> would<00:03:00.360> you

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
because if we know that we would you

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.960 
because if we know that we would you
know<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.230> saying<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:01.860> they've<00:03:02.850> been

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
know not saying it but they've been

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.550 
know not saying it but they've been
playing<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.420> much<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.959> built<00:03:04.170> camping<00:03:04.470> all

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
playing so much to be built camping all

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.750 
playing so much to be built camping all
the<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.160> every<00:03:05.340> time<00:03:05.519> they've<00:03:05.730> been

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the time for every time they've been

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.660 
the time for every time they've been
playing<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.560> they'd<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.280> jumping

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
playing for and they'd be jumping

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
playing for and they'd be jumping
directly<00:03:08.760> off<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.060> form<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> boot<00:03:09.660> camp

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
directly off the form of the boot camp

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.930 
directly off the form of the boot camp
and<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.470> think<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.800> gives<00:03:10.950> advantage<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.790> them

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
and I think that gives advantage to them

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.790 
and I think that gives advantage to them
because<00:03:12.150> they're<00:03:12.420> playing<00:03:12.600> all<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> time<00:03:13.170> no

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
because they're playing all the time no

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.990 
because they're playing all the time no
no<00:03:14.100> sleep<00:03:14.420> arrests<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.570> say<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.250> we're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
no sleep arrests of say but like we're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.580 
no sleep arrests of say but like we're
playing<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.330> shirt<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.720> much<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.260> they've<00:03:19.470> been

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
playing a shirt so much and they've been

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.949 
playing a shirt so much and they've been
comical<00:03:19.890> circles<00:03:20.459> each<00:03:20.610> time<00:03:20.959> eventually

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
comical circles each time eventually

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.030 
comical circles each time eventually
you're<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> lose<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.620> doesn't<00:03:22.920> matter

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
you're going to lose it doesn't matter

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.160 
you're going to lose it doesn't matter
if<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.340> win<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.910> four<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.540> row<00:03:24.690> you're

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
if you win like four in a row you're

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.720 
if you win like four in a row you're
going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.350> lose<00:03:25.440> some<00:03:25.739> time<00:03:25.980> so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
going to lose some time so

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.759 
going to lose some time so
I<00:03:26.819> just<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.810> they<00:03:27.989> had<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.140> good<00:03:28.319> day<00:03:28.500> we
