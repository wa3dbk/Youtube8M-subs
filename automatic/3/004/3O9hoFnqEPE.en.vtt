00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.299
 then speedo i play such a line 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 Real Madrid also played in Russia and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.540
 greece and italy poland today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.740
 present at international Belgium as 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 online alley 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 greece beautiful victory our lions what the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 politicians especially 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.740
 noticed today I especially think you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 saw that there was already a team that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 there was a very high intensity there 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 everyone is prepared 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 to go through the fire for each other and then 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 will be nice to see and even though this 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 expected so early in the campaign 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.399
 you still don't think so many copies 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.100
 is going to be and then you see that they are 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 huge already have fun 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.860
 by defending because they know too 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 but also in Greece has more 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 talent but you see that is really one 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 very good whole was two years ago 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 were we 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.820
 90 in europe we may aspire to be top 8 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 this Belgo mine some colors that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 is also added to the preliminary week I think 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.590
 the match there must match 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.809
 the julia group is feasible on paper 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 but that there are no gifts so me 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.570
 think at there really what sector she became 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 must think and really assume 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.530
 ambition must reach its second round and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 then we'll see 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 but not yet dreaming of top 8 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 on there is no point in it and very much 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.009
 good countries and everyone we do that top 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.360
 8 so get something like that one day 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.070
 energetic to speak of that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.610
 I think get second round and then see 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 we do 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.869
 then everything can be had today also quarrel 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 does get a small boost in it 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.020
 Belgium the minus 100 wind that had top 8 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.310
 we must be there we are doing well 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.409
 should we blew there 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.979
 continue to build in and we have 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.810
 huge future but I think we do 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 anyway or are reasonably insured 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.690
 it also later they were couples large 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 boys are popping up in the coming years 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.429
 the temporary are not favored 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.110
 physically in Belgium where we don't have very many 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.429
 tall people 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.899
 so i guess that's a bit in need 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.550
 but I think we can 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.990
 indeed have seen that has anyway 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.909
 shouting a lot of talent that we see 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 that also in recent years now in the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.909
 Belgian competition where players 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.979
 actually have to play since the six 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.080
 Belgian rule and that people are sitting 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.000
 make enormous progress because they are allowed to play 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440
 I personally think team and the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.910
 national youth teams that he 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.590
 benefit from it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.590
 ok thomas thanks and see you next
