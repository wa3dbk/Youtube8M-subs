going to talk about what I did I
actually<00:01:09.680> recorded<00:01:10.430> all<00:01:10.790> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.330> MIDI<00:01:11.600> data

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
actually recorded all of the MIDI data

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.290 
actually recorded all of the MIDI data
on<00:01:12.200> two<00:01:12.740> audio<00:01:13.220> tracks<00:01:13.280> as<00:01:13.850> well

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
on two audio tracks as well

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.719 
on two audio tracks as well
and<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.170> way<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.680> was<00:01:15.800> done<00:01:16.070> as<00:01:16.610> you

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
and the way that that was done as you

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.490 
and the way that that was done as you
can<00:01:16.909> see<00:01:17.090> here<00:01:17.240> on<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.509> instrument<00:01:17.840> track<00:01:18.229> I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
can see here on this instrument track I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.840 
can see here on this instrument track I
set<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.890> output<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:20.060> buss<00:01:20.270> five<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:20.899> six

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
set the output to buss five and six

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.330 
set the output to buss five and six
right<00:01:22.850> here<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.300> then<00:01:24.080> set<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.590> input<00:01:24.800> of

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
right here and then set the input of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.779 
right here and then set the input of
this<00:01:25.789> audio<00:01:26.240> track<00:01:26.660> to<00:01:26.960> receive<00:01:27.500> plus<00:01:28.399> five

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
this audio track to receive plus five

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.770 
this audio track to receive plus five
and<00:01:28.820> six<00:01:30.160> if<00:01:31.160> you<00:01:31.340> record<00:01:31.789> enable<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.420> track

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
and six if you record enable this track

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.710 
and six if you record enable this track
and<00:01:33.039> playback<00:01:34.039> this<00:01:34.399> track<00:01:34.729> it'll<00:01:35.570> be

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
and playback this track it'll be

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.419 
and playback this track it'll be
recorded<00:01:36.350> as<00:01:36.530> audio<00:01:37.039> on<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.910> audio<00:01:38.149> track<00:01:39.429> so

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
recorded as audio on this audio track so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.880 
recorded as audio on this audio track so
next<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.850> each<00:01:41.030> instrument<00:01:42.020> track<00:01:42.289> there's<00:01:42.740> an

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
next to each instrument track there's an

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.460 
next to each instrument track there's an
audio<00:01:43.250> track<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:44.360> has<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.869> audio<00:01:45.200> version

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
audio track that has the audio version

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.710 
audio track that has the audio version
of<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.520> MIDI<00:01:46.729> data<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
of the MIDI data that's on the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.990 
of the MIDI data that's on the
instrument<00:01:48.200> track<00:01:48.410> now<00:01:49.190> why<00:01:49.429> do<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.640> do<00:01:49.729> this

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
instrument track now why do I do this

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.330 
instrument track now why do I do this
well<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.869> think<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.350> really<00:01:51.590> good<00:01:51.800> idea<00:01:51.950> to

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
well I think it's a really good idea to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.520 
well I think it's a really good idea to
record<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.850> audio<00:01:53.000> version<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.750> any<00:01:53.990> MIDI<00:01:54.350> or

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
record the audio version of any MIDI or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.410 
record the audio version of any MIDI or
instrument<00:01:55.070> track<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.939> always<00:01:56.119> have

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
instrument track so that you always have

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.870 
instrument track so that you always have
a<00:01:56.450> hard<00:01:56.750> copy<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.619> then<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.610> really

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a hard copy of it and then if you really

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.609 
a hard copy of it and then if you really
need<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.329> can<00:01:59.479> go<00:01:59.689> back<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.200> make<00:02:00.409> edits

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
need to you can go back and make edits

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.940 
need to you can go back and make edits
on<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.520> MIDI<00:02:01.729> or<00:02:02.000> instrument<00:02:02.720> track<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.259> then

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
on the MIDI or instrument track and then

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.999 
on the MIDI or instrument track and then
rerecord<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.820> audio<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.420> need<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.750> and

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
rerecord it as audio if you need to and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.160 
rerecord it as audio if you need to and
you<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.369> also<00:02:07.549> make<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.420> instrument<00:02:08.959> track

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
you can also make the instrument track

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.069 
you can also make the instrument track
inactive<00:02:09.979> if<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.759> go<00:02:10.940> down<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.780> little

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
inactive if you go down to the little

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.580 
inactive if you go down to the little
icon<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.310> track<00:02:13.610> type<00:02:13.910> icon<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.660> you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
icon here the track type icon and you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.280 
icon here the track type icon and you
right-click<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.640> say<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.510> inactive

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
right-click you can say make inactive

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.610 
right-click you can say make inactive
and<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:19.280> makes<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:19.700> entire<00:02:20.150> track

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and that makes this entire track

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.900 
and that makes this entire track
inactive<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.799> you're<00:02:22.070> saving<00:02:22.549> all<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
inactive and you're saving all the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.270 
inactive and you're saving all the
processing<00:02:23.540> power<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.650> was<00:02:24.799> going<00:02:25.100> into

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
processing power that was going into

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.430 
processing power that was going into
this<00:02:25.519> track<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.150> let<00:02:26.660> me<00:02:26.750> tell<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.019> virtual

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
this track and let me tell you virtual

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.410 
this track and let me tell you virtual
instruments<00:02:27.950> take<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.459> lot<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.850> processing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
instruments take up a lot of processing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.170 
instruments take up a lot of processing
power<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.769> particular<00:02:31.370> session<00:02:31.790> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
power so in this particular session I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.140 
power so in this particular session I
could<00:02:32.780> literally<00:02:33.049> go<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.709> make<00:02:34.280> all<00:02:34.549> of<00:02:34.610> these

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
could literally go and make all of these

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.590
