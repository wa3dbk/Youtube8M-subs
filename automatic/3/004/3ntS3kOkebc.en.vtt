00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.670 
liking to squeeze a little bit of lime
juice<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.329> then<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.599> like<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> sprinkle<00:03:14.079> on<00:03:14.409> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.050 
juice and then I like to sprinkle on a
whole<00:03:14.950> bunch<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.310> cayenne<00:03:15.670> pepper

the lime and cayenne pepper reminds me

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.580 
the lime and cayenne pepper reminds me
of<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:18.700> we<00:03:18.730> were<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.060> part<00:03:19.419> of<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.630> Arda<00:03:19.989> eating

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
of when we were in part of a Arda eating

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.069 
of when we were in part of a Arda eating
corn<00:03:20.889> on<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.040> cob<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.639> street<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.329> tastes

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
corn on the cob in the street it tastes

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.009 
corn on the cob in the street it tastes

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.790 
little bit healthier and a little bit
less<00:04:36.699> than<00:04:37.120> if<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.630> were<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.110> go<00:04:38.380> out<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
less than if I were to go out on the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.620 
less than if I were to go out on the
weekend<00:04:39.190> or<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.880> were<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.240> go<00:04:40.360> out<00:04:40.479> for

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
weekend or if I were to go out for

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.060 
weekend or if I were to go out for
dinner<00:04:40.780> with<00:04:40.900> my<00:04:41.199> friends<00:04:41.530> during<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.919> week

dinner with my friends during the week

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.750 
dinner with my friends during the week
and<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.639> so<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.840> probably<00:04:44.500> the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
and the like so this is probably the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.129 
and the like so this is probably the
fewest<00:04:45.760> amount<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:46.180> calories<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:46.900> will

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
fewest amount of calories that I will

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.230
