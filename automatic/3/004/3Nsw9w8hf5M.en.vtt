00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the two kids are her boyfriend and good 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.600
 we start in the world is clear and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.420
 good this video pointed out that the tsunami 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.750
 destroyed part of paute for 1.8 that the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 true you and the entire region 1.8 for 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.960
 that you prove that you do not oppose any 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 of the textures and now we're going to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.950
 start it by reducing the swords that the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.300
 you can see 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.300
 but I do not know enough 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.559
 and good but you know what we have for 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.559
 here 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.200
 he is pretty handsome I want especially 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.470
 the cane we love a lot of hd with 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.790
 chrysler but without going too much that hits 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.770
 quite with the rock with that is also 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.690
 white and then they kicked me out as you see 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.809
 a little bit injured but I think that 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 you can not appreciate anything and fire and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.090
 here you have the fish paragliding here 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.880
 we have breasts that take off quite 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.350
 and populate your easy life then here as 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.570
 these peaks and such have some 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.560
 very small differences 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.680
 then you make them around here but it's not so 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 A) Yes 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 with some little things like the food is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.020
 a little modified here not all 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
 for example they are there they are a little 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 modified also a little bit alone 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 almost nothing so there is not much 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.320
 difference this one has a pint of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.250
 migration as you can see here you can 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.840
 appreciate quite 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.840
 then the particles 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.140
 here we have particles I think we're 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.140
 studying 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 and then what more armor are here 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.020
 as you can see the armor looks pretty 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.610
 that is ramirez enclose equip it is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 so I think she 's pretty pretty 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.259
 maybe it's a little bit too much to be a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:14.290
 sport itd but we do not know if then what 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:19.780
 I'm sure he's going to kill us 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.819
 for this but good is enough 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 hi how is this makeup and I 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.240
 like here you have to achieve rap that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.300
 has changed and other brice would be lovely 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.920
 we directed the war to water 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.010
 transparent as it is evident to 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:45.620
 google is perfectly targeted 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:48.330
 perfectly and then obviously 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.490
 then as you can see clearly you have a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.610
 small animation that is almost not noticeable 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.510
 a lot but good is pretty pretty in 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.280
 the missals here 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 and I would say it's all inventories 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.250
 are those of huawei 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.250
 and such 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.790
 here you have it transparent food 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.590
 for the photo is going to look pretty 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.370
 cream let's see if this was a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.360
 Quick 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.360
 you have it 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.190
 this is the whole pack that prepare the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.579
 Truth has come to me quite currillo 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.549
 because to find textures that allow and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.349
 good is a power if you have and what 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.569
 you can download then there you have it and 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.190
 now that they are about to be going to 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.590
 power in that version I think for c's 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.959
 this style comes pretty well and nothing 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.450
 if you liked the pack ports we closed 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.450
 the dynatran cosmos days goodbye 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.740
 yes 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.740
 yes 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.010
 all right 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.010
 yes
