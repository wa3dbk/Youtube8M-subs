100% get on the console version for

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.869 
100% get on the console version for
example<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.770> will<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.039> white<00:02:10.280> because<00:02:10.640> this

but you can see what he looks like and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.980 
but you can see what he looks like and
for<00:02:42.640> example<00:02:42.700> say<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.300> wanted<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
for example say you wanted to have a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.310 
for example say you wanted to have a
yellow<00:02:44.290> helmet<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.130> black<00:02:45.790> chess<00:02:46.270> play<00:02:46.600> white

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
yellow helmet a black chess play white

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.309 
yellow helmet a black chess play white
legs<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.069> then<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.370> wanted<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:49.319> read

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
legs and then you wanted to have read

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.050 
legs and then you wanted to have read
booties<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.310> do<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.760> see

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
booties then you can do that you can see

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.910 
booties then you can do that you can see
how<00:02:52.209> different<00:02:52.239> they<00:02:52.720> are<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.680> think

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
how different they are and I just think

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.070 
how different they are and I just think
the<00:02:54.010> combinations<00:02:54.610> are<00:02:54.850> very<00:02:55.450> very<00:02:55.810> unique

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
the combinations are very very unique

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.170 
the combinations are very very unique
it's<00:02:56.500> very<00:02:56.769> very<00:02:56.980> incredible<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.820> fully

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
it's very very incredible and I do fully

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.270 
it's very very incredible and I do fully
enjoy<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.530> gonna<00:02:59.650> place<00:02:59.800> these<00:03:00.040> back

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
enjoy that so I'm gonna place these back

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.650 
enjoy that so I'm gonna place these back
in<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.580> chest<00:03:00.880> I'm<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> actually

we<00:05:04.450> might<00:05:04.570> not<00:05:04.720> get<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:04.990> these<00:05:05.170> because<00:05:05.530> we

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
we might not get all these because we

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.470 
we might not get all these because we
might<00:05:05.800> not<00:05:05.950> even<00:05:06.100> get<00:05:06.310> all<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.730> editions<00:05:07.240> of

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
might not even get all the editions of

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.150 
might not even get all the editions of
the<00:05:07.750> flowers<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.470> so<00:05:08.950> there's<00:05:09.100> a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
the flowers and so there's a

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.440 
the flowers and so there's a
hit-and-miss<00:05:09.550> like<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:09.940> said<00:05:10.090> that's<00:05:10.240> why<00:05:10.420> I

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
hit-and-miss like I said that's why I

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.060 
hit-and-miss like I said that's why I
haven't<00:05:10.690> really<00:05:10.930> used<00:05:10.960> them<00:05:11.350> in<00:05:11.470> this<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:11.950> for

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
haven't really used them in this but for

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.400 
haven't really used them in this but for
example<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.850> can<00:05:13.240> change<00:05:13.600> them<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:13.930> let's<00:05:14.260> say

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
example you can change them so let's say

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.800 
example you can change them so let's say
