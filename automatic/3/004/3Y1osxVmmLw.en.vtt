 right here 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.059

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.610
 years called the body so it is 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.050
 dci historia and offspring and games 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.670
 who are who are exclusively in 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.830
 French neck that are presented to and 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.070
 it's us or salty multilingual version 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.170
 we have a 100% French version 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 diagnosis what is the original publisher 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.410
 of historia worth it presented 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.520
 multilingual version on his stand 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.710
 no we really care about translation 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.460
 francophone is here we presented it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.840
 in 100 ok ok so today is 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.789
 compared to the blocks for him that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.470
 scenes and the return of the last 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.320
 years too I feel like it's 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 know what kind of game that interests there 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.610
 has one that mainly interests 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.570
 the people who come to see you in essen 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.649
 it sounds it's still a little 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.509
 particular because it's still 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.820
 people who know the game companies 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.140
 who are passionate about her so so a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.900
 historia 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.060
 is going to have its place and is really 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.380
 searched even though at the same time we see 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.400
 still more and more families 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.720
 and even the big players they also have 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.130
 want to bring their children and so 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.810
 they will want to play more 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.030
 little games the family flea games 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.770
 of atmosphere so finally our place to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 it is also justified even though our 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 specialty is not the big game of 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.700
 chord guides then in in the east 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.680
 in little games a little bit more 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.690
 family so here I give him the 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.260
 difference tutti frutti gloups ya 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.640
 panic the gossip is what they have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.830
 are addressed to different audiences they 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.380
 are in particular categories 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.590
 it is completed by the mechanism by the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.750
 way of playing or the audience finally 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.450
 but they have they have a common point that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.680
 is vain a price and a quality of play 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 because that for us is that it's 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.290
 something very important in 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.730
 angles where you see these figurines 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.170
 particular in gaza helped bias 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.120
 very particular because people the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.560
 fir but the death very very expensive so 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.739
 in fact it is a luxury product what 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.510
 y'en full in a game after all 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.370
 there is tutti frutti that more for the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.810
 little difference and tutti frutti I'll go 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.769
 so difference first then a little 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.750
 all you did not care for a little bit 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.860
 bigger and then wasabi gobs 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.060
 panic the white nose in the game 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.489
 really for the family to agree 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.070
 ok and also if you had us ourselves 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.900
 summarize a little bit the not say the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.560
 editorial line of gigamic and if that's 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.530
 possible because how are you 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.519
 declared it a no we went away from 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.500
 our story both of them 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.230
 start from the abstract wooden game it's 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.360
 still our heart is and we 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.620
 has diversified over time because 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.120
 that the team has diversified too 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.920
 because now we are we are more 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.799
 many and that we are surrounded by 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.820
 passionate about the game and so we could 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.500
 open up to other things and then because 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.049
 that technically we have been able to 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.239
 to do something other than wooden play 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.010
 so today is difficult to 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.380
 give a line even if in fact it's 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.019
 often still simple games 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.650
 explained in less than five minutes played 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.780
 in 20 minutes maximum and and with a 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.100
 particular material and there I am in 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.900
 talk only about the part 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.250
 edition 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.569
 because in distribution there it is 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 completely different we have the games 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.250
 big players like my opinion I really 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.330
 little games card games 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.510
 okay then you explain to me everything to 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.230
 the time just that historia so 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.960
 it's a game that was still editing 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.670
 with with i range i will i am 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.810
 there are which game that are coediting 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.790
 with gigamic and then what are the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.830
 criteria that will make that of that to 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.590
 switch to coedition rather than 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.270
 distribution what a job 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.390
 particular gigamic will put in the 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.920
 game to come up with the coedition the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.450
 coediting decision ben that's not the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.790
 stature a bit complicated because it's 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.670
 a crush is we discover a 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.030
 game in our partners or what 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.070
 anyway 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.660
 and then we were a favorite we 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.580
 speak in the team we play a lot and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.870
 then when all said no but there 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.520
 that's where we come across this one have 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.740
 really think it's really good 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.060
 11th 'down ok we are ok to engage 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.650
 obviously goes on when we do our 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.950
 box that we need to engage on 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 quantities that's another investment 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.410
 is behind necessarily we have this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.090
 freedom on the translation on the box 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.370
 here is to make a version really 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.650
 ideal for comfortable play 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.290
 Francophones agree and it can go 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.240
 even to the farthest 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.140
 adjustment development work 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.600
 of the game or for now you will want 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.980
 yet not necessarily to where there to 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.529
 games confrere pro anyway 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.549
 much changed on 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.739
 I think of a game like winning your dad 

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:21.539
 its version that we propose to 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.649
 the export because it is a deal 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.100
 still a little different but good at 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:25.900
 export 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.030
 it is broadcast but it is completely 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.970
 different with another name with a 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.870
 another box with another rule of 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.460
 a little simplified game 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.340
 these are evolutions that can 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.930
 take place like the games for which one has 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.310
 again edition with amigo we put them 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.450
 in metal boxes where friends you 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.010
 put them sending cards have failed to 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.380
 full of life full of things possible 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.300
 what after generally does not change 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.950
 intrinsically the game because if he has 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.790
 been edited by a publisher who is serious 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.380
 hungry for everything we have 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.970
 they did the job they know the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.380
 do not let them take 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.920
 it's more a marketing side and boxes 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:04.040
 from his super just a little last 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.380
 question at the level of two of the projects to 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.780
 come for gigamic is what there are 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.420
 things that are really important 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.780
 that they are you bet you for 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.030
 for the coming months years 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.260
 we have a lot of things 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.060
 so there are a lot of things going on 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.620
 decide there now especially when we 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.960
 talk about distribution and editions 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.400
 voice is where we meet our 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.510
 partners and discover their 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.040
 novelties but what has we already 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.050
 seen but here for example we see the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.490
 final material where we see 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.480
 things are changing and there are a lot of 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.090
 decisions that will go there 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.040
 now and and in edition 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.480
 it's a little bit like that I've 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.980
 met many authors a lot 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.110
 a few days ago that they already have 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.250
 sold in the pipes and that makes 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.030
 highlight in particular a game that we have 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.370
 found on flip 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.610
 so here we go into the short game 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.110
 small a children's game and we have 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.820
 really want to do an owl thing 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.260
 and we really believe in it very well and so 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.700
 the rise and a big bet for us 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.960
 this year and I'm here is what is 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.090
 that one with all our heart he is there 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.070
 this year 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.630
 well listen thanks for all these 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.440
 information have the time you have 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.300
 taken for our respondents 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.300
 and then good luck on the show
