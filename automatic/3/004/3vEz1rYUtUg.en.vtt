one<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.550> skeptical<00:01:02.910> about

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
one that I was the most skeptical about

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.800

was<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> loss<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.280> trackball<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
was the loss of the trackball and the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.190 
was the loss of the trackball and the
addition<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.619> optical<00:01:08.070> trackpad

admittedly<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.290> wasn't<00:01:10.710> quite<00:01:10.950> sure<00:01:11.010> Alice<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
admittedly I wasn't quite sure Alice is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.490

for<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> while<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.060> haven't<00:02:59.270> used<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.810> phone

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
for a while but I haven't used a phone

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.750 
for a while but I haven't used a phone
with<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> dedicated<00:03:00.709> keyboard<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.370> while<00:03:01.490> and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
with a dedicated keyboard in a while and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
keyboard on the bold I think it's going

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
but for me I really enjoyed it the

but for me I really enjoyed it the
keyboard<00:03:09.620> was<00:03:09.860> very<00:03:10.100> easy<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.520> use<00:03:10.730> there<00:03:11.660> was

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
keyboard was very easy to use there was

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.690 
keyboard was very easy to use there was
a<00:03:11.780> bit<00:03:12.050> of<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.620> learning<00:03:12.980> curve<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.459> sort<00:03:13.640> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
a bit of a learning curve and sort of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.730 
a bit of a learning curve and sort of
training<00:03:14.000> my<00:03:14.090> fingers<00:03:14.450> where<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.750> hit<00:03:14.959> there

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
training my fingers where to hit there
