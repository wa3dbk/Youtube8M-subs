can't blame them for hating and but

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.170 
can't blame them for hating and but
Richard<00:00:32.640> didn't<00:00:33.090> hate<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.860> when<00:00:34.860> he<00:00:35.149> when<00:00:36.149> he

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
Richard didn't hate and when he when he

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
Richard didn't hate and when he when he
showed<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.800> still<00:00:38.129> hating

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
showed that and they were still hating

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
showed that and they were still hating
again<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.239> further<00:00:39.510> betrayal<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.260> think

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
again that was further betrayal I think

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.260 
again that was further betrayal I think
for<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.190> he<00:00:44.640> suffered<00:00:45.120> from

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
for them and I think he suffered from

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330 
for them and I think he suffered from
his<00:00:45.510> own<00:00:45.660> black<00:00:45.870> community<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.129> think

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
his own black community for it I think

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
his own black community for it I think
he<00:00:47.399> paid<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> price<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:48.149> he<00:00:48.239> went<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
he paid a price when he went out with

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
he paid a price when he went out with
white<00:00:48.809> women<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.440> Malcolm<00:00:49.829> s<00:00:50.010> yeah<00:00:50.430> oh<00:00:50.550> yeah
