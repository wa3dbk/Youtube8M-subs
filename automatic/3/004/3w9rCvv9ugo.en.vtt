popsicle stick and I'm going to use my

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.200 
popsicle stick and I'm going to use my
hot<00:01:14.470> glue<00:01:14.619> gun<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.310> can<00:01:15.520> also<00:01:15.820> use

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
hot glue gun but you can also use

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.410 
hot glue gun but you can also use
alternative<00:01:17.020> glue<00:01:17.260> like<00:01:17.710> Google<00:01:18.220> or<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:19.180> can

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
alternative glue like Google or you can

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.289 
alternative glue like Google or you can
use<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.680> regular<00:01:20.860> white<00:01:21.310> school<00:01:21.760> glue<00:01:21.790> it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
use the regular white school glue it

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.080 
use the regular white school glue it
just<00:01:22.600> takes<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.320> little<00:01:23.440> bit<00:01:23.710> longer<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.909> dry

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
just takes a little bit longer to dry

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.270 
just takes a little bit longer to dry
than<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:26.110> hot<00:01:26.260> glue<00:01:26.470> gun<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.130> why

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
than the hot glue gun and this is why

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.620 
than the hot glue gun and this is why
I'm<00:01:27.400> using<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.760> hot<00:01:27.909> glue<00:01:28.090> gun<00:01:28.119> for<00:01:28.299> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
I'm using the hot glue gun for the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.200 
I'm using the hot glue gun for the
purpose<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.400> sharing<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.490> video<00:01:30.700> with<00:01:31.060> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
we proceed to attach it and now we are

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.830 
we proceed to attach it and now we are
going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.560> again<00:02:28.560> take<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.950> piece<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.400> orange

shape so that it will be our little fish
fin<00:02:40.370> now<00:02:41.370> again<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.299> don't<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.049> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
fin now again you don't have to use the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
using for me because I think this will
