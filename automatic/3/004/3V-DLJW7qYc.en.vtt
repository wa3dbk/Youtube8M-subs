a very fast right left right sequence of

a very fast right left right sequence of

into the corner I mean I stood the thing

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.540 
into the corner I mean I stood the thing
I<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:54.420> believe<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.899> I've<00:00:55.050> seen<00:00:55.290> he<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
fast into the corner well he's nothing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
fast into the corner well he's nothing
sort<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> extra<00:01:00.300> special<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.320> way

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

that he controls the car almost with a
throttle<00:01:04.589> instead<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.009> where<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
throttle instead of where I think the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.430 
throttle instead of where I think the
majority<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.780> drivers<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.460> I've<00:01:08.610> known

break you change down the gears and then

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.300 
break you change down the gears and then
you<00:01:19.200> might<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> off<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> throttle

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you might go on and off the throttle

nothing<00:01:20.759> Ayrton<00:01:21.149> was<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.390> bigger<00:01:21.570> biggest

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
nothing Ayrton was the bigger biggest

nothing Ayrton was the bigger biggest
example<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.800> when<00:01:23.250> he<00:01:23.429> used<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.940> in

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
example of that when he used to be in

example of that when he used to be in
the<00:01:24.179> middle<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> corner<00:01:24.990> he's<00:01:25.590> throttle

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the middle of a corner he's throttle

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
the middle of a corner he's throttle
movement<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.820> quick<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> he<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.869> always

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
movement was so quick and he was always

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.169 
movement was so quick and he was always
Papa<00:01:28.619> Papa<00:01:28.860> Papa<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.610> throttle<00:01:29.820> when

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
Papa Papa Papa on the throttle when

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.169 
Papa Papa Papa on the throttle when
michael<00:01:30.690> has<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.350> break<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.520> changing<00:01:33.030> down

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
michael has this break in changing down

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.150 
michael has this break in changing down
then<00:01:33.330> he's<00:01:33.560> constantly<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.950> throttle

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
then he's constantly on the throttle

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.140 
then he's constantly on the throttle
straightaway

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.000 

even<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:41.240> every<00:01:41.630> driver<00:01:41.960> was<00:01:42.320> driving<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.770> white

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
even if every driver was driving a white

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.130 
even if every driver was driving a white
car<00:01:43.310> with<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.580> white<00:01:43.850> helmet<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:44.690> could<00:01:44.900> still

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
car with a white helmet we could still

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.469 
car with a white helmet we could still
just<00:01:45.409> about<00:01:45.710> see<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.220> technique<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.909> Michael

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
just about see the technique of Michael

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.270 
just about see the technique of Michael
Schumacher<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.470> wouldn't<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.830> easy<00:01:48.860> though

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
Schumacher it wouldn't be easy though

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.700 
Schumacher it wouldn't be easy though
and<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.060> get<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.210> much<00:01:50.420> better<00:01:50.450> idea<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.470> need<00:01:51.619> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
and to get a much better idea we need to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.620 
and to get a much better idea we need to
look<00:01:51.860> at<00:01:51.979> data<00:01:52.159> recordings<00:01:52.820> taken<00:01:53.270> from<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
look at data recordings taken from the

the<00:01:56.150> throttle<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:56.720> also<00:01:57.470> cause<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> braids

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
the throttle and also cause the braids

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.040 
the throttle and also cause the braids
and<00:01:58.880> we've<00:01:59.000> had<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.150> rare<00:01:59.390> opportunity<00:01:59.540> to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
and we've had a rare opportunity to

is<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.880> throttle<00:02:08.390> when<00:02:09.110> it's<00:02:09.229> right<00:02:09.470> at<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.739> top

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
is a throttle when it's right at the top

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.699 
is a throttle when it's right at the top
it's<00:02:10.700> full<00:02:11.030> throttle<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.020> now<00:02:12.050> we<00:02:12.290> can<00:02:12.470> see

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it's full throttle and so now we can see

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's full throttle and so now we can see

at johnny herbert steering input on the
straight<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.550> much<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.910> same<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.330> in<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
straight is much the same but in the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.990

middle of the corner he's not so near

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.080 
middle of the corner he's not so near
the<00:04:11.150> edge<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.080> trace<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.650> smoother<00:04:13.310> as

the edge and so the trace is smoother as

seconds or 100 meters at the end of the
lab<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:28.060> think<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> main<00:04:29.360> ability<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.139> have<00:04:30.500> is

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
lab I think the main ability I have is

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.340 
lab I think the main ability I have is
that<00:04:30.979> I<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.120> good<00:04:32.360> feeling<00:04:32.600> for<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.050> limit

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
that I have a good feeling for the limit

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.379 
that I have a good feeling for the limit
a<00:04:33.560> very<00:04:33.919> consistent<00:04:34.520> feeling<00:04:34.850> for<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.120> limit

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
a very consistent feeling for the limit

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.070 
a very consistent feeling for the limit
inner<00:04:35.600> I'm<00:04:36.110> able<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.590> run<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.800> car<00:04:38.050> for<00:04:39.050> almost

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
inner I'm able to run the car for almost

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.290 
inner I'm able to run the car for almost
one<00:04:39.860> hundred<00:04:39.950> percent<00:04:40.160> on<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.850> limit<00:04:41.150> and

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
one hundred percent on the limit and

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.290 
one hundred percent on the limit and
that's<00:04:42.050> probably<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.880> difference<00:04:43.880> in<00:04:44.030> style

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
that's probably the difference in style

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.440 
that's probably the difference in style
where<00:04:44.770> someone<00:04:45.770> has<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.460> ability<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:46.880> do<00:04:47.300> that

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
where someone has the ability to do that

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.930 
where someone has the ability to do that
in<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.470> entry<00:04:48.800> of<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.919> corner<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.520> not<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.700> mid

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
in the entry of the corner but not a mid

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.480 
in the entry of the corner but not a mid
corner<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.600> then<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.050> exit<00:04:51.380> again<00:04:51.650> or<00:04:51.950> the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
corner and then the exit again or the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.390 
corner and then the exit again or the
other<00:04:52.610> way<00:04:52.760> around<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.630> can<00:04:54.560> almost<00:04:55.010> do

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
other way around and I I can almost do

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.050 
other way around and I I can almost do
this<00:04:55.580> all<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.120> way<00:04:56.210> around<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.690> corner
