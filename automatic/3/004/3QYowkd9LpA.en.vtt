blue<00:00:07.080> uh<00:00:07.350> yeah<00:00:08.059> right<00:00:09.059> now<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
blue uh yeah right now it is just a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.480 
blue uh yeah right now it is just a
demonstration<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.679> hot<00:00:10.860> air<00:00:10.889> balloon<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
demonstration of hot air balloon you

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.839 
demonstration of hot air balloon you
know<00:00:11.580> huh<00:00:11.940> whoa<00:00:12.719> still<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.700> only

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
know huh whoa still think and the only

know huh whoa still think and the only
the<00:00:15.360> cool<00:00:15.570> thing<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.809> whenever<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.500> for

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the cool thing is whenever you get for

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.900 
the cool thing is whenever you get for
you<00:00:16.859> could<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.100> make<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.490> whenever<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
you could just make this whenever you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.650 
you could just make this whenever you
want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> I'm<00:00:19.289> sliding<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:21.270> whatever<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

going to start now doing it ok just the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.560 
going to start now doing it ok just the
first<00:00:50.250> thing<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.760> need<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.270> gravity

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
first thing is you just need one gravity

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.520 
first thing is you just need one gravity
loads<00:00:52.699> because<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.629> i<00:00:54.719> grab<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.289> way

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
loads because I can i grab that it's way

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
loads because I can i grab that it's way
over<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.930> you're<00:00:57.930> playing<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:58.530> gravity

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
over there you're playing in my gravity

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.910 
over there you're playing in my gravity
lips<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.940> too<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.300> work

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
lips then it's going to be too much work

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
lips then it's going to be too much work
believe<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.100> ok<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.780> need<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
believe it or not ok so you just need a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
believe it or not ok so you just need a
gravity<00:01:04.439> lift<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> any<00:01:05.850> type<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.450> building

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
gravity lift and any type of a building

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
gravity lift and any type of a building
whatever<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> bugger

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
whatever you do do not do the bugger

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.820 
whatever you do do not do the bugger
small<00:01:09.000> cover<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.650> but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
small cover well you can do that one but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
small cover well you can do that one but
it<00:01:10.920> doesn't<00:01:11.220> work<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.369> well<00:01:11.750> pyramid<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.900> not

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it doesn't work that well pyramid do not

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
it doesn't work that well pyramid do not
try<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.680> tower<00:01:14.430> tall<00:01:15.979> no<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.310> try<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.549> one

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
try and tower tall no don't try that one

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.840 
try and tower tall no don't try that one
either<00:01:18.380> then<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> try<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
either then one so you do want to try is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.820 
either then one so you do want to try is
the<00:01:21.240> town<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.810> story<00:01:22.200> around<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.790> box

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the town or two story around in a box

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
the town or two story around in a box
usually<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:26.189> favorite<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.150> story

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
usually my favorite is the two story

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480 
usually my favorite is the two story
which<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> flew<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
which it's the one that flew in the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.770 
which it's the one that flew in the
boonies<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> first<00:01:31.439> thing<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
boonies so first thing you got to do is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
boonies so first thing you got to do is
always<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.320> flat<00:01:34.860> surface<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.310> grab<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
always have a flat surface so grab a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.810 
always have a flat surface so grab a
five<00:01:35.939> by<00:01:36.090> five<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.170> top<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> smell

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
five by five and put it on top of smell

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.649 
five by five and put it on top of smell
because<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.090> put<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.240> top<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
because when you put on top of the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.010 
because when you put on top of the
mountain<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.290> riveting<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> then

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
mountain you got more riveting and then

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.160 
mountain you got more riveting and then
you<00:01:43.530> grab

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
you grab

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.880 
you grab
cannons<00:01:45.920> men<00:01:46.900> people<00:01:47.900> always<00:01:48.350> craft<00:01:48.799> a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
cannons men people always craft a

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.060 
cannons men people always craft a
vehicle<00:01:49.540> canopen<00:01:50.540> vehicle<00:01:50.930> if<00:01:51.680> you're<00:01:51.860> doing

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
vehicle canopen vehicle if you're doing

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.910 
vehicle canopen vehicle if you're doing
a<00:01:52.159> bunker<00:01:52.520> box<00:01:53.000> staying<00:01:53.420> crap<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.920> gravity

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
a bunker box staying crap the gravity

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.399 
a bunker box staying crap the gravity
would<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.540> can<00:01:56.689> see<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:56.990> not<00:01:57.200> moving

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
would if you can see it's not moving

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.749 
would if you can see it's not moving
right<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.979> because<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.549> some<00:01:58.729> reason

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
right now and because for some reason

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.960 
right now and because for some reason
it's<00:01:59.210> locked<00:01:59.799> hold<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.280> building<00:02:01.610> hold

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
it's locked hold on to the building hold

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.060 
it's locked hold on to the building hold
on<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.330> gravity<00:02:02.659> cannons<00:02:03.470> man<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.890> there

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
