00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
like quiet I hear it and it begins with

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.810 
like quiet I hear it and it begins with
a<00:00:18.029> feeling<00:00:18.360> I<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.769> it<00:00:19.920> feels<00:00:20.189> like

be going to be a big hit from an upset

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.990 
be going to be a big hit from an upset
by<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> orchestra<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
by the orchestra is it going to be a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
by the orchestra is it going to be a
medium<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.370> know

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
medium to do and then you kind of know

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.630 
medium to do and then you kind of know
how<00:00:45.329> fast<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.899> should<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.350> slow<00:00:46.859> so<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
how fast they should be or slow so it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
how fast they should be or slow so it
starts<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.359> like<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> Bulacan<00:00:49.079> thread<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
starts it's like a Bulacan thread it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
starts it's like a Bulacan thread it
reveals<00:00:50.699> it<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.710> an<00:00:53.160> easy<00:00:53.309> process

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
reveals it so it is not an easy process

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.930 
reveals it so it is not an easy process
and<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.600> something<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> learn<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.500> time

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and it's something you learn over time

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.020 
and it's something you learn over time
the<00:00:56.940> most<00:00:57.120> important<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> surrender

little good as we did and the camera has
to<00:02:25.820> be<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.209> them<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.989> have<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> picture

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
to be on them so that you have a picture

to be on them so that you have a picture
the<00:02:28.910> microphone<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.600> violin<00:02:30.050> has<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.500> be

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the microphone of the violin has to be

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.070 
the microphone of the violin has to be
in<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.769> specific<00:02:30.950> spot<00:02:31.489> within<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> quarter<00:02:32.900> inch

in a specific spot within a quarter inch
or<00:02:33.890> else<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.250> sound<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.640> not<00:02:34.670> food<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:36.019> there's

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
or else the sound is not food so there's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.820 
or else the sound is not food so there's
a<00:02:36.730> 20<00:02:37.730> 25<00:02:38.299> 30<00:02:38.720> different<00:02:38.989> things<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.530> have<00:02:39.680> to

to<00:02:41.600> get<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> good<00:02:42.049> video<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:44.269> it<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.600> takes

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
to get a good video and in it is takes

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.110 
to get a good video and in it is takes
months<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:46.010> planning

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
months of planning

anymore<00:04:03.230> 21<00:04:03.859> this<00:04:04.669> is<00:04:04.819> very<00:04:05.180> free<00:04:05.569> I<00:04:06.280> still

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
anymore 21 this is very free I still

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280 
anymore 21 this is very free I still
care<00:04:07.790> about<00:04:08.030> my<00:04:08.180> concerts<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.870> still<00:04:09.139> care

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
care about my concerts and I still care

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.170 
care about my concerts and I still care
about<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:09.889> God<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.609> think<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
about what God is going to think and I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.180 
about what God is going to think and I
still<00:04:11.450> work<00:04:11.599> really<00:04:11.870> hard<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.680> give<00:04:12.859> them<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
still work really hard to give them the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.899 
still work really hard to give them the
best

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
best

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.000 
best
but<00:04:15.909> if<00:04:16.209> there's<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.720> freedom<00:04:17.530> there's<00:04:17.829> a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
but if there's a freedom there's a

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.100 
but if there's a freedom there's a
relaxation<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.970> comes<00:04:19.239> with<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:22.110> I

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
relaxation that comes with that and I

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.320 
relaxation that comes with that and I
like<00:04:23.350> when<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> go<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.160> different<00:04:24.940> countries

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
like when I go to different countries

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.650 
like when I go to different countries
and<00:04:25.840> they<00:04:26.650> accept<00:04:27.070> me<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:29.970> never<00:04:30.970> forget<00:04:31.479> the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
and they accept me I never forget the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.280 
and they accept me I never forget the
quarter<00:04:31.960> again<00:04:32.199> audiences<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.100> how<00:04:34.290> amazing
