00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
when you're looking at where to store

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.480 
when you're looking at where to store
cutting<00:00:01.770> boards<00:00:02.129> there<00:00:02.280> are<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> lot<00:00:02.460> of

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
cutting boards there are a lot of

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.760 
cutting boards there are a lot of
different<00:00:02.909> options<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:03.480> can<00:00:03.600> as<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.650> can

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
different options you can as you can

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.980 
different options you can as you can
lean<00:00:04.920> them<00:00:05.100> against<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.520> wall<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:06.330> your<00:00:06.390> counter

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
lean them against a wall on your counter

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.600 
lean them against a wall on your counter
space<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.620> leave<00:00:07.770> them<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
space you can leave them out on the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.490 
space you can leave them out on the
counter<00:00:08.760> space<00:00:09.030> if<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.540> especially<00:00:10.230> if<00:00:10.440> you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
counter space if you especially if you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.070 
counter space if you especially if you
have<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> lot<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> counter<00:00:11.219> space<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.420> great

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
have a lot of counter space it's a great

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
have a lot of counter space it's a great
idea<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.559> find<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.070> spot<00:00:14.340> where<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.849> have

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
idea to find a spot where you just have

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.990 
idea to find a spot where you just have
your<00:00:14.969> cutting<00:00:15.330> board<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> time<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
your cutting board out all the time and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.830 
your cutting board out all the time and
a<00:00:18.000> lot<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> people<00:00:18.990> keep<00:00:19.529> them<00:00:19.710> behind<00:00:19.980> their

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
a lot of people keep them behind their

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.160 
a lot of people keep them behind their
their<00:00:21.890> their<00:00:22.890> sink<00:00:23.330> like<00:00:24.330> light<00:00:24.660> leaned<00:00:25.050> up

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
their their sink like light leaned up

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
their their sink like light leaned up
against<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> wall<00:00:26.599> that<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:29.119> out<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
against the wall that way it's out and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440 
against the wall that way it's out and
ready<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> use<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:32.369> once<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> wash

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
ready to use but you know once you wash

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
ready to use but you know once you wash
it<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.050> stick<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> dry

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it you can just stick it up there to dry

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
it you can just stick it up there to dry
it's<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:35.760> an<00:00:35.940> easy<00:00:36.090> place<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> let<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it's and that's an easy place to let it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.750 
it's and that's an easy place to let it
dry<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.070> cutting<00:00:38.399> boards<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.559> I

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
dry these are my cutting boards and I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.650 
dry these are my cutting boards and I
kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> keep<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> different<00:00:42.420> places

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
kind of keep them in different places

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
kind of keep them in different places
around<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.320> kitchen<00:00:43.610> just<00:00:44.610> based<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> where

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
around the kitchen just based on where

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
around the kitchen just based on where
I'm<00:00:45.300> using<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> why<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.710> using<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
I'm using them and why I'm using them in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.209 
I'm using them and why I'm using them in
those<00:00:47.399> space<00:00:47.870> these<00:00:48.870> smaller<00:00:49.440> cutting<00:00:49.860> boards

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
those space these smaller cutting boards

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.930 
those space these smaller cutting boards
for<00:00:50.309> instance<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.180> over<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.940> counter

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
for instance I use over on this counter

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
for instance I use over on this counter
the<00:00:54.090> most<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> keep<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.440> over

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the most so I'm going to keep them over

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
the most so I'm going to keep them over
there<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:57.210> keep<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.109> keep<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
there and I keep I actually keep this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.670 
there and I keep I actually keep this
one<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.399> my<00:01:00.329> drying<00:01:00.600> rack<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
one in my drying rack because it's the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
one in my drying rack because it's the
one<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.219> most<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> time<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
one that I use most of the time so I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
one that I use most of the time so I
just<00:01:04.080> keep<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.189> most<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> most<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
just keep it there most of the most of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.649 
just keep it there most of the most of
the<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:09.080> these<00:01:10.080> other<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:11.659> slightly

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the time and these other two slightly

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.950 
the time and these other two slightly
smaller<00:01:13.100> cutting<00:01:14.100> boards<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.670> store<00:01:15.390> behind

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
smaller cutting boards I store behind

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.700 
smaller cutting boards I store behind
the<00:01:16.470> drying<00:01:16.740> rack<00:01:18.140> because<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.650> them

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the drying rack because I can put them

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
the drying rack because I can put them
there<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.130> they're<00:01:20.310> wet<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> they'll

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
there when they're wet and and they'll

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
there when they're wet and and they'll
the<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.890> water<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:27.150> run<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.110> them

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the the water will will run off of them

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
the the water will will run off of them
but<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.040> use<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.640> much<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.119> use

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
but I don't use them as much as I use

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
but I don't use them as much as I use
this<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.290> keeping<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.799> all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
this one that I just I'm keeping out all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
this one that I just I'm keeping out all
the<00:01:32.100> time<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:33.990> big

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the time and then I have this really big

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030 
the time and then I have this really big
cutting<00:01:34.590> board<00:01:35.150> which<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.409> use<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cutting board which I don't use this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
cutting board which I don't use this
often<00:01:38.310> unless<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.210> making<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.720> big

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
often unless I'm making a really big

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.460 
often unless I'm making a really big
meal<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.350> I'm

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
meal and so and if I use it then I'm

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
meal and so and if I use it then I'm
usually<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.460> using<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.210> here

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
usually actually using it over here

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
usually actually using it over here
sometimes<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.680> use<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.880> counter

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sometimes I use it on that the counter

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
sometimes I use it on that the counter
space<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.600> sink<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> keep<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> over

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
space by the sink but I keep it over

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.139 
space by the sink but I keep it over
here<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.250> lean<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.759> against<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
here and just lean it up against the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.499 
here and just lean it up against the
wall<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:55.700> mostly<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
wall right there mostly just it's out of

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.850
