only<00:02:29.819> got<00:02:30.030> five<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.440> as<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.610> where

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
only got five and as you can see where

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.970 
only got five and as you can see where
the<00:02:33.060> player<00:02:33.360> ratings<00:02:33.840> wilfried<00:02:34.290> zaha<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.799> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the player ratings wilfried zaha is the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.550 
the player ratings wilfried zaha is the
best<00:02:35.190> player<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:35.879> team<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:37.049> think<00:02:37.380> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
best player on my team and I think that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
best player on my team and I think that
he<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.799> be<00:02:37.980> proud<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.549> his<00:02:38.850> first<00:02:39.090> game<00:02:39.389> for

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
he can be proud of his first game for

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.580 
he can be proud of his first game for
Cardiff<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> off<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:42.540> five<00:02:42.780> plate<00:02:43.079> game<00:02:43.380> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
Cardiff so off the five plate game I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.710 
Cardiff so off the five plate game I
think<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.609> look<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> league

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
think we can have a look at the league

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.539 
think we can have a look at the league
table<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.350> see<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.739> Cardiff<00:02:47.100> City<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
table and see that Cardiff City is

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.030 
table and see that Cardiff City is
currently<00:02:47.880> placed<00:02:48.120> 13th<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:49.440> seven<00:02:49.799> points

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
currently placed 13th with seven points

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.780 
currently placed 13th with seven points
but<00:02:50.940> only<00:02:51.239> two<00:02:51.450> wins<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.049> one<00:02:52.290> draw<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.920> as

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
but only two wins and one draw and as

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.580 
but only two wins and one draw and as
you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.150> by<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.569> league<00:02:54.780> table<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.410> most

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
you can see by the league table the most

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.410 
you can see by the league table the most
surprising<00:02:55.769> thing<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.549> less<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
surprising thing is that less is the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.020 
surprising thing is that less is the
city<00:02:57.660> has<00:02:58.500> when<00:02:58.709> all<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.130> his<00:02:59.250> five<00:02:59.489> games<00:02:59.819> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
city has when all of his five games and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.449 
city has when all of his five games and
nottingham<00:03:00.780> forest<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.889> behind<00:03:02.069> them

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
nottingham forest is just behind them

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.780 
nottingham forest is just behind them
with<00:03:02.819> only<00:03:03.030> one<00:03:03.329> draw<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> next<00:03:05.400> game<00:03:05.579> will

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
with only one draw so the next game will

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.940 
with only one draw so the next game will
be<00:03:05.940> against<00:03:06.239> West<00:03:06.450> Ham<00:03:06.569> United<00:03:06.859> who<00:03:07.859> are

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
be against West Ham United who are

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.379 
be against West Ham United who are
probably<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.459> best<00:03:08.730> team<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.359> league

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
probably the best team in the league

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.620 
probably the best team in the league
when<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.260> look<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> player<00:03:10.950> step<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.599> I

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
when you look at the player step so I

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.809 
when you look at the player step so I
