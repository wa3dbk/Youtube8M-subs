00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello people medal here to show to the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.480
 an analysis of this microphone 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.589
 microphone chop year directs all are 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.630
 You'll see on this day it's being 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 recorded with the microphone is in the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710
 above the machine that the machine is not 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 of directly connected microphones 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 machine by jec 3.5 mm 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.070
 The only thing I 'll do in editing is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 make it not only on the two channels 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.369
 explains the microphone is warm or just 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.039
 leave the channels is common to see 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 Stonehenge is very common until you see it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.340
 happen ends so that's the sound 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.219
 original microphone without any 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.960
 inhibition what I did was copy these 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.270
 are you are seeing one side one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.190
 copy it and bring it to the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.050
 to make in both cases the time 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 this is it and so I am with you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 are watching now and will come the rest of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.969
 virtuous emissions channels 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 I think it 's sad that the specs 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 microphone techniques are in the description 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 of a visit dodi and now we go to the part 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.030
 of oxygen a microphone wins in this 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 box with you can see right on the island 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:16.439
 of the black box hawaii 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:26.340
 You know, okay, so there 's only one good side. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:31.740
 I already had an attitude face if I did not 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 I do not know how to make a mistake on the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:42.320
 logical machine to bring in the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.509
 always block the other who a car 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.380
 that is eight meters is very cable 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.270
 one of the tips xlr pointing 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 into the microphone to traverse the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 line and works as phantom paulo the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.070
 which is very good and the other end has a 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.990
 entry 6.15 I'm not mistaken 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.410
 then comes with an adapter for three 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.630
 51mm which is the most common 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 and here in the field we have to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:20.230
 avoid this set is already done 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:27.430
 here microphone today can see 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:34.810
 xia read that the front 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:36.070
 right the daughter leads to a stack of a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.020
 good team and this is very good 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.630
 consuming and is powered by a battery 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.950
 only needed in May if 4 thousand cent 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.900
 and twenty-six hours as you can see in 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.760
 description of swimming pools specifications 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.440
 can buy a smaller car has been 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.820
 what I did to walk counting the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.290
 hanging is 8 meters 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.220
 I bought one of 30 centimeters per 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.010
 about 200 m free a microphone is all 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 in metal and only this part inside the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.770
 This environmental pile is just this part. 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.860
 here this affection here is plastic rest 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.620
 all this and also total all such all 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.080
 microphone is in such a microphone has 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.450
 about 36 centimeters being one with the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 sponge and the car ends up being still 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.250
 a bit though the microphone has the option 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.810
 screen is normal the board listened to 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.940
 long on this day when they will listen and have 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.940
 normal I'm going to change the sound now 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.030
 now it's on screen I'll talk a little 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.790
 but because sound is not enough 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 the motel is gives a bigger gain but also 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.290
 captures more sound 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.970
 ready there in the background gives a gain only country 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.190
 just use a car still remains 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.000
 chemistry were almost upon me and it's going 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.510
 to burst in the case will come back porn again 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.290
 Normal is ready to put the standard screens 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.230
 was used for when what we 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.519
 we will say that to be further away is not that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.260
 will capture better but will also capture 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.269
 plus the anthem in the background as in the back 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.010
 Microphone quality / price ratio is 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.900
 completely incompatible I search 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.650
 living now we need to make a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.470
 video are in europe rn were not 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.110
 give the 40 euros 50 a car more 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.090
 I have met more times already 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.560
 I found it cheaper and probably 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.910
 You want to send another one from China. 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.680
 out of Europe will find it cheaper 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.090
 than the 30's and I think that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.340
 everything is in one 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.350
 we worship 1 to 1 or keep thinking 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.240
 connected directly to the recorder'm not 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.230
 a lot of saints say anything 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.020
 the image of the institution 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.860
 I'm going to help whatever they know about the council. 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.860
 and next
