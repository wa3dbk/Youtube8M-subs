let's play now after this momentous

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.900 
let's play now after this momentous
failure<00:00:06.379> I'm<00:00:07.379> gonna<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:08.040> gonna<00:00:08.220> build<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.790> on

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
failure I'm gonna I'm gonna build it on

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.770 
failure I'm gonna I'm gonna build it on
land<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.440> know<00:00:10.700> blissful<00:00:11.700> dryness<00:00:13.340> so

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
land in you know blissful dryness so

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.210 
land in you know blissful dryness so
that<00:00:15.780> way<00:00:15.960> i<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.170> build<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.770> relatively

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that way i can build it relatively

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.000 
that way i can build it relatively
easily<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.390> then<00:00:19.140> I'll<00:00:19.260> flood<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.680> water

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
easily and then I'll flood it with water

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.179 
easily and then I'll flood it with water
and<00:00:21.050> I'll<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.230> an<00:00:22.320> underwater<00:00:22.619> house<00:00:22.920> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and I'll have an underwater house that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
and I'll have an underwater house that
way<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.230> wanted<00:00:25.680> myself<00:00:26.039> built

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
way because I know I wanted myself built

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.089 
way because I know I wanted myself built
it<00:00:26.519> under<00:00:26.730> water<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.980> just

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it under water but it's just it's just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
it under water but it's just it's just
not<00:00:29.340> feasible<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.920> build<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
not feasible to build like this as you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.950 
not feasible to build like this as you
can<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:34.309> actually<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> bottom<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
can see actually it is the bottom of the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.520 
can see actually it is the bottom of the
lake<00:00:37.399> that<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> bottom<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> lake<00:00:39.530> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
lake that is the bottom of the lake and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
lake that is the bottom of the lake and
on<00:00:41.100> i<00:00:41.129> might<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.670> able<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:43.010> yeah

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
on i might be able to do it now yeah

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.600 
on i might be able to do it now yeah
that's<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> bottom<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> lake<00:00:45.230> mmm<00:00:46.610> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that's the bottom of the lake mmm you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
that's the bottom of the lake mmm you
know<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.210> gonna<00:00:48.570> wait<00:00:48.809> till<00:00:49.020> daytime

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
know what I'm gonna wait till daytime

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
know what I'm gonna wait till daytime
when<00:00:49.739> there's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.870> pierce

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
when there's a lot more like to pierce

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.310 
when there's a lot more like to pierce
the<00:00:51.899> blackness<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.690> see<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.079> actually

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the blackness and see if I can actually

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.479 
the blackness and see if I can actually
build<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.600> underwater<00:00:57.600> straight<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.410> will<00:00:59.250> say

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
build it underwater straight up will say

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.660 
build it underwater straight up will say
I<00:00:59.730> mean<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.079> help<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.670> well

I mean I've not got much help but well
I'll<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:02.969> least<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.570> before<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> give<00:01:04.949> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
I'll at least have a go before I give in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.390 
I'll at least have a go before I give in
and<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> land<00:01:06.420> option<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and go for the land option so now I just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
and go for the land option so now I just
need<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> pass<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.990> night<00:01:10.770> time<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.840> know

while one of my super cereal awesome
transition<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:19.170> daytime<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> can't

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
transition to daytime that you can't

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
transition to daytime that you can't
even<00:01:20.820> tell<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.360> they're<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.810> ninja

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
stealthily why did I just stop talking

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.530 
stealthily why did I just stop talking
with<00:01:27.090> tenants<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.540> press<00:01:27.720> escape<00:01:28.579> what<00:01:29.579> tell

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
with tenants and press escape what tell

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560 
with tenants and press escape what tell

pressed escape anyway I'm gonna do a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.880 
pressed escape anyway I'm gonna do a
subtle<00:01:44.340> transition<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.360> daytime<00:01:46.079> Oh<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:46.710> was

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
subtle transition to daytime Oh what was

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
subtle transition to daytime Oh what was
that<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.369> worked<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.540> didn't<00:01:48.840> even<00:01:48.960> see

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that it worked and you didn't even see

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
that it worked and you didn't even see
it<00:01:49.380> happen<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> call<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it happen that's what you call a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.770 
it happen that's what you call a
transition<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.770> let's<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
transition right so let's see if the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
transition right so let's see if the
change<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.079> lighting<00:01:55.500> actually<00:01:55.979> makes<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
change in lighting actually makes this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
change in lighting actually makes this
doable<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.329> fact<00:01:57.570> still<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.799> pitch

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
doable or is it in fact still just pitch

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.420 
doable or is it in fact still just pitch
like<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.490> slightly<00:01:59.880> better<00:02:00.920> let<00:02:01.920> me<00:02:01.950> kill

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
like it's slightly better let me kill

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
like it's slightly better let me kill
that<00:02:02.549> block

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that block

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.430 
that block
hmm<00:02:05.770> i<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:06.579> know<00:02:06.909> i'm<00:02:07.119> tempted<00:02:07.539> I<00:02:07.810> am<00:02:07.840> very

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
hmm i don't know i'm tempted I am very

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.540 
hmm i don't know i'm tempted I am very
very<00:02:08.860> very<00:02:09.069> tempted<00:02:11.010> actually<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> might<00:02:12.340> have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
very very tempted actually I might have

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.210 
very very tempted actually I might have
her<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.230> what<00:02:14.260> I'm<00:02:14.739> just<00:02:14.920> gonna<00:02:15.040> do

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
her but you know what I'm just gonna do

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.809 
her but you know what I'm just gonna do
my<00:02:15.370> original<00:02:15.819> idea<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.709> don't<00:02:17.709> care<00:02:18.099> it'll<00:02:18.519> be
