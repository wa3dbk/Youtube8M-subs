possible breaker bar in case it's too

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.049 
possible breaker bar in case it's too
tough<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.460> get<00:00:37.550> out<00:00:37.960> some<00:00:38.960> rags<00:00:39.670> fluid<00:00:40.670> pump<00:00:40.910> to

pump it up into the diff some synthetic
you<00:00:44.750> can<00:00:44.930> use<00:00:45.019> conventional<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:45.680> pray<00:00:46.239> it's

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
you can use conventional but pray it's

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.030 
you can use conventional but pray it's
real<00:00:47.390> pull<00:00:47.570> those<00:00:47.690> are<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.019> best<00:00:48.199> stuff<00:00:48.470> that

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
real pull those are the best stuff that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.779 
real pull those are the best stuff that
you<00:00:49.159> can<00:00:49.460> get<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.879> takes<00:00:50.140> 2.5<00:00:51.190> quarts<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.699> I'll

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
you can get it takes 2.5 quarts so I'll

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.150 
you can get it takes 2.5 quarts so I'll
probably<00:00:53.030> use<00:00:53.410> most<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:54.949> then

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
probably use most of it and then

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.770 
probably use most of it and then
obviously<00:00:55.309> some<00:00:55.730> rags<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.270> torque<00:00:56.570> wrench<00:00:56.809> and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
obviously some rags a torque wrench and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.709 
obviously some rags a torque wrench and
an<00:00:59.780> oil<00:00:59.989> pan<00:01:01.210> alright<00:01:02.210> right<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:02.510> I'm<00:01:02.570> just

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
an oil pan alright right now I'm just

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.930 
an oil pan alright right now I'm just
taking<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.050> truck<00:01:03.320> around<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.800> block<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.429> took

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
taking the truck around the block I took

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.859 
taking the truck around the block I took
has<00:01:05.300> about<00:01:05.539> 46,000<00:01:06.530> miles<00:01:07.570> beretta<00:01:08.570> having

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
has about 46,000 miles beretta having

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.410 
has about 46,000 miles beretta having
four<00:01:09.110> high<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.009> can<00:01:10.310> still<00:01:10.460> drive<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.030> a

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
four high so I can still drive it for a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.910 
four high so I can still drive it for a
little<00:01:11.750> bit<00:01:11.869> just<00:01:11.899> warm<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.500> front<00:01:12.710> did

little bit just warm on the front did
the<00:01:13.190> transfer<00:01:13.550> case<00:01:13.700> obviously<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.330> rear

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
the transfer case obviously the rear

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.200 
the transfer case obviously the rear
differential<00:01:14.869> we<00:01:15.140> get

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
differential we get

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.550 
differential we get
I<00:01:17.680> get<00:01:18.910> mile<00:01:19.910> from<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.330> house<00:01:20.510> I'll<00:01:21.230> just<00:01:21.380> drop

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
I get mile from the house I'll just drop

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.430 
I get mile from the house I'll just drop
it<00:01:21.770> in<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.130> low<00:01:22.780> engage<00:01:23.780> those<00:01:23.990> low<00:01:24.170> gears

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
it in the for low engage those low gears

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.650 
it in the for low engage those low gears
and<00:01:24.650> then<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:24.980> way<00:01:25.130> make<00:01:26.030> sure<00:01:26.210> Travis<00:01:26.510> case

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
and then that way make sure Travis case

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.390 
and then that way make sure Travis case
is<00:01:26.810> nice<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.170> warm<00:01:29.830> all<00:01:30.830> right<00:01:31.160> so<00:01:31.280> after

driving for about five minutes and for
hi<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.800> little<00:01:33.979> bit<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.190> for<00:01:34.460> low<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.780> go

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
hi and a little bit in for low and we go

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.160 
hi and a little bit in for low and we go
ahead<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.590> first<00:01:37.580> release<00:01:39.280> loosen<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:41.170> the

top<00:01:42.440> fill<00:01:42.740> calculated<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.400> first<00:01:43.729> because

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
top fill calculated that first because

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.870 
top fill calculated that first because
last<00:01:44.720> thing<00:01:44.810> what<00:01:45.020> happened<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.670> loosing<00:01:46.670> the

last thing what happened is loosing the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.490 
last thing what happened is loosing the
drain<00:01:47.119> plug<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.900> won't<00:01:48.080> be<00:01:48.200> able<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.410> get

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
drain plug and you won't be able to get

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.210 
drain plug and you won't be able to get
that<00:01:48.680> fill<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:50.210> fill<00:01:50.420> plug<00:01:50.600> out<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.410> let's<00:01:52.070> go

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
that fill the fill plug out so let's go

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.770 
that fill the fill plug out so let's go
ahead<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.030> right<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:55.509> drain<00:01:56.509> plug

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
ahead and do that right now drain plug

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:22.950 
ahead and do that right now drain plug
is<00:01:57.490> this<00:01:59.740> slowly

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960

in and torque it down to twenty nine
foot<00:03:35.470> pounds<00:03:36.810> which<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.050> very<00:03:38.230> much<00:03:42.090> all

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
foot pounds which is it very much all

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.930 
foot pounds which is it very much all
right<00:03:43.240> now<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.450> got<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> pump<00:03:44.580> attached<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.820> the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
right now I got the pump attached to the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.250 
right now I got the pump attached to the
quart<00:03:46.240> bottle<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.840> see<00:03:47.020> that<00:03:47.050> they

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
quart bottle and so you see that they

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.410 
quart bottle and so you see that they
kind<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.500> Prime<00:03:47.740> at<00:03:47.890> first<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.970> once<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.240> get

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
kind of Prime at first but once you get

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.260 
kind of Prime at first but once you get
