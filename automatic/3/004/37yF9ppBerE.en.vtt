00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
there's just a lot of surface rust like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:49.130 
there's just a lot of surface rust like
if<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:47.239> anyways<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> mean<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.809> really

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
too bad as you can see you know the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
too bad as you can see you know the
shiny<00:00:51.989> stuff<00:00:52.710> rotor<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> actual<00:00:53.370> bare

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
shiny stuff rotor was the actual bare

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.500 
shiny stuff rotor was the actual bare
metal<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> change<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:58.070> it's<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.190> too<00:00:59.579> hard<00:00:59.940> no

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
metal the change so it's not too hard no

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
metal the change so it's not too hard no
it's<00:01:00.660> hard<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.829> I'm

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's hard to see down in there but I'm

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.100 
it's hard to see down in there but I'm
going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.059> ahead<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> start<00:01:03.570> dumping<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
going to go ahead and start dumping the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the white distilled vinegar over here I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770 
the white distilled vinegar over here I
got<00:01:07.860> five<00:01:08.040> gallons<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:09.060> ninja<00:01:09.360> 250

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
got five gallons in it I think ninja 250

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
got five gallons in it I think ninja 250
things<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.260> 4.8<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.189> something<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
things like 4.8 or something like that

in<00:01:18.210> general<00:01:19.250> motorcycle<00:01:20.250> tanks<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.759> rust<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
in general motorcycle tanks are rust and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.130 
in general motorcycle tanks are rust and
generals<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:23.159> red<00:01:24.140> white

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
generals what I pretty much red white

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.070 
generals what I pretty much red white
vinegar<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.580> much<00:01:26.780> clean<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> off

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
vinegar will pretty much clean it off

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.460 
vinegar will pretty much clean it off
for<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:29.600> dissolve<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.320> its

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
for you know dissolve it because of its

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.370 
for you know dissolve it because of its
a<00:01:31.650> acid<00:01:32.310> content<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:34.110> you're<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a acid content so what you're going to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
a acid content so what you're going to
pretty<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.509> take<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> caps<00:01:36.930> off<00:01:38.030> dump

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pretty much do is take the caps off dump

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.020 
pretty much do is take the caps off dump
them<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:40.020> too<00:01:40.229> quickly<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.430> your

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
them in not too quickly because of your

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.179 
them in not too quickly because of your
your<00:01:42.960> tape<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.710> bottom<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
your tape down there at the bottom you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.620 
your tape down there at the bottom you
don't<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> force<00:01:45.360> on

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
don't want to you know a lot of force on

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
don't want to you know a lot of force on
it<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.829> four<00:01:47.310> gallons<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.000> probably<00:01:48.450> going

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it I know four gallons is probably going

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
it I know four gallons is probably going
to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> force<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:50.610> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
to be a lot of force on it so I'm have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
to be a lot of force on it so I'm have
to<00:01:50.850> watch<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> closely<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> don't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to watch that closely and see if I don't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.469 
to watch that closely and see if I don't
have<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:53.880> duct<00:01:54.060> tape<00:01:54.090> or

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
have to go get some duct tape or

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
have to go get some duct tape or
something<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> kind

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
something to you know something to kind

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.330 
something to you know something to kind
of<00:01:56.490> hold<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.110> maybe<00:01:58.920> I'll<00:01:59.130> have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
of hold it on there or maybe I'll have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
of hold it on there or maybe I'll have
some<00:01:59.549> way<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.049> sticking<00:02:01.049> something<00:02:01.380> under

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
some way of sticking something under

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
some way of sticking something under
that<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.340> that'll<00:02:02.759> put<00:02:02.969> pressure

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that out of there that'll put pressure

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.230 
that out of there that'll put pressure
on<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.670> yeah<00:02:05.670> i'll<00:02:05.790> show<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
on it but yeah i'll show you what it

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.429 
on it but yeah i'll show you what it
looks<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.509> whenever<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.079> filled<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
looks like whenever it's all filled up

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.089 
looks like whenever it's all filled up
and<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:08.330> probably<00:02:09.330> about<00:02:09.539> 24<00:02:09.989> hours<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.500> i'll

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and then probably about 24 hours is i'll

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.680 
and then probably about 24 hours is i'll
give<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.730> update<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> looks<00:02:12.540> like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
give you an update of what it looks like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
give you an update of what it looks like
on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.900> inside

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
on the inside

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090 
on the inside
alright<00:02:14.760> thanks<00:02:15.030> guys
