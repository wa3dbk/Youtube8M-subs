00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.890 

well<00:00:52.840> here's<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.380> fuel<00:00:54.310> pump<00:00:54.640> on<00:00:54.850> an<00:00:55.000> early<00:00:55.390> GT

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
well here's the fuel pump on an early GT

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.790 
well here's the fuel pump on an early GT
six<00:00:56.230> engine<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:57.040> was<00:00:57.760> bone-dry<00:00:58.200> on<00:00:59.200> my

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
six engine that was bone-dry on my

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.360 
six engine that was bone-dry on my
initial<00:01:00.310> attempt<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.330> start<00:01:01.630> it<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:03.160> what<00:01:03.340> I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
initial attempt to start it so what I

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.870 
initial attempt to start it so what I
did<00:01:03.490> was<00:01:04.590> install<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.650> fuel<00:01:06.070> pump<00:01:06.280> in<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.610> trunk

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
did was install a fuel pump in the trunk

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.980 
did was install a fuel pump in the trunk
let's<00:01:07.330> go<00:01:07.480> take<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.690> look<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.630> might<00:01:10.870> be<00:01:10.960> a

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
let's go take a look so might be a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.810 
let's go take a look so might be a
little<00:01:11.290> difficult<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.800> see<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
little difficult to see but there is the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.480 
little difficult to see but there is the
fuel<00:01:13.030> pump

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
fuel pump

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.430 
fuel pump
there's<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:16.229> filter<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.780> recommend<00:01:20.260> a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
there's the filter they recommend a

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.940 
there's the filter they recommend a
coarse<00:01:20.800> filter<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.640> did<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.880> fine<00:01:22.180> filter

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
coarse filter but I did a fine filter

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.600 
coarse filter but I did a fine filter
it'll<00:01:23.950> be<00:01:24.040> okay

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
it'll be okay

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.050 
it'll be okay
and<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.530> let's<00:01:26.530> get<00:01:26.680> around<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.009> wire<00:01:30.060> clean

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
and then let's get around the wire clean

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.940 
and then let's get around the wire clean
this<00:01:31.180> up<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.420> little<00:01:31.509> bit<00:01:31.660> but<00:01:32.110> as<00:01:32.590> soon<00:01:32.770> as<00:01:32.830> I

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
this up a little bit but as soon as I

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.990 
this up a little bit but as soon as I
turn<00:01:33.160> this<00:01:33.310> thing<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.900> fuel<00:01:34.900> just<00:01:35.520> shot<00:01:36.520> into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
turn this thing on fuel just shot into

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
turn this thing on fuel just shot into
that<00:01:37.890> fuel<00:01:38.890> pump<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.310> front<00:01:39.899> supposedly<00:01:40.899> you

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
that fuel pump up front supposedly you

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.859 
that fuel pump up front supposedly you
can<00:01:41.080> keep<00:01:41.380> them<00:01:41.500> both<00:01:41.680> installed<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
can keep them both installed and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.050 
can keep them both installed and
actually<00:01:43.869> unhook<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.460> only<00:01:45.640> use<00:01:45.850> it

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
actually unhook this and only use it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.690 
actually unhook this and only use it
when<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.680> cars<00:01:47.920> been<00:01:48.100> sitting<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.670> while

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
when the cars been sitting for a while

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940 
when the cars been sitting for a while
so<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.119> can<00:01:49.270> get<00:01:49.360> all<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.630> fuel<00:01:49.930> up<00:01:50.259> back<00:01:50.710> up

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
so you can get all that fuel up back up

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.370 
so you can get all that fuel up back up
to<00:01:51.190> through<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.580> system<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.960> flow<00:01:53.140> pole

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
to through the system so the flow pole

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.810 
to through the system so the flow pole
should<00:01:53.649> be<00:01:53.860> filled<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:56.640> I'll<00:01:57.640> probably

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
should be filled and I'll probably

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.260 
should be filled and I'll probably
disconnect<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:59.470> have<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.640> manual<00:02:01.000> pump

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
disconnect this and have the manual pump

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.140 
disconnect this and have the manual pump
run<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.049> engine<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.760> gonna<00:02:03.850> be<00:02:04.000> just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
run the engine so this is gonna be just

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.380 
run the engine so this is gonna be just
version<00:02:04.870> two<00:02:05.170> or<00:02:05.670> temp<00:02:06.670> two<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.119> get<00:02:07.240> this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
version two or temp two to get this

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:46.670 
version two or temp two to get this
thing<00:02:07.600> started
