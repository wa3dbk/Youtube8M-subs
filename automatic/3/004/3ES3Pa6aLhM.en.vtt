00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
for a little bit more crunch and texture

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.209 
for a little bit more crunch and texture
so<00:01:41.719> my<00:01:41.840> broth<00:01:42.049> isn't<00:01:42.439> simmering<00:01:42.770> away<00:01:42.920> for

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
so my broth isn't simmering away for

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.029 
so my broth isn't simmering away for
about<00:01:43.310> 15<00:01:43.999> 20<00:01:44.299> minutes<00:01:44.479> or<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.319> it's

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
about 15 20 minutes or so and it's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.129 
about 15 20 minutes or so and it's
originally<00:01:46.340> 5<00:01:46.789> cups<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.209> water<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:47.689> as<00:01:47.929> you

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
originally 5 cups of water but as you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.899 
originally 5 cups of water but as you
see<00:01:48.349> a<00:01:48.380> lot<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.829> has<00:01:48.950> been<00:01:48.979> evaporated<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
see a lot of it has been evaporated so

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.889 
see a lot of it has been evaporated so
not<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.149> big<00:01:50.420> deal

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
not a big deal

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.260 
not a big deal
go<00:01:51.289> ahead<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.069> take<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:52.549> out<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.789> after

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
go ahead and take this out and after

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.029 
go ahead and take this out and after
you're<00:01:53.840> done<00:01:54.020> cooking<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.469> to<00:01:54.590> throw<00:01:54.799> the

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
you're done cooking you to throw the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.279 
you're done cooking you to throw the
anchovy<00:01:55.490> fillets<00:01:55.700> right<00:01:55.909> back<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.299> my<00:01:57.079> dad

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
anchovy fillets right back in my dad

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.080 
anchovy fillets right back in my dad
loves<00:01:57.560> them<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.889> might<00:01:58.189> actually<00:01:58.369> sprinkle

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
loves them so I might actually sprinkle

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.179 
loves them so I might actually sprinkle
them<00:01:59.179> on<00:01:59.299> top<00:01:59.539> for<00:02:00.169> him<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.829> that's<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
them on top for him and that's the

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.459 
them on top for him and that's the
reason<00:02:01.429> we<00:02:01.520> took<00:02:01.669> that<00:02:01.909> extra<00:02:02.090> step<00:02:02.569> to<00:02:02.599> to<00:02:03.259> get

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
reason we took that extra step to to get

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.609 
reason we took that extra step to to get
it<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.859> tumble<00:02:04.219> in<00:02:04.609> your<00:02:04.909> rice<00:02:05.179> cake<00:02:05.599> and<00:02:05.899> it

it and tumble in your rice cake and it

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.800 
it and tumble in your rice cake and it
won't<00:02:06.799> take<00:02:07.009> very<00:02:07.039> long<00:02:07.459> at<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.660> go

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
won't take very long at all for it to go

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.469 
won't take very long at all for it to go
ahead<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.170> solve

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
ahead and solve

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.020 
ahead and solve
and<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> same<00:02:10.979> time<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.819> want<00:02:11.970> to
