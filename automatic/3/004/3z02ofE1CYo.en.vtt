00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.710
 welcome to scholarship tv in this video os 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.020
 let's propose different ways of 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.810
 combine patterns so trend 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:21.699
 this season one of the premises 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.800
 basic that you have to take into account 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.900
 is to combine on the one hand the different 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 prints and on the other the different 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 colors 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 one of the main tricks is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.650
 combining a piece with a given pattern 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 just as it is from moles streaks to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.140
 pictures or any other type with a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 plain garment that will always be a hit 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.309
 if you want to tune a bit more your 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.400
 look we recommend that you combine jce la 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.650
 garment stamped with another one of 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.620
 the colors that the printed print carries 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.629
 of the chosen company 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.030
 the jeans are very easy to combine 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.160
 that's why we suggest you use them 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.399
 as a base garment to create your light 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.949
 with print to create a look a little 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.170
 more daring we suggest you use 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.590
 different garments with the same pattern 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 but with different versions is to say yes 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.369
 you choose for example a shirt with a 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 striped print 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.930
 for example in red we propose you 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.119
 that jce combines it with a jacket that 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.670
 It is also striped but in this case 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.820
 with the stripes in another version can be 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.070
 smaller ones wider or more separated 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.600
 more together than the other garment in this 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.259
 case could be in another color that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.850
 combine such as navy blue 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.530
 another trick is to wear a garment 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.289
 with a little defined pattern or 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.450
 blurred in this case you can choose a 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.220
 dressed as pretty little spots 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.770
 scattered without being well defined and 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.350
 clear and add another garment that could 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.659
 be an American or a jacket with a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.980
 Striped floral pattern or even 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.780
 squared 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.420
 you just have to put it into practice 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.040
 choose what most suits you and create 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.170
 your look with different prints 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.170
