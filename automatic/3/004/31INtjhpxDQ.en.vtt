00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.579
 of zucchini and for that we are going to need 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.099
 now to 3 courgettes medium size cut into slices 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.429
 pradón tomato are six 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.369
 two medicines 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.009
 half 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.229
 onion 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.640
 oregano 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.860
 parsley 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.960
 there are no parties more or less 80 grams 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.750
 sugar 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 some goat cheese 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.530
 well let's first climb the tomatoes 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 if for it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.290
 we wait for 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.060
 yes we place the 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 the tomatoes 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.200
 when they start to crack 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.890
 crack 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.320
 it is a sign that they can already be removed they put cold water 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 to handle things 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 yep and you can remove the skin perfectly 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 we do not split in half 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 if we remove the losses 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 and now it is sprinkled with salt 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 sugar we will add more sugar that went out 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.520
 that finally oregano 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 enough for it to take flavor 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 later we go to the microwave 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 ten minutes to the microwave to maximum power so that it goes away taking 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.039
 for once warm the oil 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 the onion 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 with old age 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 and there we will wait a little bit until it reduces 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.409
 half-baked what we will do is add 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 the nuts 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.029
 and the garlic 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.919
 and we will only do a little 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.879
 if we leave that I feel is that it is taking little by little 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.989
 good to prepare the zucchini 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.669
 what we will do will be 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.269
 cut in half 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.039
 ends up like this in this one in this aspect 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.039
 what was we will do will be like a cheese 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.899
 Famous closes and a little bit 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.129
 and it becomes a welt squares to finish the three zucchini 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.979
 well once the zucchini is rolled 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.429
 we microwave 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 ten minutes maximum support 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.359
 next what we are going to do is simply mount the cannelloni 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.699
 that several parts will be several phases 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.789
 What we will do 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.819
 in this position 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.989
 strips 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.169
 so superimposed 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.639
 with each other 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.689
 and that was seen above all 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.549
 the part from here 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.099
 once put 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.319
 although nothing 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.169
 of eggplant 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.169
 for this part 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.309
 a little tomato 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.309
 with oregano 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.099
 and chunks piqué that 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.909
 of goat 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.819
 that inside when we local in subjects a little bit 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.729
 to the microwave 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 and finally what we will do is roll it up 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 we will put it on the plate 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
 and we will do others 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.340
 we usually have the béchamel over 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.340
 mañán double cannelloni 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.389
 that erin the bechamel 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.970
 you can find the dam in tricks of the same pages 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.830
 We were going to when placing on it 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.169
 in the microwave during 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 about two minutes just to wash a little heat 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.900
 well spent two minutes 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
