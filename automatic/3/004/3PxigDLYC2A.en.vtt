cover it with a camouflage net this
seems<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.280> work<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.580> best<00:04:41.820> for<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:43.500> covering

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889

seems to work the best for a covering
I've<00:04:44.009> tried<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.639> would<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.509> sheet<00:04:45.660> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
I've tried I would just a sheet of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.420 
I've tried I would just a sheet of
plywood<00:04:45.960> or<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.500> sheet<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.830> old<00:04:47.009> roofing<00:04:47.340> or

plywood or a sheet of old roofing or

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.749 
plywood or a sheet of old roofing or
something<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.449> it<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.750> blows<00:04:48.930> off<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:50.669> it

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
something and it just blows off and it

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.480 
something and it just blows off and it
adds<00:04:50.910> extra<00:04:51.120> weight<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.919> plywood<00:04:53.250> rots

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
adds extra weight the plywood rots

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.840 
adds extra weight the plywood rots
because<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.389> water<00:04:54.930> hasn't<00:04:55.080> run<00:04:55.289> off<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.850> the

because the water hasn't run off it the

there<00:05:16.229> if<00:05:16.320> we<00:05:16.470> choose<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.770> do<00:05:16.979> so<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.220> don't

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
there if we choose to do so you don't

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.339 
there if we choose to do so you don't
really<00:05:17.460> have<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.789> lock<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.330> because<00:05:18.930> gravity

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
really have to lock it because gravity

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.800 
really have to lock it because gravity
will<00:05:19.470> hold<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.770> closed<00:05:20.180> now<00:05:21.180> we<00:05:21.240> used<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.630> put

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
will hold it closed now we used to put

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.439 
will hold it closed now we used to put
the<00:05:21.900> door<00:05:22.050> on<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.349> bottom<00:05:23.150> coming<00:05:24.150> out<00:05:24.270> kind

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
the door on the bottom coming out kind

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.040 
the door on the bottom coming out kind
of<00:05:24.479> like<00:05:24.599> a<00:05:24.660> drawbridge<00:05:25.260> on<00:05:25.949> a<00:05:26.009> castle<00:05:27.050> that

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
of like a drawbridge on a castle that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.379 
of like a drawbridge on a castle that
didn't<00:05:28.320> work<00:05:28.380> out<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:28.680> I've<00:05:28.979> attached<00:05:29.340> just<00:05:30.300> a

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
didn't work out so I've attached just a

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.300 
didn't work out so I've attached just a
little<00:05:30.570> small<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.620> see<00:05:31.770> them<00:05:31.889> stepping<00:05:32.099> down

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
little small you see them stepping down

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.420 
little small you see them stepping down
it<00:05:32.460> there<00:05:32.639> that<00:05:33.300> works<00:05:33.479> perfect<00:05:34.190> because<00:05:35.190> with

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
it there that works perfect because with

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.430 
it there that works perfect because with
the<00:05:35.610> door<00:05:36.150> at<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.389> bottom<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.260> gets

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
the door at the bottom it just gets

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.839 
the door at the bottom it just gets
filled<00:05:37.680> with<00:05:37.800> all<00:05:38.010> kinds<00:05:38.039> of<00:05:38.340> junk<00:05:38.550> gets<00:05:38.669> in

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
filled with all kinds of junk gets in

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.839 
filled with all kinds of junk gets in
there<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.780> hinge<00:05:39.990> rots<00:05:40.229> out<00:05:40.699> and<00:05:41.699> the

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
there and the hinge rots out and the

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.560 
there and the hinge rots out and the
door<00:05:42.000> on<00:05:42.120> top<00:05:42.330> gives<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.630> matted<00:05:42.930> shade<00:05:43.139> also<00:05:44.570> so

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
door on top gives a matted shade also so

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.710 
door on top gives a matted shade also so
that's<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:47.669> type<00:05:47.849> of<00:05:47.880> model<00:05:48.270> that<00:05:48.419> I'm<00:05:48.510> using

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
that's the type of model that I'm using

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.770 
that's the type of model that I'm using
now<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:51.720> materials<00:05:52.199> it's<00:05:52.440> two<00:05:52.889> by<00:05:53.070> fours

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
now the materials it's two by fours

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.180 
now the materials it's two by fours
there's<00:05:54.780> two<00:05:54.990> by<00:05:55.110> sixes<00:05:55.500> on<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.740> bottom<00:05:56.099> and

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
there's two by sixes on the bottom and

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.570 
there's two by sixes on the bottom and
i'm<00:05:56.310> using<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.669> three-eighths<00:05:57.120> bc<00:05:57.630> plywood

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
i'm using a three-eighths bc plywood

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.750 
i'm using a three-eighths bc plywood
which<00:05:59.580> is<00:05:59.760> holding<00:06:00.060> up<00:06:00.260> surprisingly<00:06:01.260> well<00:06:01.760> I

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
which is holding up surprisingly well I

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.839 
which is holding up surprisingly well I
could<00:06:03.150> use<00:06:03.300> some<00:06:03.330> paint<00:06:04.400> preserve<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.550> longer

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
could use some paint preserve the longer

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.339 
could use some paint preserve the longer
but<00:06:05.970> we<00:06:06.120> use<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.479> three-eighths<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.110> two<00:06:07.199> by

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
but we use the three-eighths and two by

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.370 
but we use the three-eighths and two by
fours<00:06:07.909> to<00:06:08.909> save<00:06:09.150> weight<00:06:09.479> because<00:06:09.810> it's<00:06:09.840> it's

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
fours to save weight because it's it's

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.230 
fours to save weight because it's it's
tough<00:06:10.680> picking<00:06:10.979> these<00:06:11.370> next<00:06:11.669> picking<00:06:12.090> these

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
tough picking these next picking these

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.990 
tough picking these next picking these
things<00:06:12.449> up<00:06:12.570> moving<00:06:12.870> them<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.699> assist<00:06:14.699> it<00:06:14.849> you

you've<00:06:25.860> got<00:06:25.979> to<00:06:26.130> make<00:06:26.610> sure<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:26.940> birds<00:06:27.120> are

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
you've got to make sure the birds are

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.260 
you've got to make sure the birds are
inside<00:06:27.659> or<00:06:27.900> you'll<00:06:28.020> crush<00:06:28.199> them<00:06:28.409> as<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:30.000> they

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
inside or you'll crush them as the they

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.839 
inside or you'll crush them as the they
can't<00:06:30.630> run<00:06:30.750> fast<00:06:30.960> enough<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.260> keep<00:06:31.349> up<00:06:31.500> with<00:06:31.560> it

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
can't run fast enough to keep up with it

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.730 
can't run fast enough to keep up with it
so<00:06:32.849> you<00:06:32.940> lock<00:06:33.150> them<00:06:33.270> all<00:06:33.389> inside<00:06:33.599> and<00:06:34.110> you

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
so you lock them all inside and you

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.589 
so you lock them all inside and you
could<00:06:34.919> literally<00:06:35.190> move<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.610> wherever<00:06:36.330> you

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
could literally move it wherever you

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:37.940 
could literally move it wherever you
wanted<00:06:36.960> to<00:06:37.080> out<00:06:37.200> here<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.380> could<00:06:37.560> reposition

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
wanted to out here I could reposition

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.370 
wanted to out here I could reposition
anywhere<00:06:38.430> I<00:06:38.460> wanted<00:06:39.139> typically<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.229> way<00:06:40.320> we

anywhere I wanted typically the way we

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.719 
anywhere I wanted typically the way we

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.659
