just<00:01:17.939> unplug<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:20.450> when<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> purchase

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
just unplug this and when I purchase

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
just unplug this and when I purchase
these<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:22.890> reason<00:01:23.159> these<00:01:23.310> came<00:01:23.610> with

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
these for some reason these came with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.719 
these for some reason these came with
the<00:01:23.970> box<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:26.009> user<00:01:26.369> mouse

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the box so you can use your user mouse

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
the box so you can use your user mouse
your<00:01:26.909> mp3<00:01:27.509> player<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.860> phone<00:01:29.130> or

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
your mp3 player or your phone or

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.929 
your mp3 player or your phone or
whatever<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> 3.5<00:01:30.360> millimeter<00:01:31.259> jack

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
whatever it has a 3.5 millimeter jack

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.840 
whatever it has a 3.5 millimeter jack
and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:34.040> since<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> has<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.579> three

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and I think since it has like three

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
and I think since it has like three
lengths<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> thing<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
lengths here a thing you can use this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.850 
lengths here a thing you can use this
that's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.700> headset<00:01:39.119> 2<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.720> phone<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that's a headset 2 for your phone so you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.469 
that's a headset 2 for your phone so you
can<00:01:41.009> probably<00:01:41.189> listen<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> music<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can probably listen to music or you can

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.719 
can probably listen to music or you can
say<00:01:42.630> calls<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.100> should<00:01:44.340> work<00:01:44.520> does

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
say calls and I think should work does

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
say calls and I think should work does
it<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> three<00:01:45.899> lines<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it have like one to three lines the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
it have like one to three lines the
thing<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.009> work<00:01:47.280> nothing<00:01:47.939> right<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
thing to work nothing right and the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.969 
thing to work nothing right and the
other<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> speaker<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
other one for the speaker but if you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880 
other one for the speaker but if you
want<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> set<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.030> xbox<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:55.530> also

this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.399> favorite<00:01:56.820> part<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this is my favorite part for this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.679 
this is my favorite part for this
because<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.229> has<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:59.030> tiny<00:02:00.030> connector

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
because it has a little tiny connector

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
because it has a little tiny connector
right<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> controller<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
right there for the controller so you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
right there for the controller so you
