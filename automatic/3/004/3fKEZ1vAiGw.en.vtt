in<00:00:09.780> adobe<00:00:10.410> captivate<00:00:10.590> 6<00:00:11.040> now<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.210> group

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
in adobe captivate 6 now we can group

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.070 
in adobe captivate 6 now we can group
objects<00:00:13.200> together<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.719> not<00:00:15.900> only

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
objects together so that we can not only

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
objects together so that we can not only
organized<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> stage<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.150> also<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
organized it on the stage but also it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.189 
organized it on the stage but also it
can<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.050> organized<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> timeline<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:22.020> do

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
can be organized in the timeline to do

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
can be organized in the timeline to do
the<00:00:22.410> grouping<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.240> multi<00:00:24.630> select

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the grouping we have to do multi select

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.370 
the grouping we have to do multi select
of<00:00:25.260> objects<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:27.000> case<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.480> am<00:00:27.539> selecting

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
of objects in this case I am selecting

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.359 
of objects in this case I am selecting
the<00:00:28.740> title<00:00:29.640> text<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.380> flower<00:00:31.740> images

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the title text and all the flower images

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.440 
the title text and all the flower images
and<00:00:32.690> then<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> edit<00:00:35.520> menu<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> group

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and then I can go to edit menu and group

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.450 
and then I can go to edit menu and group
or<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:38.010> always<00:00:38.809> press<00:00:39.809> ctrl<00:00:40.350> +<00:00:40.590> G<00:00:41.280> keys

or I can always press ctrl + G keys
groupid<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.559> once<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.190> grouped<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.239> can

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
groupid now once it is grouped I can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
groupid now once it is grouped I can
change<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> properties<00:00:50.550> for

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
change some of the properties for

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.420 
change some of the properties for
example<00:00:51.410> let<00:00:52.410> me<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.829> name<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.870> flower

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
example let me just name this as flower

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
example let me just name this as flower
and<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:58.250> can<00:00:59.270> have<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.570> shadow<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.199> reflection

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and I can have the shadow and reflection

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670 
and I can have the shadow and reflection
properties<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> group<00:01:02.910> once<00:01:03.780> i<00:01:04.019> give<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
properties for the group once i give the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.149 
properties for the group once i give the
shadow<00:01:04.920> detection<00:01:05.479> properties<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
shadow detection properties all the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.480 
shadow detection properties all the
objects<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.810> group<00:01:10.200> gets<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.430> property

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
objects in that group gets this property

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
objects in that group gets this property
next<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:15.659> even<00:01:16.369> transform<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
next I can even transform all the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
next I can even transform all the
objects<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.380> once<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.939> transformation

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
objects at once but this transformation

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
objects at once but this transformation
gets<00:01:22.110> affected<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> crew<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:24.150> example<00:01:25.310> if<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
gets affected as a crew for example if I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
gets affected as a crew for example if I
am<00:01:26.549> rotating<00:01:27.020> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.380> observe<00:01:28.700> all<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
am rotating if you observe all the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.679 
am rotating if you observe all the
objects<00:01:30.659> gets<00:01:31.290> rotated<00:01:32.329> within<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> group

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
objects gets rotated within the group

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
objects gets rotated within the group
right<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.850> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.770> select<00:01:37.770> an

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
right what if I want to select an

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.999 
right what if I want to select an
individual<00:01:38.490> object<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:39.689> simple<00:01:40.110> once<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
individual object very simple once you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.359 
individual object very simple once you
select<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> group<00:01:41.990> then<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.020> next<00:01:43.649> click<00:01:44.130> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
select the group then the next click on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
select the group then the next click on
the<00:01:44.579> object<00:01:44.780> would<00:01:45.780> select<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.740> individual

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the object would select that individual

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
the object would select that individual
object<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> properties<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
object and all the properties for that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.179 
object and all the properties for that
objects<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.790> changed<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.890> if<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
objects can be changed as if it's a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.920 
objects can be changed as if it's a
single<00:01:53.790> entity<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:56.399> this

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
single entity just this

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.500 
single entity just this
this<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:58.100> let's<00:01:58.670> take<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.060> look<00:01:59.210> at<00:01:59.330> the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
this now let's take a look at the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.200 
this now let's take a look at the
timeline<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.600> timeline<00:02:02.900> if<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.920> observe

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
timeline in the timeline if you observe

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.300 
timeline in the timeline if you observe
there<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.330> no<00:02:05.660> more<00:02:05.840> cluttering<00:02:06.380> as<00:02:06.680> before

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
there is no more cluttering as before

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.389 
there is no more cluttering as before
now<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.390> easily<00:02:08.720> collapse<00:02:09.560> all<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.160> group

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
now we can easily collapse all the group

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.380 
now we can easily collapse all the group
items<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.120> then<00:02:11.410> arrange<00:02:12.410> them<00:02:13.240> according<00:02:14.240> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
items and then arrange them according to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.070 
items and then arrange them according to
our<00:02:14.510> needs<00:02:15.160> let's<00:02:16.160> quickly<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.870> more

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
our needs let's quickly make one more

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.660 
our needs let's quickly make one more
group<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.140> animals<00:02:21.650> let<00:02:22.490> me

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
group that is for the animals let me

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.370 
group that is for the animals let me
just<00:02:22.820> select<00:02:23.450> all<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.459> objects<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:27.230> are

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
just select all the objects which are

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.970 
just select all the objects which are
ungrouped<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.780> group<00:02:29.780> them<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.530> time<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:30.950> am

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
ungrouped and group them this time I am

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.270 
ungrouped and group them this time I am
pressing<00:02:31.570> ctrl<00:02:32.570> +<00:02:32.870> G<00:02:33.260> key<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.540> gets

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
pressing ctrl + G key and this gets

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.020 
pressing ctrl + G key and this gets
group<00:02:37.280> now<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.650> let<00:02:40.010> me<00:02:40.220> name<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.760> as

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
group now and let me name this as

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.890 
group now and let me name this as
animals<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:45.250> even<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.550> timeline<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.420> can

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
animals and even the timeline I can

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.470 
animals and even the timeline I can
collapse<00:02:48.230> all<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.950> layers<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> animals

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
collapse all the layers of the animals

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.540 
collapse all the layers of the animals
and<00:02:50.750> then<00:02:52.959> organize<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.260> timeline<00:02:55.870> now<00:02:57.550> in

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
and then organize the timeline now in

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.820 
and then organize the timeline now in
the<00:02:58.820> timeline<00:02:59.090> if<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.840> want<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.110> show<00:03:00.320> any<00:03:00.620> of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
the timeline if you want to show any of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.750 
the timeline if you want to show any of
the<00:03:01.280> objects<00:03:02.150> within<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.810> group<00:03:03.220> then<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.610> will

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
the objects within a group then you will

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.979 
the objects within a group then you will
have<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.410> hide<00:03:06.410> entire<00:03:07.269> group<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.840> will

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
have to hide entire group and you will

slide they were actually placeholders

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.660 
slide they were actually placeholders
and<00:06:58.630> then<00:06:58.990> I<00:06:59.200> converted<00:06:59.710> them<00:07:00.010> as<00:07:00.220> a<00:07:00.340> text

caption let's select these two and see

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.700

whether<00:07:05.650> I<00:07:05.800> can<00:07:05.950> group<00:07:06.640> them<00:07:07.200> go<00:07:08.200> to<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.410> Edit

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
whether I can group them go to the Edit

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.960 
whether I can group them go to the Edit
menu<00:07:08.740> and<00:07:09.310> if<00:07:09.670> you<00:07:09.700> are<00:07:09.880> serve<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.900> group

option<00:07:12.970> is<00:07:13.290> disabled<00:07:14.290> what<00:07:15.130> does<00:07:15.280> that<00:07:15.400> mean

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
option is disabled what does that mean

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.320 
option is disabled what does that mean
that<00:07:15.880> means<00:07:16.270> if<00:07:17.200> you<00:07:17.410> have<00:07:17.620> an<00:07:17.770> object<00:07:18.330> which

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
that means if you have an object which

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.710 
that means if you have an object which
you<00:07:19.960> have<00:07:20.200> achieved<00:07:20.440> by<00:07:21.630> converting<00:07:22.630> a

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
you have achieved by converting a

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.260 
you have achieved by converting a
placeholder<00:07:23.130> those<00:07:24.130> objects<00:07:24.760> cannot<00:07:25.060> be

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
placeholder those objects cannot be

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.920 
placeholder those objects cannot be
grouped<00:07:25.540> that's<00:07:26.350> for<00:07:26.530> the<00:07:26.620> reason<00:07:27.040> that<00:07:27.930> if

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
grouped that's for the reason that if

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.100 
grouped that's for the reason that if
you<00:07:29.230> are<00:07:29.260> applying<00:07:29.860> a<00:07:30.130> theme<00:07:31.080> which<00:07:32.080> is

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
you are applying a theme which is

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.960 
you are applying a theme which is
different<00:07:32.650> than<00:07:32.920> the<00:07:33.280> current<00:07:33.460> one<00:07:33.670> a

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
different than the current one a

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.750 
different than the current one a
different<00:07:34.420> theme<00:07:34.960> then<00:07:35.800> all<00:07:36.100> those

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
different theme then all those

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.420 
different theme then all those
placeholder<00:07:37.390> objects<00:07:37.930> gets<00:07:38.200> mapped<00:07:38.620> to<00:07:39.040> the

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430 
placeholder objects gets mapped to the

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.750 
placeholder objects gets mapped to the
new<00:07:39.640> thing<00:07:39.880> and<00:07:40.780> if<00:07:41.350> you<00:07:41.590> have<00:07:41.800> grouped<00:07:42.340> them

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:42.760 
new thing and if you have grouped them

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.050 
new thing and if you have grouped them
then<00:07:43.630> that<00:07:43.960> mapping<00:07:44.800> may<00:07:45.430> not<00:07:45.610> work<00:07:45.850> properly

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
then that mapping may not work properly

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.010 
then that mapping may not work properly
and<00:07:46.570> thus<00:07:47.290> the<00:07:47.440> reason<00:07:47.470> we<00:07:47.950> have<00:07:48.100> disabled

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
and thus the reason we have disabled

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.770 
and thus the reason we have disabled
grouping<00:07:50.020> of<00:07:51.210> placeholder<00:07:52.210> converted

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:52.780 
grouping of placeholder converted

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.110 
grouping of placeholder converted
