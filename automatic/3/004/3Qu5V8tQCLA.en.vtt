00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
so things that these ng fx4 is a really

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.180 
so things that these ng fx4 is a really
good<00:04:49.699> blend<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.380> some<00:04:51.380> really<00:04:51.710> crazy<00:04:51.889> out

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190

there stuff and nice solid C on C like
this<00:04:54.650> one<00:04:59.020> that's<00:05:00.020> pretty<00:05:00.289> good

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.520 

so<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:12.150> got<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> most<00:05:12.450> expressive<00:05:12.750> wah<00:05:13.170> pedal

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
so it's got a most expressive wah pedal

quite<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> lot<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.520> program<00:05:14.820> ability<00:05:15.210> as<00:05:15.360> you

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
quite a lot of program ability as you

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.450 
quite a lot of program ability as you
can<00:05:15.630> see<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.960> pretty<00:05:16.290> much<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.710> arranged<00:05:17.310> into

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
can see it pretty much is arranged into

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.240 
can see it pretty much is arranged into
three<00:05:17.730> analog<00:05:18.120> style<00:05:18.390> pedals<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.250> sequence

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
three analog style pedals in sequence

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.800 
three analog style pedals in sequence
they<00:05:20.490> switch<00:05:20.880> between<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.420> individual

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
they switch between the individual

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.360 
they switch between the individual
pedals<00:05:21.990> for<00:05:22.260> those<00:05:22.410> buttons<00:05:22.740> they're<00:05:22.980> change

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
pedals for those buttons they're change

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.660 
pedals for those buttons they're change
your<00:05:24.080> particular<00:05:25.080> type<00:05:25.470> of<00:05:25.650> pedal<00:05:25.800> using<00:05:26.550> this

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
your particular type of pedal using this

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.370 
your particular type of pedal using this
set<00:05:26.880> of<00:05:26.970> buttons<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.840> parameters<00:05:28.290> of

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
set of buttons and the parameters of

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.430 
set of buttons and the parameters of
each<00:05:28.440> pedal<00:05:28.680> with<00:05:28.920> these<00:05:29.040> buttons<00:05:30.440> simply

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
each pedal with these buttons simply

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.530 
each pedal with these buttons simply
unit<00:05:31.740> great<00:05:32.160> sounds<00:05:32.840> compact<00:05:33.840> excellent
