00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.360
 she where everyone then we have you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 talked about hashtag drive clubs already in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 up and down 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 we told you about forza motorsport at 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 present with revol the friend of the wheel of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.490
 services of all that rolls on you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.560
 do a little comparative of the two a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 small not necessarily a versus our 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.099
 comparative and a comparative since 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.660
 the orientation and dojo is not all about 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.490
 does the same but good as these are 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.779
 two racing games coming out will be 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.949
 available at launch and consoles 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 therefore de rigueur 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 ps side 4 is out at five side xbox one 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.649
 we still thought it wise to talk to you 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 from them and confront them 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 even though again almost but 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.940
 more arcade anyway and forza more 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 simulation even though both have a small 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 simulation side for in a club even 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 if inquiry side for forza indre f2 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 story that reinvents a little bit of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.110
 multiplayer since roughly speaking for 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 take an example you go online on 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.559
 a race on a waiter you make your turn 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 little grill alone you think you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.739
 es painard and makes other players 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 at the same time do the same thing as you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 you can not see them but you know what 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.659
 that they make you for example you arrive 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 on a portion we tell you there is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.140
 michel or jean-claude then on this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 portion did 150 miles per hour of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 mean and tries to beat him and kill his 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 little picture more is who is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.560
 funny is that you recognize him 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.670
 on the picture where probably the hashtag 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.270
 in the title moreover exactly 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 it's very community and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.570
 and therefore if you beat earns points 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.899
 if you do not fight me you do not win 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.900
 points but after one hour of play 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.700
 there is a ranking that establishes and 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.780
 reboot points after one hour and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.230
 so this is a new session that 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.910
 are linked 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.860
 it's not just questions of 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.800
 average 2 km hour on a serving 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.360
 there is also drift on 4.5 turns 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.130
 we say to ourselves here is Michel who did 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.540
 700 brest points on these mirages 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.250
 try to beat him and that's to win 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.700
 points it is very clean xp of the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.660
 reputation and creating clubs with 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.980
 other pilots 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.180
 in fact you create your club studies and 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.860
 recruit they can come and go 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.000
 of the club as they want you 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.380
 unlock cars with your 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.480
 reputation so it's pretty damn good 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 you were going to say something no I was going to say 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.630
 who is this michel is a guy that I 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.850
 often take on the servers of all 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.310
 the web server racing games to which 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.720
 is okay and so forza more 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.440
 oriented simulation for the blow to 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 level news is a little bit 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.900
 not disappointed but let's say who has not 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.180
 a lot of things in the gameplay that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.340
 rest of the forza like that is a game 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.100
 who wants to be hardcore if you wish 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.880
 and accessible if you wish 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.560
 always the possibility to activate 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.630
 disable quite a few years of the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.070
 ideal trajectory control decline 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.510
 traction 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.620
 but where you really feel a new 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.690
 generation these charts sell 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.450
 unlike a dress club that is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.940
 35% development is disgusting there 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.080
 must say it ah ok it's done here said 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.519
 here it is full of aliasing 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
 frankly it's not at the level of the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.170
 ps4 as much force to him the loans he 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.630
 could go out tomorrow it's good it's 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.519
 it's ok cars are beautiful 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.959
 you always have the possibility of solid 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.030
 adventure in main menu to turn 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.610
 around the report of mounting inside 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.900
 to start the engine is frankly 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.440
 visually it's the next-gen what 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.019
 if there is zero clipping you have access 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.459
 really to all the game 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.200
 graphically no matter where 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.150
 what are the funds 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
 are not ugly are not disgusting them 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.630
 textures bass not his fine features and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.730
 very detailed the audience also very 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.840
 credible it's almost a model like 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.209
 a real character 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.489
 so it's again visually 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.110
 it sends sends heavy to the level 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.700
 gameplay it's not very very very 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.170
 original for now but it's a 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.879
 jury that will have a lot of strength 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 also for online since the 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.700
 community side coach is going to be very 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.379
 important if we have to give a trend 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.069
 I would say that Fordian is much more 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.530
 high point today 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.540
 that of dreams club funds to is ready to 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 go out and forza will satisfy the fans of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.230
 forza not slave us a new 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.180
 license they have to read them the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.260
 players it's not easy it's going 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.069
 seduce players who like 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.180
 play in multi after i'm not sure 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.230
 that they seduce the fans of gran 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.970
 turismo because it is not enough 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.110
 pointed at the opponent so that's it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.940
 remains to a bigger tourism 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.700
 exactly and I'm not sure no 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.310
 more that seduce fans of 2 td had 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.400
 for example but it's closer to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.989
 tdu2 that gran turismo so brief yesterday 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.660
 a small reserve but a big 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.950
 potential and funds abbas and a demo 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.569
 technological what is a game that is 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.829
 absolutely beautiful so a game 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.959
 perfect showcase for a launch of 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.459
 machines is necessarily a dresscode that 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.260
 is far from being over so he 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.269
 there is still everything to prove and believed 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.310
 in him here for this little point 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.960
 racing game next gen on is a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.220
 later for new adventures 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 hi ciao
