industry spray drying and air drying or
large<00:01:08.860> scale<00:01:09.330> technologies<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.509> are

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
large scale technologies that are

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.140 
large scale technologies that are
continuous<00:01:11.290> they're<00:01:11.710> very<00:01:12.070> very<00:01:12.580> efficient

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
continuous they're very very efficient

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.899 
continuous they're very very efficient
they<00:01:13.270> do<00:01:13.330> large<00:01:13.720> throughputs<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
they do large throughputs and the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.490 
they do large throughputs and the
difficulty<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:16.540> those<00:01:16.720> technologies<00:01:17.049> is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
difficulty with those technologies is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.520 
difficulty with those technologies is
that<00:01:17.619> expose<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.400> materials<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:19.390> both<00:01:19.780> heat

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
that expose the materials to both heat

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.550 
that expose the materials to both heat
and<00:01:20.560> oxygen<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:22.150> tends<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.720> damage<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
and oxygen which tends to damage the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.090 
and oxygen which tends to damage the
flavors<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.280> nutrients<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.570> colors<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.920> they

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
flavors and nutrients the colors so they

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.950 
flavors and nutrients the colors so they
can't<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.579> used<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:28.060> all<00:01:28.180> applications

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
can't be used in all applications

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.929 
can't be used in all applications
particularly<00:01:29.350> heat<00:01:29.740> sensitive<00:01:30.189> ones<00:01:30.430> so

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
particularly heat sensitive ones so

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
different applications if you look at

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.010 
different applications if you look at
historically<00:06:01.060> companies<00:06:01.660> that<00:06:01.840> are

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
historically companies that are

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.620 
historically companies that are
positioned<00:06:02.800> with<00:06:03.060> disruptive<00:06:04.060> technology

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
positioned with disruptive technology

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.360 
positioned with disruptive technology
very<00:06:04.900> large<00:06:05.229> market<00:06:05.710> sectors<00:06:06.070> which<00:06:06.250> I

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
very large market sectors which I

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.330 
very large market sectors which I
believe<00:06:06.639> we<00:06:06.850> are<00:06:07.289> they<00:06:08.289> can<00:06:08.440> be<00:06:08.560> successful<00:06:09.190> at

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
believe we are they can be successful at

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.490 
believe we are they can be successful at
bringing<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.320> commercialization<00:06:11.320> of<00:06:11.440> that

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
bringing the commercialization of that

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.450 
bringing the commercialization of that
into<00:06:12.070> wide<00:06:12.310> ranges<00:06:12.880> of<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.750> market<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:15.280> can

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
into wide ranges of the market you can

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.550 
into wide ranges of the market you can
see<00:06:15.669> very<00:06:15.940> very<00:06:16.210> good<00:06:16.360> valuation<00:06:16.750> potential

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
see very very good valuation potential

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.770 
see very very good valuation potential
and<00:06:18.280> I<00:06:18.370> believe<00:06:18.700> that<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.240> fact<00:06:19.479> that<00:06:19.600> we've

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
and I believe that the fact that we've

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.710 
and I believe that the fact that we've
attracted<00:06:20.050> some<00:06:20.680> very<00:06:20.889> high<00:06:21.130> quality

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
attracted some very high quality

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.690 
attracted some very high quality
potential<00:06:22.720> partners<00:06:23.169> we're<00:06:24.100> showing<00:06:24.340> that<00:06:24.610> we

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
potential partners we're showing that we

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.730 
potential partners we're showing that we
can<00:06:24.729> build<00:06:25.090> commercial<00:06:25.900> scale<00:06:26.169> industrial

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
can build commercial scale industrial

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.190 
can build commercial scale industrial
scale<00:06:27.190> technology<00:06:27.850> I<00:06:28.090> think<00:06:28.570> it's<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.780> big<00:06:28.960> step

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
scale technology I think it's a big step

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.250 
scale technology I think it's a big step
for<00:06:29.590> us<00:06:29.620> in<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:29.889> right<00:06:30.039> direction<00:06:30.100> and<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:31.600> we

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
for us in the right direction and and we

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.980 
for us in the right direction and and we
really<00:06:33.250> have<00:06:33.430> such<00:06:33.820> a<00:06:33.850> wide<00:06:34.210> diversity<00:06:34.479> of

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
really have such a wide diversity of

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.629 
really have such a wide diversity of
risk<00:06:35.410> because<00:06:35.800> we<00:06:35.950> have<00:06:36.130> so<00:06:36.310> many<00:06:36.430> different

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
risk because we have so many different

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.010 
risk because we have so many different
areas<00:06:36.880> we're<00:06:37.180> testing<00:06:37.599> that<00:06:37.750> you're<00:06:37.900> not

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
areas we're testing that you're not

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.270 
areas we're testing that you're not
relying<00:06:38.409> as<00:06:38.650> an<00:06:38.770> investor

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
relying as an investor

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.540 
relying as an investor
only<00:06:39.520> one<00:06:39.730> area<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.240> at<00:06:41.230> the<00:06:41.320> same<00:06:41.530> time<00:06:41.800> many

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
only one area and at the same time many

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.520 
only one area and at the same time many
of<00:06:42.700> our<00:06:42.910> partners<00:06:43.510> have<00:06:43.870> multiple<00:06:44.350> areas

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
of our partners have multiple areas

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.590 
of our partners have multiple areas
where<00:06:44.830> we<00:06:44.980> see<00:06:45.160> them<00:06:45.340> been<00:06:45.670> able<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.300> use<00:06:46.450> the

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
where we see them been able to use the

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.830 
where we see them been able to use the
technology<00:06:47.170> so<00:06:48.160> we've<00:06:48.490> got<00:06:49.030> an<00:06:49.150> opportunity

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
technology so we've got an opportunity

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.540 
technology so we've got an opportunity
that<00:06:49.870> could<00:06:50.380> be<00:06:50.560> very<00:06:50.590> very<00:06:51.010> large<00:06:51.220> a<00:06:51.400> scale

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
that could be very very large a scale

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.670 
that could be very very large a scale
and<00:06:52.000> if<00:06:52.389> our<00:06:52.510> royalty<00:06:52.930> method<00:06:53.410> can<00:06:53.650> be

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
and if our royalty method can be

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.620 
and if our royalty method can be
successfully<00:06:54.639> implemented<00:06:55.120> across<00:06:55.360> these

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
successfully implemented across these

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.510 
successfully implemented across these
different<00:06:55.690> areas<00:06:56.260> it<00:06:56.440> also<00:06:56.800> gives<00:06:57.040> a<00:06:57.340> chance

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
different areas it also gives a chance

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.000 
different areas it also gives a chance
for<00:06:57.910> very<00:06:58.180> high<00:06:58.330> merge<00:06:58.570> and<00:06:58.840> revenue<00:06:59.680> streams

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
for very high merge and revenue streams

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.310 
for very high merge and revenue streams
which<00:07:00.280> is<00:07:00.460> very<00:07:00.669> very<00:07:00.820> important<00:07:01.360> so<00:07:02.200> we

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
which is very very important so we

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.800 
which is very very important so we
believe<00:07:02.470> we<00:07:02.919> are<00:07:02.950> now<00:07:03.310> as<00:07:03.730> we<00:07:04.240> complete<00:07:04.450> the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
believe we are now as we complete the

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.540 
believe we are now as we complete the
vendor<00:07:05.139> acquisitions<00:07:05.800> well<00:07:06.070> I'm<00:07:06.190> going<00:07:06.340> to<00:07:06.400> be

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
vendor acquisitions well I'm going to be

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.640 
vendor acquisitions well I'm going to be
clearly<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.330> world's<00:07:07.780> leading<00:07:08.020> company<00:07:08.620> in

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
clearly the world's leading company in

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.120 
clearly the world's leading company in
the<00:07:09.520> development<00:07:10.150> of<00:07:10.650> vacuum<00:07:11.650> microwave

the development of vacuum microwave

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.400 
the development of vacuum microwave
technology<00:07:12.340> and<00:07:13.330> we<00:07:13.540> believe<00:07:13.870> this<00:07:14.050> kind<00:07:14.320> of

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
technology and we believe this kind of

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.500 
technology and we believe this kind of
technology<00:07:14.800> is<00:07:15.280> poised<00:07:15.669> to<00:07:15.669> really<00:07:16.300> break
