00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.979
 to the people as they are today I'm going to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 record a video on how to download 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:15.120
 free hypo book points 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 me because I noticed that the page 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
 many people do not know how to do it or 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 they have doubts out there and they put me 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.099
 questions also of this in me in my 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.560
 youtube channel so it's good 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's start the page first 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 is www uve punto 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.750
 and paul free 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.830
 Y 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.990
 whatever the page I'm going to put it 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.990
 in in the comments 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.480
 Upon entering the first page 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.650
 let's see it to know there's the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.720
 books that are available then 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.620
 but the truth is a little bit annoying 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.680
 way in which these books are downloaded 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.060
 I do not know why they 're doing it like that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.640
 I want to think that it is for reasons of 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 and get money to continue with 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 the project who knows but 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.229
 I'm going to tell you how to do it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.860
 well let's suppose we want to lower 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.350
 this 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 where game of thrones we click 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.330
 of the book and this appears 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.520
 and here 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 Well, the information of the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.130
 book 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.600
 here is this tells us to be free what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 checked or not 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 if we click here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.909
 we can see it open our page but 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.409
 with this we can see the complete saga 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.409
 is the rest of the bleus 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.140
 but if we go down this book 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.920
 by downloading it click here 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 this taste 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.110
 exe file here says it's magnet link 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.720
 I do not know why they have not changed 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.850
 previously if it was downloaded like that or 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.430
 a torrent file was downloaded and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.800
 automatically be added here and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 you could download then the two files 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.420
 directly now it is no longer low now 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.420
 an exe file like this 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.040
 then what are we going to do so 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 let's open the file let's go to the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.010
 folder where it was saved 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.880
 what is 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 is the goat 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.380
 many people in the forums of the page 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.650
 Free book point I was thought to be a 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.350
 virus is not a virus what you can is 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.870
 that apparently the people on the page 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.849
 free youtube 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.159
 I want to think what somehow 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.880
 they are paid to put the books 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.850
 in this way because he asks you to 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.580
 ins such as a bar 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.090
 tools for windows explores the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 explorer 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.430
 of internet then good 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.430
 here we will give double click 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.360
 we put that if it's not like it's 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.810
 install something but will not install anything 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.810
 our by 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.790
 and us the information appears with lake 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.620
 MerÃ­n here says it's going to install 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.359
 but it is not nothing installation 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.800
 if you read the information here it says 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.680
 what 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.060
 nothing really installs here in 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.610
 this we give next 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.530
 here is very important if you what 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.140
 they leave so nothing else they give you next they 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.230
 they install these things here the the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.680
 title board will be put on the page by 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.110
 defect all this because we do not want it 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.720
 we simply click on it to remove 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.970
 this 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.220
 this what would have been installed but 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.390
 well we see it here that we have this 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.450
 the following and here 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.010
 we give him cancer because if we give him ok 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.340
 as it wants to be installed then we give it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.150
 Cancer 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.150
 we put you not 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.910
 here we choose where we want it to enter 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.370
 quotes to install in what we are 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.799
 downloading that I repeat nothing 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.549
 install our puree to suppose here in 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.549
 the desk 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.280
 according to this is already 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.080
 that opens where it is kept we must 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.889
 finish and here is the torrent file 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.889
 simply double click 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.520
 it is added 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.319
 to our torrent downloads 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.479
 already with this because nothing else would be 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:54.080
 wait for it to finish download the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.780
 book and this one we will be able to see in the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.340
 folder where we keep it as they 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.080
 I say it is very important I know that it can 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.940
 become annoying but look no 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.699
 this way the people of free ebook 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.500
 point tells me that it was downloaded look at the 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.889
 in this way the people of free point 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.330
 I do not charge for the service of being 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.120
 downloading and storing the books there 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.840
 same then if this somehow 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.520
 they help them raise funds for 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.400
 continue with this project because what better 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.080
 it's not costing us anything 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.789
 simply that we have to follow some 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.480
 how many more steps to download 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.250
 a book is everything 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.740

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.950
 folder we have double click and here is 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.950
 the book 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.190
 as you can see is a file with the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.200
 extension and pop 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.600
 and nothing else they open it with a reader 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.110
 of ebooks that I have in this case 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.110

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.220

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.300
