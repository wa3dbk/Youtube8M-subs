borehole mapping and we have took the
many<00:01:03.300> samples<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> borewells<00:01:04.290> water

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
many samples of the borewells water

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
many samples of the borewells water
groundwater<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.939> took<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> eye

groundwater and we have took to the eye

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
groundwater and we have took to the eye
and<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.930> where<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.260> used<00:01:07.860> tear<00:01:08.250> up

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and see where we have used tear up

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
and see where we have used tear up
Chandra<00:01:08.850> biological<00:01:09.500> where<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:11.010> took
