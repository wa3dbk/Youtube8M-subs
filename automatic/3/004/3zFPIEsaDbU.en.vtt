00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
to be the safer way of convoy now I

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.039 
to be the safer way of convoy now I
don't<00:00:12.179> know<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.540> any<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.259> other<00:00:13.559> than

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
don't know if any of you other than

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.910 
don't know if any of you other than
obviously<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.170> those<00:00:16.320> efforts<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
obviously all those efforts for that

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.929 
obviously all those efforts for that
I've<00:00:17.190> seen<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.230> pvp<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.550> yeah<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
I've seen this on the pvp so yeah and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.470 
I've seen this on the pvp so yeah and
it's<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.320> simple<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> combo<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.730> which<00:00:24.240> is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
it's a simple way of combo in which is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000 
it's a simple way of combo in which is
probably<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> biggest<00:00:25.289> way<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> calm<00:00:25.769> wind

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
probably the biggest way of calm wind

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.540 
probably the biggest way of calm wind
now<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.910> why<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.170> my
