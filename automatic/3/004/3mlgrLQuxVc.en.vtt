got only four kills that's all so it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.180 
got only four kills that's all so it
does<00:02:46.599> fall<00:02:47.200> out<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.530> down<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.830> for<00:02:47.950> no

does fall out for it down there for no

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.220 
does fall out for it down there for no
apparent<00:02:48.700> reason<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.599> does<00:02:49.780> start<00:02:49.989> getting

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
apparent reason so it does start getting

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.370 
apparent reason so it does start getting
really<00:02:50.590> really<00:02:50.739> action-packed<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.380> starts
