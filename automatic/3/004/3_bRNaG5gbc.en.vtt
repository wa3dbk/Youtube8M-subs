this<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.769> well<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.730> thought<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> brand<00:00:12.570> new

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this I well I thought it was a brand new

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.250 
this I well I thought it was a brand new
model<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.950> back<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.460> says<00:00:14.730> um<00:00:15.260> 2009

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
model but on the back it says um 2009

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.590 
model but on the back it says um 2009
Gemini<00:00:16.650> Jets<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.240> thought<00:00:18.420> they

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
Gemini Jets which I just thought they

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
Gemini Jets which I just thought they
just<00:00:18.840> released<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.500> apparently<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.400> wrong

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
just released but apparently I'm wrong

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.170 
just released but apparently I'm wrong
but<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.210> believe<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.720> they<00:00:22.199> were<00:00:23.180> these

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
but I believe that they were these

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.609 
but I believe that they were these
planes<00:00:24.449> were<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.810> released<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> come<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
planes were just released to come with

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.029 
planes were just released to come with
you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
you
so<00:00:26.939> here's<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> plane<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.960> his<00:00:28.170> oldest<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
so here's the plane in his oldest that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
so here's the plane in his oldest that
this<00:00:29.039> plane<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.609> dedicated<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.420> little

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this plane is dedicated to my little

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.780 
this plane is dedicated to my little
brother<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.230> well<00:00:32.160> he<00:00:32.340> bought<00:00:32.520> me<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
brother because well he bought me it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
brother because well he bought me it
because<00:00:33.210> he<00:00:33.390> broke<00:00:33.899> another<00:00:34.290> plane<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.920> was

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
because he broke another plane that was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.310 
because he broke another plane that was
really<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.660> nice<00:00:36.660> day<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> dedicated

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
plane I actually saw this plane when I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
plane I actually saw this plane when I
was<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.860> Frankfurt<00:01:05.430> Germany<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.390> couple

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
was in Frankfurt Germany just a couple

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
was in Frankfurt Germany just a couple
weeks<00:01:07.020> ago<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.520> parked<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
weeks ago and it was like parked at the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.870 
weeks ago and it was like parked at the
gate<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.310> closet<00:01:11.310> doors<00:01:11.460> open

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
gate like this with closet doors open

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480 
gate like this with closet doors open
and<00:01:12.030> everything<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:13.200> plane<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.950> wheels<00:01:14.250> do

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and everything this plane the wheels do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310 
and everything this plane the wheels do
roll<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.240> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> happy<00:01:15.630> about<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
roll and I'm kind of happy about that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.249 
roll and I'm kind of happy about that
but<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.860> wouldn't<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.030> much

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
but I wouldn't really do that that much

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
but I wouldn't really do that that much
but<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.159> windows<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> rather<00:01:21.330> long

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but the windows are kind of rather long

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.770 
but the windows are kind of rather long
they're<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.009> small<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> 57

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they're not really like small like a 57

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.010 
they're not really like small like a 57
but<00:01:25.200> yeah<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.840> weird

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
but yeah so here it is and the weird

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
but yeah so here it is and the weird
thing<00:01:28.229> about<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.680> plane<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
thing about this plane is that on this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
thing about this plane is that on this
plane<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> huge<00:01:31.530> gap

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
plane there is like this huge gap

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
plane there is like this huge gap
between<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:33.090> windows<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.869> sure<00:01:34.049> if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
between little windows I'm not sure if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.580 
between little windows I'm not sure if
you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.290> here

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you can see it but it's like right here

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
you can see it but it's like right here
so<00:01:38.159> I'm<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.549> sure<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.360> tell<00:01:39.420> me<00:01:39.659> why

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so I'm not sure if you can tell me why

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.310 
so I'm not sure if you can tell me why
the<00:01:39.869> other<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the other thing but here it is and I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.370 
the other thing but here it is and I
really<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.390> I'm

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really like it and like this I'm

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.810 
really like it and like this I'm
thinking<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.770> getting<00:01:46.979> another<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.579> it's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
thinking about getting another one it's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
thinking about getting another one it's
probably<00:01:48.030> these<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.360> gonna<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.549> American

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
probably these are gonna be the American

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
probably these are gonna be the American
or<00:01:50.729> DHL<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.540> might<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.259> others<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.979> here

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
or DHL I might get one others but here

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370 
or DHL I might get one others but here
it<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.750> model<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it is and it's a really nice model and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.010 
it is and it's a really nice model and
check<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.490> us<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:56.990> okay<00:01:57.990> so
