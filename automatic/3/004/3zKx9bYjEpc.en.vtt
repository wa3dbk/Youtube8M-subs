00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
use the Mac keyboard but even if I do

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060

use<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> Mac<00:00:39.180> keyboard<00:00:39.719> sometimes<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.770> jig

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
use the Mac keyboard sometimes the jig

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.560 
use the Mac keyboard sometimes the jig
but<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.610> doesn't<00:00:42.000> eject<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:44.420> get<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
but it doesn't eject you have to get the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
but it doesn't eject you have to get the
keyboard<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.260> designed<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> Mac

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
keyboard that was designed for the Mac

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
keyboard that was designed for the Mac
so<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> headache<00:00:48.239> I've<00:00:48.930> researched<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so it's a headache I've researched the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
so it's a headache I've researched the
board<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.570> found<00:00:51.899> anywhere<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
board I have not found anywhere on the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
board I have not found anywhere on the
internet<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.670> board<00:00:53.940> any<00:00:54.239> shortcuts

internet or on the board any shortcuts
to<00:00:57.079> terminals<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.910> short<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to terminals that I can just short and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
to terminals that I can just short and
it<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.719> eject<00:01:01.109> discs<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.100> did<00:01:02.850> find<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it would eject discs for me I did find a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
it would eject discs for me I did find a
couple<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.870> buttons<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> these

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
couple of buttons on here and these

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
couple of buttons on here and these
buttons<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:07.110> turning<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> computer<00:01:08.340> off

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
buttons are for turning the computer off

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.969 
buttons are for turning the computer off
or<00:01:09.119> resetting<00:01:09.600> looks<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> them<00:01:10.830> are

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
or resetting looks like two of them are

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
or resetting looks like two of them are
missing<00:01:11.100> they're<00:01:11.909> three<00:01:12.299> buttons<00:01:12.720> designed

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
missing they're three buttons designed

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.090 
missing they're three buttons designed
to<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.810> missing<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.439> turning<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to are missing one is turning the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
to are missing one is turning the
computer<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:20.570> tried<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> short<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
computer off and on I tried to short the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
computer off and on I tried to short the
other<00:01:22.650> terminals<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.360> eject

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
other terminals they do not do eject

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.460 
other terminals they do not do eject
obviously<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.700> do<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> close<00:01:27.210> examination<00:01:27.540> as

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
obviously I do the close examination as

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
obviously I do the close examination as
close<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.130> could<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.520> didn't<00:01:29.820> find

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
close as they could they didn't find

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
close as they could they didn't find
anything<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.229> would<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.650> eject<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> disk

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
anything that would say eject the disk

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.620 
anything that would say eject the disk
so<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.650> research<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> disk<00:01:36.240> drive

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so I put my research into the disk drive

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.580 
so I put my research into the disk drive
itself<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.530> here's<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.400> found<00:01:39.590> if

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
itself and here's what I have found if

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
itself and here's what I have found if
we<00:01:43.310> use<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> screwdriver<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.360> release<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
we use a screwdriver and release a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
we use a screwdriver and release a
couple<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.130> catches<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> pull<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
couple of catches here and pull the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.069 
couple of catches here and pull the
front<00:01:51.540> panel<00:01:51.899> out<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
front panel out there is actually a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.139 
front panel out there is actually a
circuitry<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.490> place<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:58.170> eject<00:01:58.649> button

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
circuitry in place for an eject button

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.950 
circuitry in place for an eject button
Mac<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.659> try<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
Mac does not use it but I did try and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 
Mac does not use it but I did try and
use<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.799> tweezers<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.369> short-circuit<00:02:06.590> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
use the tweezers to short-circuit this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.729 
use the tweezers to short-circuit this
terminals<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.660> drive<00:02:09.660> did<00:02:09.959> eject<00:02:10.410> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
terminals and the drive did eject so

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.540 
terminals and the drive did eject so
what<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:10.979> planning<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.400> do

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
what I'm planning to do

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.130 
what I'm planning to do
I'm<00:02:12.610> gonna<00:02:12.790> put<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> button<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.630> there<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
I'm gonna put the button in there and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.700 
I'm gonna put the button in there and
I'm<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.340> place<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.240> back<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.870> drill<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
I'm going to place it back and drill a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.570 
I'm going to place it back and drill a
hole<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.240> case<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:21.420> make<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:24.520> thing

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
hole in the case and make this thing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.540 
hole in the case and make this thing
ejectable<00:02:25.440> another<00:02:26.440> thing<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.920> could<00:02:27.130> do<00:02:27.310> is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
ejectable another thing I could do is

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.210 
ejectable another thing I could do is
just<00:02:27.940> relocate<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.810> button<00:02:29.230> somewhere<00:02:30.070> else

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
just relocate the button somewhere else

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.220 
just relocate the button somewhere else
but<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> think<00:02:31.450> my<00:02:32.320> idea<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.490> hole<00:02:34.230> will

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
but I think my idea with the hole will

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.550 
but I think my idea with the hole will
be<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:36.160> fine

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
be just fine

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.280 
be just fine
relocating<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.650> button<00:02:38.980> I'd<00:02:39.130> have<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.670> run

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
relocating a button I'd have to run

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.110 
relocating a button I'd have to run
wires<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.860> here<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.460> another<00:02:42.580> place<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
wires from here to another place and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.690 
wires from here to another place and
just<00:02:44.490> not<00:02:46.170> optimistic<00:02:47.170> about<00:02:47.530> doing<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.280> but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
just not optimistic about doing that but

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.200 
just not optimistic about doing that but
it's<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.660> doable<00:02:49.930> thing<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:51.280> maybe<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.090> little

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
it's a doable thing it's maybe a little

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.490 
it's a doable thing it's maybe a little
easier<00:02:52.840> than<00:02:53.260> hole<00:02:53.650> because<00:02:54.360> there's<00:02:55.500> metal

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
easier than hole because there's metal

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
easier than hole because there's metal
reinforcement<00:02:58.770> in<00:02:59.770> case<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.430> might<00:03:00.670> make<00:03:01.660> my

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
reinforcement in case that might make my

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.060 
reinforcement in case that might make my
life<00:03:02.170> difficult<00:03:03.130> by<00:03:03.780> drilling<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.990> hole<00:03:05.070> so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
life difficult by drilling a hole so

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.550 
life difficult by drilling a hole so
then<00:03:06.280> you're<00:03:06.430> right<00:03:06.580> there<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:08.050> little<00:03:08.440> bit

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
then you're right there is a little bit

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.310 
then you're right there is a little bit
of<00:03:08.680> an<00:03:08.830> override<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:10.150> requires<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.200> more

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
of an override it requires a little more

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.620 
of an override it requires a little more
work<00:03:11.500> than<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.160> hoping<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.610> but<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.420> can

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
work than I was hoping for but we can

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.610 
work than I was hoping for but we can
put<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> button<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.980> drive<00:03:15.670> itself<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
put a button on the drive itself and

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.270 
put a button on the drive itself and
make<00:03:17.700> energetic<00:03:18.700> button<00:03:19.030> on<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> Mac<00:03:19.390> so

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
make energetic button on a Mac so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.320 
make energetic button on a Mac so
hopefully<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:21.370> somebody<00:03:21.670> was<00:03:21.790> looking<00:03:21.850> for<00:03:22.300> a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
hopefully if somebody was looking for a

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.940 
hopefully if somebody was looking for a
project<00:03:22.570> like<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.170> now<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:25.800> what<00:03:26.800> to
