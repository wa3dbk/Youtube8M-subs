00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
video is my gap filler which is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.530 
video is my gap filler which is
honeycomb<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:52.699> ran<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.299> bits

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
honeycomb or ran the other bits

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.450 
honeycomb or ran the other bits
basically<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.589> fill<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:55.920> gaps<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
basically just to fill in the gaps I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
basically just to fill in the gaps I
don't<00:00:56.729> like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.089> look<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> gaps<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.989> let

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
don't like the look of gaps really let

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.289 
don't like the look of gaps really let
the<00:00:58.650> elbow<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.220> I'm<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.729> bit<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.089> Minj

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
the elbow because I'm a bit of a Minj

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.990 
the elbow because I'm a bit of a Minj
and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.080> think<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.860> just<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.220> breaks<00:01:02.549> it<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and I think it just like breaks it up a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
and I think it just like breaks it up a
bit<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> looks<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bit and so that's what it looks like so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
bit and so that's what it looks like so
yeah<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> forearm<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> completed<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.770> I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
with my arm I like the fact that from a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.300 
with my arm I like the fact that from a
distance<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.800> doesn't<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.100> look<00:02:13.250> like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
distance it doesn't really look like

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.520 
distance it doesn't really look like
much<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.240> cannot<00:02:14.480> close<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.350> can

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
much but when you cannot close you can

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.880 
much but when you cannot close you can
actually<00:02:15.650> see<00:02:16.040> what's<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:18.260> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
actually see what's in it so I like and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.590 
actually see what's in it so I like and
then<00:02:19.010> my<00:02:19.100> newest<00:02:19.460> one<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.000> another<00:02:20.300> best

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600

her head long anyway but we both got our
neck<00:02:28.940> tattoos<00:02:29.390> when<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:30.020> have<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.500> short
