00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.900
 cold 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.519
 if it is stained archaic mention 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.449
 rescue 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.690
 the announcement of the most important how for a moment 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.739
 on mac os x 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.829
 one year before 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.130
 as you certainly know everything 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.359
 operating costs are on the menu 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.250
 officially 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.090
 in the final it's finally not December what it is true that I think we can 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.260
 do now 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.729
 It is clear that there is still no 86 trial start date. 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.729
 really in a refunded amount 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.470
 destroyed executioner incomprehensible 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 it's exceptional that in my opinion will never change 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 but it's true that in my opinion Cedric's return is completed by site one 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.260
 little more people down below coach because everyone of 7 black 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 ops i think it m 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 that was the only way to counter a recover some of his 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.440
 communities and to put one of his advisors 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.520
 in the company a small private party with friends I have my class that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.380
 I use every time 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.780
 I'm so little black ops that once the pen in the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.480
 population a series of problems in touch 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.460
 this he s 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
 and then in fact he wanted to set himself up second complement of a first goal 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.780
 of you are 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.890
 on my goal 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 which was the sector rather nothing that I reproduce has not long 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.690
 kg this video two or three days after early exit 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.410
 of the year not too bad market people were fine but a little a 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.040
 explanation that I had done the same it's a very very vague moment 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.180
 no we are on pole who no one below the texts 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.720
 so clear enough brake command really technical it's 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.520
 the training required to counter advanced training 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.900
 advice from private parties like that with as many people as possible 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 more the same as at the highest quality 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.090
 and the more we are doing 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.820
 to avoid him at his side 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.330
 because country up 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.560
 we know that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 the crops are still there he will leave is practically do 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 to which especially the columns of the times 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.509
 i just hope novel that advocates w3a 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.739
 close your eyes 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.669
 the vine is like that but then we are reduced to the month of november 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.689
 warfare 3 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.859
 story really they're going to do something because 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.059
 that's why everything fell markers their quest 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.639
 a bar you need a ball of bars in real life is for 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.409
 expose in times of crisis to make about 50 centimeters so 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.849
 I will take a ball of 50 centimeters even in their 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.029
 legs territories are snapping up 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.499
 it makes sense to me 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.569
 what are you talking about any other ah yes you are seen so I had announced that 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.429
 I closed editors and other garbage all the problems I had with the 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.209
 cube 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.459
 so the flesh is firm but I have almost complete all 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.069
 videos and me just 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.379
 a few tutorials we dream of cinema worried besides pleaded m I 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.289
 think I can their master anyway 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.249
 what people liked to give explanations I think I'm going in 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:07.899
 to put 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.899
 and a montage masters yesterday and that I normally put back 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.439
 in the week because I had a small problem it's still the 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.099
 chain that I had made from his computer 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.399
 I am trying to see how to recover the video 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.669
 in fact I had proposed on a yoplait shareholder on a chain 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.669
 ii who in the program 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.689
 away from the little door 6% 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.109
 then end of season in the end no longer leave the centralist 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.839
 Sports press 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.989
 I just want it to come partly from poker the deputy of vendÃ©e 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.069
 no matter what I wanted to just explain what it gives 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.069
 what advanced training effort after even with the psg it's going pretty well 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.529
 for me it is clear that it is not that which is well 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:48.590
 the targeted raid 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.590
 hours a month to give back the envy of playing + to 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.260
 finally black ops is right now with the beta to say what is unjust 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.849
 which lasts until 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.829
 Mayor Watkins May 16 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.979
 I'm going to focus 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.449
 three players are rather Kurds against 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.839
 we see badly at the end of this video 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.530
 adding you liked this article 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.779
 the institute a little click 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:14.099
 and to see common document I do not forget the double mobile game can let 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.639
 comments we find ourselves very soon for a video it was their 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.599
