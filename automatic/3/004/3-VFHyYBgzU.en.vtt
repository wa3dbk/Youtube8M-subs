first<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:42.000> take<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> airbox<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.680> once<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
first up take the airbox out once you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.979 
first up take the airbox out once you
take<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.149> there's<00:00:45.480> plenty<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> room<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
take this out there's plenty of room to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.490 
take this out there's plenty of room to
work<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.850> inside<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.450> underneath<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
work and get inside and underneath for

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.740 
work and get inside and underneath for
everything<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> airbox

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
everything over here it's the airbox

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
everything over here it's the airbox
should<00:00:52.170> definitely<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.949> remove<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
should definitely come first remove the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
should definitely come first remove the
cooling<00:00:54.629> fan<00:00:54.870> connector<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.590> also<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
cooling fan connector okay it's also a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
cooling fan connector okay it's also a
good<00:01:01.949> idea<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.730> label<00:01:03.270> where<00:01:03.570> everything<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
good idea to label where everything is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
good idea to label where everything is
because<00:01:04.290> once<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> disconnect<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because once you disconnect all this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
because once you disconnect all this
stuff<00:01:05.689> not<00:01:06.689> gonna<00:01:06.840> member<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.530> it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
it pulls right through on the fuel rail

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.530 
it pulls right through on the fuel rail
since<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.790> pressurized<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.250> cap

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
since it's pressurized they have a cap

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.140 
since it's pressurized they have a cap
right<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.520> don't<00:02:41.520> know<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.940> see
