if<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.470> about<00:02:31.590> fisk<00:02:32.010> automotive<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
if you think about fisk automotive that

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.420 
if you think about fisk automotive that
is<00:02:33.420> our<00:02:33.629> brand<00:02:34.019> defining<00:02:34.650> car<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.250> is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
is our brand defining car and that is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.360 
is our brand defining car and that is
why<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:36.540> made<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.019> car<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:37.560> radical<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
why we made this car so radical in this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.670 
why we made this car so radical in this
proportion<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.150> there's<00:02:39.329> looks<00:02:39.680> because

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
proportion and there's looks because

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440 
proportion and there's looks because
this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.489> we<00:02:41.639> are<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:41.790> we're<00:02:42.180> about

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
this is what we are about we're about

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
this is what we are about we're about
ultimate<00:02:43.079> beauty<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.859> we<00:02:44.040> needed<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.400> create

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
ultimate beauty and we needed to create

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030 
ultimate beauty and we needed to create
and<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.060> wanted<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> create<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.900> car<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.920> was

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and we wanted to create a car that was

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.009 
and we wanted to create a car that was
way<00:02:47.370> more<00:02:47.639> dramatic<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.359> way<00:02:48.540> more<00:02:48.810> beautiful

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
way more dramatic and way more beautiful

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.520 
way more dramatic and way more beautiful
and<00:02:49.650> made<00:02:49.859> way<00:02:50.280> beyond<00:02:50.670> average<00:02:51.019> in<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.230> class

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and made way beyond average in the class

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620 
and made way beyond average in the class
that<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.920> go<00:02:53.069> into<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.150> car<00:02:54.389> looks

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that we go into if the car looks

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.259 
that we go into if the car looks
familiar<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> it's<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
familiar to you it's because the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.210 
familiar to you it's because the
designer<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.989> owner<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.100> man

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
designer and the owner and the man

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.460 
designer and the owner and the man
behind<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.760> car<00:03:00.060> used<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> designer

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
behind this car used to be a designer

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.500 
behind this car used to be a designer
for<00:03:01.709> BMW<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.519> there<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.880> certainly<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.299> lot<00:03:03.480> of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
for BMW so there is certainly a lot of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.809 
for BMW so there is certainly a lot of
BMW<00:03:04.079> influence<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> car<00:03:04.889> he<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.489> also

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
BMW influence in the car he is also

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.270 
BMW influence in the car he is also
responsible<00:03:06.150> for<00:03:06.690> designing<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.920> Austin

responsible for designing the Austin

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 
responsible for designing the Austin
Martin<00:03:08.400> Vantage<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.660> db9<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.859> way

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
Martin Vantage and the db9 so in a way

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.970 
Martin Vantage and the db9 so in a way
this<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.940> kind<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.450> hybrid<00:03:12.660> between<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.560> db9

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
this is kind of a hybrid between a db9

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.259 
this is kind of a hybrid between a db9
and<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:15.120> BMW<00:03:15.389> we<00:03:16.200> asked<00:03:16.380> goodyear<00:03:16.919> to<00:03:17.400> create

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
and a BMW we asked goodyear to create

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.039 
and a BMW we asked goodyear to create
special<00:03:18.599> high<00:03:19.049> profile<00:03:19.620> tires<00:03:20.450> which<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
special high profile tires which the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.360 
special high profile tires which the
only<00:03:22.169> other<00:03:22.440> car<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.919> would<00:03:23.040> see<00:03:23.190> that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
only other car do kind of would see that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.860 
only other car do kind of would see that
on<00:03:23.519> would<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> rolls-royce<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.690> also

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
on would be a rolls-royce which also

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.020 
on would be a rolls-royce which also
have<00:03:25.079> very<00:03:25.290> large<00:03:25.500> wheels<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.220> high<00:03:26.579> profile

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
have very large wheels but high profile

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.270 
have very large wheels but high profile
tires<00:03:27.329> what's<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.349> surprising<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:29.130> when

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
tires what's really surprising is when

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.849 
tires what's really surprising is when
you<00:03:29.370> put<00:03:29.609> 22<00:03:30.329> inch<00:03:30.569> wheels<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> car<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.590> mean

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
you put 22 inch wheels on a car I mean

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.159 
you put 22 inch wheels on a car I mean
these<00:03:32.069> are<00:03:32.280> steam<00:03:32.639> haulers<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> think

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
these are steam haulers then you think

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.470 
these are steam haulers then you think
that<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> ride<00:03:34.590> would<00:03:34.919> be<00:03:34.950> very<00:03:35.609> harsh<00:03:35.910> but

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that the ride would be very harsh but

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.699 
that the ride would be very harsh but
because<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.900> car<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.139> such<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.410> long

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
because this car is such a long

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.710 
because this car is such a long
wheelbase<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.609> it's<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.970> heavy<00:03:39.150> it's

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
wheelbase and because it's so heavy it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.200 
wheelbase and because it's so heavy it's
actually<00:03:40.349> quite<00:03:40.590> good

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
actually quite good

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.370 
actually quite good
if<00:03:43.210> you<00:03:43.300> hear<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.690> well<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.350> a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
if you hear that well that is a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.440 
if you hear that well that is a
signature<00:03:44.950> sound<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.610> Fisker<00:03:45.970> Karma
