all<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.970> don't<00:02:53.269> know<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.750> spawns<00:02:54.049> are<00:02:54.230> fairly

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
all I don't know the spawns are fairly

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.259 
all I don't know the spawns are fairly
predictable<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.430> judge<00:02:55.849> where<00:02:56.060> people

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269

predictable you can judge where people
going<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> spawn<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.900> stuff<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.230> which

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
going to spawn and stuff like that which

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.949 
going to spawn and stuff like that which
is<00:02:58.160> really<00:02:58.459> good<00:02:58.640> because<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.090> really<00:02:59.450> really

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
is really good because I really really

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.470 
is really good because I really really

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
modern warfare 3 I think it's a bit

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.330 
modern warfare 3 I think it's a bit
worse<00:03:11.090> actually<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:11.930> honest<00:03:12.319> I'm<00:03:12.980> the

worse actually to be honest I'm the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.670 
worse actually to be honest I'm the

front of your face and I said like a
good<00:03:18.440> player<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:19.430> master<00:03:19.790> these<00:03:19.910> born

good player can master these born
systems<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.900> they<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.410> really<00:03:21.650> use<00:03:21.829> them<00:03:22.010> to

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
systems and they can really use them to

their<00:03:22.250> benefits<00:03:22.669> because<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.030> know<00:03:23.180> where

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
their benefits because you know where

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.909 
their benefits because you know where
people<00:03:23.480> are<00:03:23.599> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.840> be<00:03:23.959> basically<00:03:24.200> if<00:03:24.799> you

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
people are going to be basically if you

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.220 
people are going to be basically if you
kill<00:03:25.220> someone<00:03:25.519> standing<00:03:26.389> here<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.840> you're

standing<00:03:27.590> there<00:03:27.620> then<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.310> know<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.669> next

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
standing there then you know the next

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.339 
standing there then you know the next
person<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.299> probably<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> spawn<00:03:30.109> in<00:03:30.290> a

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
and work out where people might spawn I

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.189 
and work out where people might spawn I
know<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.030> there's<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.419> couple<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.900> spawns

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.020 
know that there's a couple of spawns
around<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.560> area<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.159> I'm<00:04:19.430> always<00:04:19.700> checking

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
around this area so I'm always checking

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.270 
around this area so I'm always checking
my<00:04:20.329> back<00:04:20.510> that's<00:04:21.229> something<00:04:21.409> also<00:04:21.620> on<00:04:22.039> free

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
my back that's something also on free

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.830 
my back that's something also on free
for<00:04:22.490> all<00:04:22.550> you're<00:04:22.820> not<00:04:22.909> necessary<00:04:23.330> black<00:04:23.599> ops

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
for all you're not necessary black ops

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.190 
for all you're not necessary black ops
is

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
is

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.470 
is
but<00:04:24.500> definitely<00:04:24.680> modern<00:04:25.130> warfare<00:04:25.480> always

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
but definitely modern warfare always

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.030 
but definitely modern warfare always
check<00:04:26.750> your<00:04:26.780> back<00:04:27.080> especially<00:04:27.590> when<00:04:27.950> you're

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
check your back especially when you're

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.120 
check your back especially when you're
walking<00:04:28.220> down<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.610> long<00:04:28.940> corridor<00:04:29.630> or<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.530> long

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
walking down a long corridor or a long

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.910 
walking down a long corridor or a long
pathway<00:04:32.200> interchanges<00:04:33.200> probably<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
pathway interchanges probably like the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.590 
pathway interchanges probably like the
most<00:04:34.070> open<00:04:34.460> map<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:34.910> got<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.060> lot<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.270> long

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
most open map and it's got a lot of long

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840 
most open map and it's got a lot of long
routes<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.250> really<00:04:37.550> need<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.760> be

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
routes and so you really need to be

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.280 
routes and so you really need to be
checking<00:04:38.150> back<00:04:38.180> because<00:04:38.630> people<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.050> spawn

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
checking back because people do spawn

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.560 
checking back because people do spawn
behind<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.940> they<00:04:40.940> can<00:04:41.180> pick<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:41.540> up

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
behind you and they can pick you up

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.510 
behind you and they can pick you up
quite<00:04:41.870> easily<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.290> whenever<00:04:43.010> I'm<00:04:43.190> running

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
quite easily so whenever I'm running

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.130 
quite easily so whenever I'm running
you'll<00:04:43.640> see<00:04:43.820> me<00:04:43.970> I'll<00:04:44.150> turn<00:04:44.450> around<00:04:44.480> or<00:04:44.870> check

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
you'll see me I'll turn around or check

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.980 
you'll see me I'll turn around or check
what's<00:04:45.350> behind<00:04:45.500> me<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:46.240> dead<00:04:47.240> silence<00:04:47.480> is<00:04:47.960> a

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
what's behind me a dead silence is a

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.960 
what's behind me a dead silence is a
very<00:04:48.260> good<00:04:48.320> perk<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.920> have<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.130> um<00:04:49.430> head<00:04:49.820> two
