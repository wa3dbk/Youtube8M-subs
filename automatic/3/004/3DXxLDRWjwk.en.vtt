00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
back at some other deck types that I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.319 
back at some other deck types that I
felt<00:00:55.980> wasn't<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.730> competitive<00:00:57.240> at

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
felt wasn't really that competitive at

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
felt wasn't really that competitive at
the<00:00:57.360> time<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.610> this<00:00:59.610> actually<00:00:59.940> does<00:01:00.329> pretty

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the time and this actually does pretty

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.490 
the time and this actually does pretty

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
good its red-eyes bill and made if you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
good its red-eyes bill and made if you
look<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.130> actually<00:01:05.369> incorporate<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
look at it I actually incorporate on the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.889

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
grepher in here but doesn't really work

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.320 
grepher in here but doesn't really work
that<00:01:33.060> well<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.420> anyway<00:01:34.700> what<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you play dragon shrine you dump red eyes

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
you play dragon shrine you dump red eyes
and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> dump<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> wyvern<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:40.260> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and then you dump a wyvern and at the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
and then you dump a wyvern and at the
end<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> turn<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.460> special<00:01:41.700> someone

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
out of red eyes and you think was only

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.910 
out of red eyes and you think was only
got<00:01:43.710> 24<00:01:44.040> attack<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> level<00:01:45.420> 7<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.830> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
got 24 attack will use a level 7 some of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
got 24 attack will use a level 7 some of
the<00:01:46.979> strongest<00:01:47.760> succeeds<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> game<00:01:48.780> our

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the strongest succeeds in the game our

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.760 
the strongest succeeds in the game our
ranks<00:01:49.740> Evans<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.690> you're<00:01:51.690> able<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> bring<00:01:52.650> out

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
ranks Evans so you're able to bring out

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.020 
ranks Evans so you're able to bring out
that<00:01:52.920> red<00:01:53.130> eyes<00:01:53.420> using<00:01:54.650> car<00:01:55.650> bet<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:56.030> basically

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
putting something in like glow-up bulb I

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.710 
putting something in like glow-up bulb I
just<00:03:51.740> feel<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:51.890> what<00:03:52.130> slowed<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.520> down<00:03:52.720> but

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
just feel like what slowed it down but

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.210 
just feel like what slowed it down but
anyway<00:03:54.200> I've<00:03:54.320> played<00:03:54.530> with<00:03:54.650> variance<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.130> this

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
anyway I've played with variance of this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.680 
anyway I've played with variance of this
where<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.580> have<00:03:55.610> arm<00:03:55.820> again<00:03:56.060> tonight<00:03:56.360> but

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
where you have arm again tonight but

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.860 
where you have arm again tonight but
that<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:56.870> seems<00:03:57.230> too<00:03:57.680> slow<00:03:57.950> for<00:03:57.980> me

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
that just seems too slow for me

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.230 
that just seems too slow for me
mathematician<00:03:59.870> floats<00:04:00.260> he's<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.220> plus<00:04:01.550> one<00:04:01.850> so

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
mathematician floats he's a plus one so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.070 
mathematician floats he's a plus one so
he's<00:04:02.660> pretty<00:04:03.140> cool<00:04:04.420> not<00:04:05.420> only<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.600> I'm<00:04:05.930> I

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
he's pretty cool not only that I'm I

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.020 
he's pretty cool not only that I'm I
also<00:04:06.230> thought<00:04:06.710> of<00:04:06.770> putting<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.520> reasoning

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
also thought of putting and reasoning

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.850 
also thought of putting and reasoning
into<00:04:08.240> this<00:04:08.360> deck<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.900> think<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.560> have<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.770> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
into this deck I think I have in the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.340 
into this deck I think I have in the
past<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.550> guess<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.540> could<00:04:11.570> swap<00:04:11.960> out<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.260> up

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
past I guess you could swap out the up

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.990 
past I guess you could swap out the up
stars<00:04:12.620> for<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.040> but<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.220> have<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.520> tested<00:04:13.880> that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
stars for it but I have not tested that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.650 
stars for it but I have not tested that
yet<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:16.040> have<00:04:16.130> lots<00:04:16.460> of<00:04:16.820> options<00:04:17.030> of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
yet but you have lots of options of

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.600 
yet but you have lots of options of
things<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:18.140> go<00:04:18.290> into<00:04:18.470> you've<00:04:19.010> got<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.460> whole

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
things to go into you've got a whole

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.860 
things to go into you've got a whole
bunch<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:19.880> rank<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.239> can<00:04:20.390> go<00:04:20.480> in<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.660> rank<00:04:20.810> for

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
bunch of rank you can go in to rank for

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.060 
bunch of rank you can go in to rank for
you<00:04:21.260> go<00:04:21.470> into<00:04:21.650> rank<00:04:21.830> three<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.580> could<00:04:22.790> go<00:04:22.940> into

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
you go into rank three you could go into

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.430 
you go into rank three you could go into
seven<00:04:26.410> you've<00:04:27.410> got<00:04:27.590> lots<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.980> choices<00:04:28.160> and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
seven you've got lots of choices and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.390 
seven you've got lots of choices and
this<00:04:30.440> deck<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:31.010> think<00:04:31.340> say<00:04:32.000> if<00:04:32.440> knee<00:04:33.440> cross<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.840> a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
this deck I think say if knee cross is a

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.620 
this deck I think say if knee cross is a
tier<00:04:37.400> 1<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.290> probably<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.920> tier<00:04:40.460> two<00:04:41.150> point

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
tier 1 this is probably a tier two point

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.860 
tier 1 this is probably a tier two point
two<00:04:41.720> deck<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.370> it's<00:04:43.550> really<00:04:43.910> fun<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.300> play<00:04:44.570> i'd
