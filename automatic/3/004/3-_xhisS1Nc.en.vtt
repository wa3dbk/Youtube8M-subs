00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
company I tried to do through yash which

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.180 
company I tried to do through yash which
is<00:02:08.280> apparently<00:02:08.519> a<00:02:08.729> gaming<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.190> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
is apparently a gaming thing and that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.069 
is apparently a gaming thing and that
didn't<00:02:11.459> work<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.420> thought<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.900> you

didn't work so I just thought that you
cancel<00:02:13.709> my<00:02:13.860> account<00:02:13.920> there

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
cancel my account there

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.289 
cancel my account there
do<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.250> found<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.549> new<00:02:15.700> place<00:02:15.879> called
