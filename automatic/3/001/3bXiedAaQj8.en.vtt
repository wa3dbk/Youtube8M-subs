just<00:02:47.930> cutting<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.260> tool<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> way<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.709> cut

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
just cutting the tool the way I cut

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.349 
just cutting the tool the way I cut
Toland<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.930> my<00:02:51.049> tutorials<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:56.030> here<00:02:56.299> are

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
Toland all of my tutorials and here are

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.699 
Toland all of my tutorials and here are
the<00:02:56.419> supplies<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> actually<00:02:57.169> cut<00:02:57.500> way<00:02:57.650> too

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
the supplies and I actually cut way too

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.879 
the supplies and I actually cut way too
much<00:02:58.010> fabric<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.639> had<00:02:58.819> quite<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.329> bit<00:02:59.540> left<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.829> it

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
much fabric I had quite a bit left so it

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.289 
much fabric I had quite a bit left so it
doesn't<00:03:01.189> take<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.340> lot<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.639> fabric<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:02.120> make<00:03:02.269> a

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
doesn't take a lot of fabric to make a

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.250 
doesn't take a lot of fabric to make a
skirt<00:03:02.569> like<00:03:02.629> this<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:05.150> first<00:03:05.419> starting<00:03:05.840> at<00:03:06.049> my

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
skirt like this so first starting at my

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.500 
skirt like this so first starting at my
seam<00:03:06.590> where<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.129> glued<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> elastic<00:03:08.359> together

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
seam where I glued the elastic together

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.449 
seam where I glued the elastic together
I'm<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.079> work<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.439> covering<00:03:09.889> that<00:03:10.099> first

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
I'm going to work on covering that first

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.949 
I'm going to work on covering that first
I<00:03:12.159> just<00:03:13.159> apply<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.760> fabric<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.329> same<00:03:14.510> way

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I just apply the fabric the same way

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.800 
I just apply the fabric the same way
apply<00:03:15.379> tool<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:16.010> all<00:03:16.579> of<00:03:16.879> my<00:03:17.000> tutorials<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:17.750> if

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
apply tool in all of my tutorials so if

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.240 
apply tool in all of my tutorials so if
you<00:03:17.900> haven't<00:03:18.079> seen<00:03:18.349> my<00:03:18.409> other<00:03:18.709> tutorials

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
you haven't seen my other tutorials

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.309 
you haven't seen my other tutorials
check<00:03:19.310> those<00:03:19.699> out

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.290 

but<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.349> use<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.739> same<00:03:24.769> technique<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:26.180> you

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
but I use the same technique and you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.729 
but I use the same technique and you
just<00:03:26.450> have<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.690> play<00:03:26.840> with<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.110> fabric<00:03:27.290> for<00:03:27.680> a

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
just have to play with the fabric for a

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.320 
just have to play with the fabric for a
little<00:03:27.920> while<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.220> get<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.580> cover<00:03:28.790> that

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
little while to get it to cover that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.680 
little while to get it to cover that
scene

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.150 

this<00:03:38.690> part<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.019> super<00:03:39.230> easy<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.680> do<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.040> could

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
this part is super easy to do you could

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.589 
this part is super easy to do you could
even<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.430> your<00:03:40.670> little<00:03:40.819> girl<00:03:41.060> help<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.450> with

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
even have your little girl help you with

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.650 
even have your little girl help you with
this

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
this

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.720 
this
and<00:03:44.660> I'm<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.050> mixing<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.800> tool<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
and I'm just mixing the tool and the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:56.010 
and I'm just mixing the tool and the
different<00:03:47.030> color<00:03:47.209> fabric<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.920> randomly

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.900 

now<00:03:57.020> if<00:03:57.290> you're<00:03:57.620> adding<00:03:57.980> tool<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.550> skirt

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
now if you're adding tool to the skirt

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.820 
now if you're adding tool to the skirt
you<00:03:59.180> will<00:03:59.750> not<00:03:59.900> put<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.500> washing

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
you will not put this on the washing

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.750 
you will not put this on the washing
machine<00:04:01.270> because<00:04:02.270> well<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.530> could<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:04.100> don't

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
machine because well you could I don't

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.580 
machine because well you could I don't
know<00:04:04.910> don't<00:04:05.630> don't<00:04:06.020> put<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.410> washing

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
know don't don't put in the washing

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.240 
know don't don't put in the washing
machine

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
machine

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.070 
machine
don't<00:04:07.850> put<00:04:08.060> tool<00:04:08.300> in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> washing<00:04:08.690> machine

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
don't put tool in the washing machine

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.450 
don't put tool in the washing machine
and<00:04:09.260> definitely<00:04:09.680> don't<00:04:09.800> put<00:04:10.010> it<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.250> dryer

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
and definitely don't put it in the dryer

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.580 
and definitely don't put it in the dryer
so<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.180> would<00:04:11.630> definitely<00:04:11.750> recommend<00:04:12.020> hand

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
so I would definitely recommend hand

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.800 
so I would definitely recommend hand
washing<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:13.100> skirt<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.580> air<00:04:14.300> drying<00:04:14.570> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
washing the skirt and air drying the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:32.520 
washing the skirt and air drying the
skirt

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.350 

so<00:04:33.530> I'm<00:04:33.680> just<00:04:33.889> alternating<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.669> tool<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.270> the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
so I'm just alternating the tool and the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:54.100 
so I'm just alternating the tool and the
fabric<00:04:35.810> until<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.830> entire<00:04:37.220> band<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.480> complete

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.140 

so<00:04:54.680> now<00:04:54.830> that's<00:04:55.099> complete<00:04:55.490> I'm<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.789> fluffing

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
so now that's complete I'm just fluffing

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.240 
so now that's complete I'm just fluffing
it<00:04:56.210> out<00:04:56.360> making<00:04:56.689> sure<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:57.319> didn't<00:04:57.949> miss<00:04:58.039> any

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
it out making sure I didn't miss any

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.269 
it out making sure I didn't miss any
spaces

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.889 

so<00:05:03.909> now<00:05:03.999> I'm<00:05:04.089> going<00:05:04.209> to<00:05:04.269> add<00:05:04.449> glitter<00:05:04.719> tulle<00:05:04.989> I

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899 
so now I'm going to add glitter tulle I

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.719 
so now I'm going to add glitter tulle I
don't<00:05:07.899> like<00:05:08.049> to<00:05:08.229> add<00:05:08.349> glitter<00:05:08.889> tulle<00:05:09.219> and<00:05:09.519> big

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
don't like to add glitter tulle and big

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.219 
don't like to add glitter tulle and big
chunks<00:05:10.089> because<00:05:10.479> if<00:05:10.749> you've<00:05:10.899> ever<00:05:11.049> worked

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
chunks because if you've ever worked

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.899 
chunks because if you've ever worked
with<00:05:11.379> a<00:05:11.439> glitter<00:05:11.679> tulle<00:05:11.979> you'll<00:05:12.609> know<00:05:12.729> it's

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
with a glitter tulle you'll know it's

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.229 
with a glitter tulle you'll know it's
kind<00:05:13.089> of<00:05:13.209> stiff<00:05:13.989> and<00:05:14.549> doesn't<00:05:15.549> Bend<00:05:15.819> very<00:05:15.909> well

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:16.239 
kind of stiff and doesn't Bend very well

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.299 
kind of stiff and doesn't Bend very well
and<00:05:16.539> when<00:05:16.929> you<00:05:17.019> try<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.229> make<00:05:17.829> it<00:05:17.949> Bend<00:05:18.159> like

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:18.309 
and when you try to make it Bend like

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:19.499 
and when you try to make it Bend like
other<00:05:18.519> tool<00:05:18.789> you<00:05:19.029> just<00:05:19.059> end<00:05:19.329> up<00:05:19.389> getting

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
other tool you just end up getting

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.539 
other tool you just end up getting
glitter<00:05:19.839> all<00:05:20.049> over<00:05:20.079> everything<00:05:20.559> so<00:05:21.339> what<00:05:21.489> I

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:21.549 
glitter all over everything so what I

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:24.119 
glitter all over everything so what I
like<00:05:21.759> to<00:05:21.819> do<00:05:22.089> is<00:05:22.359> cut<00:05:22.599> it<00:05:22.689> into<00:05:22.899> strips<00:05:23.469> and<00:05:23.829> use

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
like to do is cut it into strips and use

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:31.949 
like to do is cut it into strips and use
smaller<00:05:24.459> strips<00:05:30.149> so<00:05:31.149> here<00:05:31.419> you'll<00:05:31.569> see<00:05:31.749> I'm

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:31.959 
smaller strips so here you'll see I'm

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.159 
smaller strips so here you'll see I'm
cutting<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.379> into<00:05:32.619> three<00:05:32.949> small<00:05:33.789> strips<00:05:34.209> and

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169
