now my daughter's was one situation at a
host<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.710> their<00:01:25.830> senses<00:01:26.280> take<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:26.850> they

host all of their senses take over they

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890 
host all of their senses take over they
cannot<00:01:27.930> handle<00:01:28.620> it<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.270> either<00:01:30.479> shut

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

down

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.700 
down
then<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.670> assumption<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:34.810> child<00:01:35.560> may

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710

grow up to be an abuser that isn't the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.110 
grow up to be an abuser that isn't the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
case always it's really the other way

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.810 
case always it's really the other way
around<00:01:43.690> if<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> person<00:01:45.160> who<00:01:45.520> is
