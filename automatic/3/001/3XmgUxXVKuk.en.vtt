is how you turn around this is your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.780 
is how you turn around this is your
source<00:00:51.150> of<00:00:51.390> power<00:00:51.740> right<00:00:52.740> there<00:00:52.830> now<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
source of power right there now it's

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.210 
source of power right there now it's
open<00:00:54.260> I'll<00:00:55.260> show<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.470> how<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> real

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
open I'll show you how I make this real

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.300 
open I'll show you how I make this real
quick<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.870> uncover<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.079> level<00:00:58.410> alright<00:00:59.160> so

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
quick just uncover this level alright so

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.870 
quick just uncover this level alright so
basically<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.540> by<00:01:01.350> either

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
basically all of this by either

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.219 
basically all of this by either
basically<00:01:02.880> all<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.690> whetstone<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
basically all this is just whetstone and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.569 
basically all this is just whetstone and
rest<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.680> repeaters<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> need<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
rest and repeaters all you need the

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.249 
rest and repeaters all you need the
repeaters<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.990> work<00:01:07.079> if

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
repeaters here so all this can work if

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.080 
repeaters here so all this can work if
you<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.400> stone<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:08.939> will

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you just have one stone here this will

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
you just have one stone here this will
not<00:01:09.240> work<00:01:09.270> it'll<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.079> open<00:01:10.590> two<00:01:11.249> or

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
not work it'll just like open two or

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.789 
not work it'll just like open two or
three<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.819> then<00:01:12.170> there<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.229> closed<00:01:13.499> again

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
three and then there was closed again

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
three and then there was closed again
but<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:15.929> here<00:01:16.079> is<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
but this part right here is going to be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
but this part right here is going to be
the<00:01:16.859> most<00:01:17.039> important<00:01:17.579> part<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.909> else<00:01:17.999> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the most important part or else this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.539 
the most important part or else this
will<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.569> work<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.560> watched<00:01:20.310> another

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
will not work if you watched another

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
will not work if you watched another
lead<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.179> it<00:01:21.569> looks<00:01:21.749> exactly<00:01:21.899> like

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lead on this and it looks exactly like

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
lead on this and it looks exactly like
this<00:01:22.710> you're<00:01:23.429> wrong<00:01:23.639> and<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.270> patched<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.719> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this you're wrong and it patched it on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.819 
this you're wrong and it patched it on
the<00:01:25.079> 360<00:01:25.560> version<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:26.420> Minecraft<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.719> xbox<00:01:28.380> 360

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
the pc what they did patch that version

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.999 
the pc what they did patch that version
on<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.329> can't<00:01:33.569> make<00:01:33.749> the<00:01:33.929> floor<00:01:34.799> by<00:01:34.979> floor

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
on you can't make the floor by floor

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.639 
on you can't make the floor by floor
area<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.090> use<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> redstone<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.499> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
area and then use that redstone with the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.050 
area and then use that redstone with the
grass<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.310> stuff<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.579> doesn't<00:01:38.969> work

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
grass and stuff it just doesn't work

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.669 
grass and stuff it just doesn't work
anymore<00:01:39.359> I<00:01:39.509> tried<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.139> I<00:01:40.829> failed<00:01:41.399> epicly

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
anymore I tried it and I failed epicly

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.469 
anymore I tried it and I failed epicly
every<00:01:43.679> way<00:01:43.770> um<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.429> it's<00:01:47.429> all<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.240> exact

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
every way um so it's all it's the exact

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
every way um so it's all it's the exact
same<00:01:48.509> looks<00:01:48.929> on<00:01:49.139> that<00:01:49.350> side<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:50.700> looks<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
same looks on that side it looks the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
same looks on that side it looks the
exact<00:01:51.539> same<00:01:51.719> way<00:01:52.520> except<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.670> repeater<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
exact same way except more repeater and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.699 
exact same way except more repeater and
then<00:01:54.539> there's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.749> repeater<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
then there's a repeater right there and

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.480 
then there's a repeater right there and
that<00:01:57.170> leads<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.319> that<00:01:58.799> lever<00:01:59.039> down<00:01:59.249> there

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that leads to that lever down there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.599 
that leads to that lever down there

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.630 
it but other than that it will be a
secret<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.940> my<00:03:48.239> advice<00:03:48.300> for<00:03:49.489> keeping<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.580> a

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
secret so my advice for keeping this a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120 
secret so my advice for keeping this a
secret<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.270> put<00:03:52.140> hills<00:03:52.380> here<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:52.980> looks

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
secret is put hills here so it looks

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.180 
secret is put hills here so it looks
natural<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.850> them<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.570> environment

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
natural and them in the environment

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.970 
natural and them in the environment

do that also you can make a button with
this<00:04:19.230> but<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.500> really<00:04:19.709> doesn't<00:04:19.890> work<00:04:20.100> that

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
this but it really doesn't work that

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.190 
this but it really doesn't work that
well<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.669> can<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:20.910> put<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.989> make<00:04:22.109> it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
well and you can like put in you make it

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.990 
well and you can like put in you make it
like<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> pit<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:22.950> put<00:04:23.100> water<00:04:23.400> down<00:04:23.700> here

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
like a pit and then put water down here

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.880 
like a pit and then put water down here
and<00:04:24.180> then<00:04:24.270> i<00:04:24.480> have<00:04:25.020> my<00:04:25.050> button<00:04:25.500> like<00:04:25.650> right
