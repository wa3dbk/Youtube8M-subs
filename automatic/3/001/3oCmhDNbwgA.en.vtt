00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 hey people what could have been there before 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 we went to steffan today 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.000
 it's probably about a dlc pack in it 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.430
 the next days will be the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.260
 a Christmas dlc pack is for everyone 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.220
 do not they want to be gespoilert 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 should we now only times 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 switch off because here are some 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 Things that already anticipate a lot 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 which probably appears with the dlc 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.519
 I can still do it with let's go 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 mention that it is actually safe 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 that it will come here now but 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.320
 not 100% clear is what it is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.969
 everything comes with its own mine 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.809
 first screenshot of a forum 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.120
 was posted 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 you can see the jc penney male 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 a christmas hat and otherwise too 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.480
 relatively festively dressed on the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.340
 snowy street the clothing the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 will be real you know the christmas 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.719
 Clothing in any case in the game 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.699
 but will really be the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 entire map in the snow world 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.090
 that still makes me relatively unclear 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 think it's a bit too much 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.480
 Maybe I do not think so 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 But everyone will do it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.539
 do a cool action and come 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.589
 to garments that just 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.270
 been addressed 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.030
 Of course, there are some for men 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 and what women as you can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.240
 for example, as Christmas 11 or 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 disguised as Santa Claus 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 that would be really cool if someone 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 painted santa claus 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.409
 lobby would have and millions of dollars as 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 Christmas present to the players 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 I would think that will give away 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.869
 still make some money and also the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.860
 Women have relatively cool clothes 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 you can see that we are in 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 background can definitely be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.600
 to form his own opinion but me 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 like the garments like that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 Overall good in any case otherwise 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.689
 I think that one more is one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 Standard fabric come as well as with the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.850
 other dlcs for example some 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 missions on snow maps and the whole 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 is still not 100 percent clear 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 I can do that very much 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 very well imagine what rockstar is still 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 could do the entire map instead 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 transforming a snow wall is one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 in quotation marks legal access 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.579
 had to give according to the latest thinking 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.320
 there you already have snow 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.939
 city ​​that looks really hot always 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.740
 want for christmas definitely 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.450
 could use and there you have to now 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 just come without a bell 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 that we definitely have something cool 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.670
 if the do it so that's to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.840
 from this video too much information 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 That was not it but it was still 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 not as much 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.379
 hand given that will be the next 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 See you in any case 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.459
 I'm still interested in what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 you hope for the christmas dlc 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.159
 would write me any wishes no matter how 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.900
 crazy who are in the comments 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.330
 First, you look over the Christmas holidays 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.489
 in the chip online does not have to kill 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.140
 or that rockstar to everyone 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.580
 Christmas present distributed or only on 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 they have never been a spoilsport 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.730
 In any case write me everything 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.099
 I'm curious that 's it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.099

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.120
