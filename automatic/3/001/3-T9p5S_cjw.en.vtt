00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello how about I am an active action leader 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.840
 within the psychology faculty of 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.180
 the university alternates signal 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.920
 and I bring you a video to support 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.600
 those parents who have children with 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.270
 problems in learning the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.650
 literacy 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 the same similar 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.360
 there are concerned parents 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.580
 that their sons or daughters are lagging behind 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.440
 in reading or in writing and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.200
 they feel that the teacher does not 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.010
 enough attention to the child in the classroom and 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.559
 the effect cater to 20 30 or more children not 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.269
 it's simple task suddenly you can not 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.309
 get all children to go to 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.800
 same level so it turns out 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.739
 very important the support of parents 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.080
 for the child in attention to this is that 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.840
 I bring you this playful activity that 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.020
 you can use at home this is the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.969
 syllabic domain the syllabic domain yes 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.399
 it can be adapted to different types 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.440
 of literacy levels in this 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.660
 occasion we recommend it for children who 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 they are at the syllabic level 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.890
 alphabetically what does this mean 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.530
 that the child already knows the vowels and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.560
 most of the consonants and starts to 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.659
 assign a letter for each sound but 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.030
 still it continues adding a letter for 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.630
 some syllables for example for 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 write the syllable I could put it alone 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.930
 the letter o or to write the syllable 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.940
 for could I just put the letter p are 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 well children that have a good progress 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.200
 but they need a lot of practice 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.170
 in this way a domino is performed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.240
 with syllables the activity consists of going 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 finding words for the child 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.759
 go identifying how they are formed is very 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 important that the child understands what 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.759
 is doing there is a huge amount of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.280
 syllables that can be used let's start 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.799
 with those that form words that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.899
 be of the environment of the child ie 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.599
 we can take vocabulary words 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.349
 of the child himself and break them down into 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.470
 syllables for example hand mom mouth 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.500
 etcetera and in this way we assemble the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.019
 dominoes as well at the time of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 reading them will mean something to him 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.690
 child and learning will be more durable 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.720
 in this way the chips are prepared 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.610
 of the domino this time they were made 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.280
 chips of different color like to 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.069
 identify each player's 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 here it looks like in a part they put 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.790
 vowels for other syllables syllables that are 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 simple they get different to go 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.959
 putting together the words 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.770
 then they separate the ones from a 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.280
 player and those of the other is very important 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.040
 put the child in front of the cards 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.770
 suppose that on this occasion the color 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.620
 orange is from the child and the pink is from the 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.110
 mom or the papacy of the person who goes 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.390
 to be playing with the child then he 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.760
 they will separate the letters 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.130
 and they are then placed facing each 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.270
 player that's why I'm putting the roses 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.040
 blue face up are also put the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.490
 orange color that are with those that will 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.130
 play the child and you start to either 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.240
 of the two people can think 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.840
 regularly the first game then 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.200
 the adult person begins the one in 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.540
 this case is accompanying the child 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:53.890
 then the child can already choose one of 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.050
 the letters and see if a word forms 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.110
 this time, for example, the 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.360
 word car is important to bring a 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.150
 record go by writing down the words that you 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.870
 find for the end that the child sees 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:12.580
 everything he managed to get from the domino and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.640
 not all armed cards can 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.590
 to find a word that generates 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.639
 that has a meaning for example in 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:26.740
 this ina occasion would be like nothing 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.900
 then then you continue with the game and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.570
 only those that do register 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.550
 have a meaning you can put on 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.720
 horizontally or vertically as in 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.409
 this house case would be in this way 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.429
 vertical 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:47.349
 it is the mother's turn and the 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.349
 word the word foot is formed 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.710
 then the child's turn in another way 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:02.000
 once this vertical would form the word 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.750
 cat and so on are you going playing 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.750
 with the chips 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.400
 is reporting the greater than the greater 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.660
 possible quantity 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.190
 of words 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.140
 it is very important to have patience in 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.660
 respect your times recognize your 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.000
 efforts can suddenly make you 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.290
 possible to identify the word 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.870
 especially at the beginning but mom dad 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.510
 remember if the child already knew how to read 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.000
 you will need this didactic resource 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.400
 we need to go little by little through the 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.820
 game with the syllabic domain and by 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.010
 supposedly with your support making it go 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.650
 identifying how syllables are formed 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.650
 and how are you united with the words 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.790
 finally I would like to add that at 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.040
 principle the syllables are simple but 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.190
 as the child becomes familiar with 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.760
 they are being replaced so that 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.950
 go practicing with new words 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.919
 integrating chips with complex syllables 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.250
 always taking care to go to the level of the child 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.530
 without pressing it too much since it is 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.630
 a support resource and this one is going to 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.260
 achieve if the child sees it more as a 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.210
 I play that as an obligation and good 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.729
 Here is a domino game 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.270
 syllabic I hope you serve them with your 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.270
 little ones 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.520
 do not 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.810
 do not 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.650
 and
