video of Infinity Blade 3 so last time

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.620 
video of Infinity Blade 3 so last time
in<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> last<00:00:05.549> video<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.089> failed<00:00:06.420> again<00:00:06.770> so<00:00:08.630> why

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
in the last video we failed again so why

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.120 
in the last video we failed again so why
should<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.990> played<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.380> level<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.769> couple<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
should I played this level a couple of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.789 
should I played this level a couple of
times<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.690> it<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.870> getting<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.349> bit<00:00:13.559> difficult

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
times so it is getting a bit difficult

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.129 
times so it is getting a bit difficult
but<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.730> keep<00:00:14.880> trying<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.450> guess<00:00:15.690> you'll

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but if you keep trying I guess you'll

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.740 
but if you keep trying I guess you'll
probably<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> chance<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.490> winning<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> now

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
probably have a chance at winning it now

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.010 
probably have a chance at winning it now
we're<00:00:18.960> gonna<00:00:19.080> try<00:00:19.320> once<00:00:19.560> again<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:21.020> we

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we're gonna try once again to see if we

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.810 
we're gonna try once again to see if we
are<00:00:22.470> able<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> beat<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:25.039> boss<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.490> don't

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
