reason<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.610> making<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.910> video<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.509> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
reason I'm making this video because I

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.420 
reason I'm making this video because I
haven't<00:00:16.109> even<00:00:16.260> made<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> review<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.190> yet

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
haven't even made a review for this yet

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.450 
haven't even made a review for this yet
but<00:00:18.090> because<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:18.840> pretty<00:00:19.380> sure<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
but because I'm pretty sure I have a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300 
but because I'm pretty sure I have a
busted<00:00:21.300> rotor<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> show<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
busted rotor so I'm going to show you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.599 
busted rotor so I'm going to show you
how<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.789> replace<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:25.099> let<00:00:26.099> me<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.400> show<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
how to replace that let me just show you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.870 
how to replace that let me just show you
why<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:28.550> turn<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:31.309> here<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.579> its

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
why I think I do turn it on here on its

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.799 
why I think I do turn it on here on its
box<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.800> tried<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.000> adjust<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
box now I tried to adjust it with the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
box now I tried to adjust it with the
trim<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:37.410> I'd<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> trim<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
trim which I'd do it just the trim and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
trim which I'd do it just the trim and
that<00:00:39.120> did<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.329> work<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.930> here's<00:00:40.200> what

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that did not work at all but here's what

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.750 
that did not work at all but here's what
happens<00:00:46.760> okay<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.620> went<00:00:49.620> through

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
happens okay so I went through

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.110 
happens okay so I went through
instructions<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.520> said<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> would

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
instructions and it said that I would

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.819 
instructions and it said that I would
probably<00:00:54.420> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> replace<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:56.370> rotor

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
probably need to replace the rotor

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:30.160 
probably need to replace the rotor
luckily<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.609> box<00:01:00.020> there's

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.760 

alright<00:01:32.750> doesn't<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.840> direct<00:01:33.960> instructions

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
alright doesn't have direct instructions

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.270 
alright doesn't have direct instructions
but<00:01:35.100> oh<00:01:35.960> alright<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.260> got<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.800> knife<00:01:40.130> which<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
but oh alright so got my knife which is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.890 
but oh alright so got my knife which is
a<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.580> bit<00:01:41.670> unnecessary<00:01:41.910> but<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.660> have

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
a little bit unnecessary but you have

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.080 
a little bit unnecessary but you have
any<00:01:43.050> citizen<00:01:43.410> laying<00:01:43.800> around<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.640> bag

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
any citizen laying around and this bag

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:57.499 
any citizen laying around and this bag
was<00:01:45.870> open<00:01:53.510> side

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.459 

extruders<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.329> tool<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.109> think<00:02:02.320> this

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
extruders and the tool and I think this

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.899 
extruders and the tool and I think this
is<00:02:02.590> just<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.890> pry<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.189> off<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.310> I'm<00:02:06.579> just<00:02:06.609> gonna

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
is just a pry it off so I'm just gonna

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.529 
is just a pry it off so I'm just gonna
do<00:02:07.030> that

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
do that

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.690 
do that
and<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.560> think<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.599> pry<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.660> out<00:02:11.700> hopefully

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and I think I just pry it out hopefully

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.850 
and I think I just pry it out hopefully
this<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.150> right

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:29.570 

maybe<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.550> isn't

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.290

as the video ended so all you do is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.240 
as the video ended so all you do is
