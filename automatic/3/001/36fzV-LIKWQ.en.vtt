that<00:01:08.330> Jimbo<00:01:09.679> is<00:01:10.679> pretty<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.310> known<00:01:11.550> as<00:01:11.789> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that Jimbo is pretty well known as a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
that Jimbo is pretty well known as a
sculptor<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> an<00:01:13.440> installation<00:01:13.860> artist<00:01:15.380> but

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
sculptor and an installation artist but

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.730 
sculptor and an installation artist but
he'd<00:01:17.039> stop<00:01:17.369> painting<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.149> said<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.740> 30

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
he'd stop painting they said about 30

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.540 
he'd stop painting they said about 30
years<00:01:20.009> ago<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.250> makes<00:01:23.399> me

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
years ago and it's kind of makes me

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.300 
years ago and it's kind of makes me
think<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.940> Picasso

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
think of a Picasso

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430 
think of a Picasso
anyway<00:01:26.310> he<00:01:26.970> secretly<00:01:27.420> started<00:01:28.229> painting

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
anyway he secretly started painting

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.469 
anyway he secretly started painting
again<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:29.070> four<00:01:29.369> years<00:01:29.490> ago<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:32.479> this

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
again about four years ago and so this

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.649 
again about four years ago and so this
is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> selection<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.470> small<00:01:35.659> oil

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
is a selection of his small oil

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.310 
is a selection of his small oil
paintings

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.179 

most<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.470> these<00:01:47.560> pieces<00:01:47.890> are<00:01:48.189> fairly<00:01:48.460> small<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
most of these pieces are fairly small so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.440 
most of these pieces are fairly small so
something<00:01:51.189> like<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.580> probably<00:01:52.149> maybe

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
something like that is probably maybe

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.770 
something like that is probably maybe
six<00:01:52.899> by<00:01:53.140> eight<00:01:53.170> inches<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.890> really<00:01:57.189> nice

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
six by eight inches that's really nice

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.310 
six by eight inches that's really nice
and<00:02:00.750> he's<00:02:01.750> actually<00:02:02.080> attracted<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:04.320> pretty

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and he's actually attracted a pretty

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.300 
and he's actually attracted a pretty
good<00:02:05.530> amount<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:06.009> critical<00:02:06.909> response<00:02:07.270> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
good amount of critical response and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.440 
good amount of critical response and
people<00:02:09.310> are<00:02:09.399> looking<00:02:09.489> at<00:02:09.759> these<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.090> saying

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
people are looking at these and saying

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.880 
people are looking at these and saying
that<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:12.400> echoes<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:13.350> some<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.500> great

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.509 

British<00:02:19.950> atmospheric<00:02:20.950> painters<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.489> Turner

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
British atmospheric painters like Turner

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.270 
British atmospheric painters like Turner
or<00:02:24.519> some<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:27.239> other<00:02:29.280> nineteenth-century

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
or some of the other nineteenth-century

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.390 
or some of the other nineteenth-century
American<00:02:31.209> artists<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.959> kind<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.890> coming<00:02:33.280> out

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
American artists that kind of coming out

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.330 
American artists that kind of coming out
of<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:35.310> dark<00:02:36.310> native<00:02:37.110> mysticism<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.340> Ryder

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
of the dark native mysticism like Ryder

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:49.140 
of the dark native mysticism like Ryder
&amp;<00:02:39.700> Blakelock<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:48.730> one<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
&amp; Blakelock but I think one of the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.240 
&amp; Blakelock but I think one of the
interesting<00:02:49.239> things<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:49.989> Jimbo<00:02:50.920> also

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
interesting things is that Jimbo also

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.099 
interesting things is that Jimbo also
has<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.459> kind<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.940> an<00:02:52.109> abstract<00:02:54.720> strain<00:02:55.720> going

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
has a kind of an abstract strain going

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.280 
has a kind of an abstract strain going
on<00:02:56.260> here<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> lot<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.829> these<00:02:57.010> works<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:58.299> in

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
on here with a lot of these works and in

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.690 
on here with a lot of these works and in
that<00:02:59.530> way<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.010> would<00:03:00.310> also<00:03:02.190> wear<00:03:03.190> offensive

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
that way I would also wear offensive

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.830 
that way I would also wear offensive
artists<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:05.760> Forrest<00:03:06.760> best

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.410 

some<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.830> these<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.400> make<00:03:11.730> me<00:03:11.970> think<00:03:12.240> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
some of these kind of make me think of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.140 
some of these kind of make me think of
landscape<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.920> way<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.610> little

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
landscape and in that way I'm a little

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.190 
landscape and in that way I'm a little
echo<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.630> maybe<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.990> Milton<00:03:22.470> Avery<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:24.050> like<00:03:25.050> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
echo of maybe a Milton Avery I like the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.840 
echo of maybe a Milton Avery I like the
color<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.800> one

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.230 

now<00:03:34.850> that's<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.690> give<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.990> a<00:03:37.120> reading<00:03:38.120> of

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
now that's got to give you a reading of

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.050 
now that's got to give you a reading of
the<00:03:38.360> landscape<00:03:38.960> it's<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.380> sunset<00:03:40.060> also

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
the landscape it's like a sunset also

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.790 
the landscape it's like a sunset also
makes<00:03:41.360> me<00:03:41.540> think<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.870> little<00:03:41.990> bit<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.470> maybe

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
makes me think a little bit of it maybe

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:53.070 
makes me think a little bit of it maybe
Phil<00:03:43.160> Gustin<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:43.910> if<00:03:44.060> his<00:03:44.210> late<00:03:44.450> paintings<00:03:51.670> and

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
Phil Gustin so if his late paintings and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.320 
Phil Gustin so if his late paintings and
but<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:54.110> think<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.530> have<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.580> have<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.940> admire

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
but I think I have to I have to admire

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.830 
but I think I have to I have to admire
