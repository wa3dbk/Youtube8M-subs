00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.190 
the green Tiger controller this one I
had<00:02:04.590> much<00:02:04.860> better<00:02:05.040> luck<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.329> got

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
had much better luck with this one got

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580 
had much better luck with this one got
to<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> proposed

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to me and about you know the proposed

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
to me and about you know the proposed
time<00:02:10.860> about<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.550> half<00:02:11.580> almost<00:02:11.970> three

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
time about two and a half almost three

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
time about two and a half almost three
weeks

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
weeks

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.280 
weeks
um<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.880> customized<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.840> little<00:02:16.080> more

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
um this one I customized a little more

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790 
um this one I customized a little more
but<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.460> was<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.790> modded<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.410> leads<00:02:19.650> me

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
but it was not modded so that leads me

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
but it was not modded so that leads me
to<00:02:20.100> believe<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.450> mod<00:02:21.690> had<00:02:21.900> something<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
to believe that the mod had something to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020 
to believe that the mod had something to
do<00:02:22.380> with<00:02:22.560> my<00:02:22.800> controller<00:02:23.280> getting<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:23.850> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
do with my controller getting here a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.840 
do with my controller getting here a
little<00:02:24.360> late<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.200> know<00:02:25.320> maybe<00:02:25.580> maybe<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
little late you know maybe maybe the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.910 
little late you know maybe maybe the
putting<00:02:27.570> mod<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.320> getting<00:02:28.620> everything

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
putting mod in and getting everything

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.230 
putting mod in and getting everything
all<00:02:29.070> programmed<00:02:29.490> whatever<00:02:29.760> maybe<00:02:29.940> maybe

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
all programmed whatever maybe maybe

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.030 
all programmed whatever maybe maybe
that's<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> problem<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.410> know<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.800> got

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that's the problem so you know I got

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's the problem so you know I got
green<00:02:35.520> Tiger<00:02:35.760> controller<00:02:37.400> green<00:02:38.400> Tiger<00:02:38.700> got

painted<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.380> now<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:26.490> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
painted but as of right now with the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.880 
painted but as of right now with the
back<00:03:26.910> being<00:03:27.210> painted<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> little

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
back being painted it is a little

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.860 
back being painted it is a little
difficult<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.400> get<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.670> battery<00:03:29.940> pack<00:03:30.000> off<00:03:30.390> so

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
difficult to get the battery pack off so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.870 
difficult to get the battery pack off so
if<00:03:31.110> they<00:03:31.260> painted<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.010> battery<00:03:32.340> pack<00:03:32.400> it'd<00:03:32.760> be

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
if they painted the battery pack it'd be

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
if they painted the battery pack it'd be
impossible<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.420> get<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:34.740> got

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
impossible to get it out so you got

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150 
impossible to get it out so you got
anything<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.340> keep<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.580> in<00:03:35.640> mind<00:03:35.930> um<00:03:37.160> green

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
anything to keep that in mind um green

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.950 
anything to keep that in mind um green
