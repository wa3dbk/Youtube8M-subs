00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
something that I saw on Pinterest a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.100 
something that I saw on Pinterest a
little<00:00:09.590> while<00:00:09.710> back<00:00:10.269> it's<00:00:11.269> like<00:00:11.450> a<00:00:11.540> big<00:00:11.719> fat

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
little while back it's like a big fat

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.259 
little while back it's like a big fat
side<00:00:12.589> braid<00:00:12.860> I'll<00:00:13.309> go<00:00:13.759> ahead<00:00:13.849> and<00:00:14.000> post<00:00:14.150> a

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
side braid I'll go ahead and post a

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.620 
side braid I'll go ahead and post a
picture<00:00:14.480> also<00:00:14.839> of<00:00:15.110> my<00:00:15.320> inspiration<00:00:16.600> so<00:00:17.600> I

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
picture also of my inspiration so I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.300 
picture also of my inspiration so I
think<00:00:17.780> it's<00:00:18.080> best<00:00:18.260> to<00:00:18.380> start<00:00:18.710> with<00:00:18.800> really<00:00:19.160> big

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
think it's best to start with really big

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.609 
think it's best to start with really big
hair<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:19.760> as<00:00:20.000> you<00:00:20.119> can<00:00:20.269> see<00:00:20.480> they<00:00:21.260> have<00:00:21.410> really

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
hair and as you can see they have really

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.000 
hair and as you can see they have really
big<00:00:21.769> hair<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.220> slept<00:00:22.789> on<00:00:22.939> this<00:00:23.090> last<00:00:23.359> night<00:00:23.599> with

big hair I slept on this last night with

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.410 
big hair I slept on this last night with
little<00:00:25.010> buds<00:00:25.340> in<00:00:25.519> my<00:00:25.609> head<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.000> this<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:26.269> what

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
little buds in my head and this is what

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.950 
little buds in my head and this is what
happens

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960
