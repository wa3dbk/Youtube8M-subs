but<00:00:08.910> let's<00:00:09.090> look<00:00:09.480> at<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> very<00:00:10.290> important

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
but let's look at a very important

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.940 
but let's look at a very important
principle<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.480> test<00:00:12.750> Scripture<00:00:13.440> against

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
principle is to test Scripture against

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.470 
principle is to test Scripture against
scripture<00:00:15.859> scripture<00:00:16.859> has<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> human

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
scripture scripture has a lot of human

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.929 
scripture scripture has a lot of human
authors<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.050> only<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.590> ultimate<00:00:19.800> author<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
authors but only one ultimate author the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
authors but only one ultimate author the
Holy<00:00:21.119> Spirit<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.810> therefore<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> scripture

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
Holy Spirit so therefore the scripture

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.240 
Holy Spirit so therefore the scripture
doesn't<00:00:22.830> contradict<00:00:23.490> itself<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
doesn't contradict itself and the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.359 
doesn't contradict itself and the
scripture<00:00:26.640> rather<00:00:26.880> explains<00:00:27.480> itself<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.410> one

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
scripture rather explains itself and one

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.030 
scripture rather explains itself and one
good<00:00:29.820> idea<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> closest

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
good idea is to look at the closest

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.420 
good idea is to look at the closest
passage<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:33.090> Genesis<00:00:33.780> 1<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> terms<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
passage to Genesis 1 in terms of the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.450 
passage to Genesis 1 in terms of the
structure<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> closest<00:00:38.250> one

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
structure of it and for the closest one

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.920 
structure of it and for the closest one
is<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.180> passage<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> numbers<00:00:40.379> 7

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
is actually the passage of numbers 7

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.990 
is actually the passage of numbers 7
because<00:00:42.930> both<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.190> structure

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
because both of them have a structure

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.549 
because both of them have a structure
account<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.440> number<00:00:47.010> days<00:00:48.559> see

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
account and they have number days see

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
account and they have number days see
what<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:51.210> account<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.899> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what you have here these are numbered

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
what you have here these are numbered
consecutive<00:01:34.409> days<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
consecutive days just like you have in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.410 
consecutive days just like you have in
Genesis<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.250> here's<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:38.610> no<00:01:39.180> one

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
Genesis one and here's the thing no one

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
Genesis one and here's the thing no one
looking<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.810> passage<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.680> say<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
looking at this passage would say that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.389 
looking at this passage would say that
these<00:01:41.490> days<00:01:41.820> were<00:01:42.030> millions<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> years<00:01:42.600> long

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
these days were millions of years long

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.920 
these days were millions of years long
so<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> took<00:01:44.640> 12<00:01:44.850> billion<00:01:45.090> years<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> dedicate

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so it took 12 billion years to dedicate

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
so it took 12 billion years to dedicate
the<00:01:46.020> tabernacle<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> why<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> problem

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the tabernacle so why is there a problem

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
the tabernacle so why is there a problem
a<00:01:49.049> Genesis<00:01:49.409> 1<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:49.740> has<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> same<00:01:50.189> sort<00:01:50.490> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a Genesis 1 which has the same sort of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
a Genesis 1 which has the same sort of
structure<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.780> only<00:01:51.960> reason<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
structure the only reason is not from a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
structure the only reason is not from a
text<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.820> people<00:01:54.420> bringing<00:01:54.750> outside

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
text is from people bringing outside

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.910 
text is from people bringing outside
ideas<00:01:55.649> upon<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.399> text<00:01:56.990> instead<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> God

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
ideas upon the text instead of God

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.459 
ideas upon the text instead of God
