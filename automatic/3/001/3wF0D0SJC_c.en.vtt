 hello to everyone with you sign and today I 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 I will translate 10 simple rules for you g 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.040
 bane antinous which override will help 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 you win more games juice and do not speak 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.370
 what is the only thing that he will need 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.469
 or that this is the most significant thing no 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 but since you have already voiced smart 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 thoughts on how to raise l alone 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 a champion or why not to brand 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 on teammates and much more I decided you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 tell about ten tricks which 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 people usually know but often forget 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.779
 I am sure that they will help you win 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 more games than you previously won 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.050
 let's start 10 no matter what 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 play your strongest champions 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 those whom you have studied are best not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 pikee first time africa in ranked 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
 just because it is open to you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 They say that you have a much better chance 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 check your team playing your own 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 favorite hero you train once 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.640
 infection than the so -called opi 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 experience of the game which you are much more 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.219
 less and do not listen to anyone who pleads 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.690
 bum and small fidel times and we lose 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 treat your teammates with respect 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 but don't let them push themselves on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.170
 thoughtless actions that may 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 end badly for the team for can 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 of you point 10 is not new but many 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.159
 he is often forgotten 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 number nine principle it depends on 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.180
 who do you play but take on average 3 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 it is your rule to take your crowds 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 control proteins at the first level reason 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.689
 is that with a crowd control protein you 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.020
 do more damage than damaging 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.130
 haze just due to a couple of auto attack 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.259
 Champions majority there is no need of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.909
 proteins in memory at the first level 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.770
 more if you are a mono user and control 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 bilko allow in turn 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 your banki.ru or you kill 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 if your jungler lose hans on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 the second level is for champions 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 like ari but if other champions like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 the raid of which crowd control squirrels have 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 short action on the first levels 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.229
 and the cooldown on them is huge while 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.820
 he gave the monk just a couple of seconds so 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.890
 you must always understand what order you are 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 take and why number eight start 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.500
 yuzat marco st i advise you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.719
 reassign your standard qw and r-on 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.530
 smartcast and your normal caste swap 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.450
 on shift pvr 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.009
 this will allow you to give a default 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.350
 smartcast and but leaves opportunity 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.900
 use normal caste on champions 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 on which you really need to eat 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.950
 Of course, the exclusion of nectar champions 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.780
 perfect start but for most 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.620
 champions you will do more damage 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.690
 more kill 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 save more teammates and less 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.739
 die if you will if you take away 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 yourself off the road those split seconds 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.180
 necessary to use normal 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.040
 cast of course nightmare cast need 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.019
 getting used to but creating these fractions of a second 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.820
 a huge difference between about equal 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:48.160
 skill opponents when you play 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:50.230
 Soloku number 7 I just had to 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.959
 say this do not forget to ward 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.540
 wards win games proved it 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.330
 British scientists it's trite but it's 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 true if you get out of bronze you 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.920
 you can win games just for wardi all 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.540
 map here's a little sly right 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.340
 hordes when you try to ward in 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.700
 bushes something your cursor will be painted in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.310
 green and blue if you put 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.440
 pay ward outside bushes number six 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.450
 attention to the game at the stage of peaks and bans 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.220
 anybody played big enough 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.769
 the number of games will tell you that at least 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.769
 time yes that guy came across 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.170
 which either of during the bans either 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.000
 slept ban slept over looked at this 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.440
 time the hub then on y tube forgot 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.900
 change run forgot to change masters and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.920
 etc. etc. etc. and so will not be 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 that guy 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.120
 This is the most basic way to lose. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.040
 the game will not find that anti africa filter 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.200
 protect you or you make there 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.660
 a random peak there will kick you out in the lobby 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.269
 putting peaks and bans is also part of the game 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.340
 requires your full attention always 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.100
 remember the words of the sun from the art of war 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.380
 warriors winners always win first 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.359
 then go to war and losers of war 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.640
 first go to war and only then look for 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.100
 opportunity to win number five of 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.140
 discharge low-level tipsov always do 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.420
 something that will bring you more gold for 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.329
 mostly it concerns the last hit of fins 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.709
 hit more important than kill opponent of course 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.090
 if your opponent plays weak 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.250
 makes many mistakes allows 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.319
 Harass yourself of course kill him but 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.910
 try to harass the enemy by saving your 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.920
 creepstat on top 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.920
 since it is scream 100 that gives you tons 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.830
 gold they are x 1 x 1 turn without 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.630
 skills will not bring you anything on this 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.850
 lines the reason for my victory is that i 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.310
 far ahead of the enemy 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.280
 creeps i don't let him farm and guy 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.930
 At the same time, I myself won not because 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.760
 that i have more hop and damage but because 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.680
 that we crypstat gives me more damage and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.680
 big again Christ from the enemy gives him 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.360
 number four if you haven't already 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.580
 done then go to settings 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.710
 interface and maximize 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.720
 the size of your minimap at the same time 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.400
 reducing other interface details as well 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.650
 as much as possible for your view 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
 this will allow you to see a larger area 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.759
 the game card used to respond to 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.800
 Ganks get a couple of precious seconds 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.900
 in case of sudden events 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.460
 near you an enlarged minimap will 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.960
 more rush was over and you will become 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.150
 notice more events on her 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.229
 occurring in turn decrease 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.699
 chateau will allow you less 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.849
 focus on dromi in it 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.099
 happening on spammers on fly 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.599
 they will no longer distract you tips 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.419
 number three you may have seen in many 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.580
 video on league of legends do not fight places 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.320
 where enemies have more vision and this 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.289
 it would seem simple advice but it is real 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.120
 helps you in many games if you 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.770
 no vision, no control over the map 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.030
 the enemy team just gets 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.409
 advantage having the ability 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.389
 plan your actions 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.520
 so don't fight places without vision 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.409
 this rule worked 500 years before our 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.970
 era rule running starcraft it 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.860
 rule works in league of legends 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.810
 my advice number two is one of 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.440
 most important listen to your 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.570
 instinct 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 trust your feelings if you see 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.289
 that the enemy retreated noticing you and you 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.659
 think yes probably for you and important 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.300
 it seems that you are in vain about standing in the bushes 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.949
 that is exactly how you will be a smart person 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.139
 you must understand that the enemy 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.990
 probably not dumber than you so 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.380
 act as your tells you 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.039
 instincts and my main advice on playing 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.440
 league of legends 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.440
 it's playing for fun it sounds 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.419
 trite but true it is a game of games 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.979
 play for fun main 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.110
 the reason why we all play with you 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.800
 the league is that the league brings us 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.750
 pleasure 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.180
 if you focus on playing in 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.440
 pleasure cultivating in the right 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.840
 direction making certain 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.539
 actions you will achieve much more 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.979
 high results and you will 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.570
 to progress professionally 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.070
 much faster than you would 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.320
 engaged in an unloved affair 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.759
 frame freestyle fail I 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.740
 I hope you enjoyed this video and you 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.419
 discovered yourself something new although I understand 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.969
 that many of you have all these things for a long time 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.210
 knew but still many of us are so easy 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:47.650
 it 's overlooked 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.419
 if you have not subscribed to the channel 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.669
