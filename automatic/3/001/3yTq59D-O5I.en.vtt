you've got some current you need some
stopping<00:00:38.219> power<00:00:38.399> I'll<00:00:39.000> bump<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.780> little

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
stopping power I'll bump it up a little

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
stopping power I'll bump it up a little
there<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.920> honestly<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.030> probably

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
there but honestly what I'm probably

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.049 
there but honestly what I'm probably
bumping<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> maybe<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
bumping up to is maybe I have a have a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.580 
bumping up to is maybe I have a have a
nine<00:00:45.300> flutter<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.079> beefier

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
nine flutter that's a little beefier

nine flutter that's a little beefier
that<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.590> maybe<00:00:49.590> I'll<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that I use for that and maybe I'll go to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
that I use for that and maybe I'll go to
the<00:00:50.250> 10<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.360> use<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> 11-footer

Wow and you fish that's amazing why
should<00:01:18.090> why<00:01:18.570> should<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> use<00:01:18.990> braid<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
should why should you use braid is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.140 
should why should you use braid is
because<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.689> got<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> very<00:01:22.470> high<00:01:23.060> strength<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
because it's got a very high strength to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.950 
because it's got a very high strength to
diameter<00:01:24.509> ratio<00:01:25.280> when<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> used<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> fish<00:01:26.960> back

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
diameter ratio when I used to fish back

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.880 
diameter ratio when I used to fish back
in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> days<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> mono

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in the days of mono

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
in the days of mono
he's<00:01:29.159> 20<00:01:29.490> pound<00:01:29.729> models<00:01:30.150> probably<00:01:30.479> you're

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
he's 20 pound models probably you're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
he's 20 pound models probably you're
using<00:01:30.810> yes<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.460> I'm<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> 50

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
using yes is that okay so now I'm is 50

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.440 
using yes is that okay so now I'm is 50
pound<00:01:33.299> braid<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:34.979> 50<00:01:35.310> pound<00:01:35.579> braid<00:01:35.909> has<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
pound braid but my 50 pound braid has a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.469 
pound braid but my 50 pound braid has a
diameter<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.259> 12<00:01:37.650> pounds<00:01:38.040> has<00:01:38.189> mono<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> have

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
diameter of 12 pounds has mono so I have

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
diameter of 12 pounds has mono so I have
a<00:01:39.509> thinner<00:01:39.960> line<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.890> got<00:01:41.070> more<00:01:41.220> than

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
a thinner line but it's got more than

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
a thinner line but it's got more than
twice<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.939> strength<00:01:42.270> okay<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.259> one

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
twice the strength okay so there's one

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
twice the strength okay so there's one
winner<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
winner right there you know if you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.580 
winner right there you know if you
should<00:01:45.420> ever<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.380> fish

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
should ever get up you have a good fish

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.280 
should ever get up you have a good fish
up<00:01:46.740> along<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> rocks

twenty pound mono out there you've got
the<00:02:12.710> current<00:02:12.980> moving<00:02:13.460> so<00:02:13.580> now<00:02:13.760> you've<00:02:14.210> got

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the current moving so now you've got

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.090 
the current moving so now you've got
this<00:02:14.540> belly<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.230> line<00:02:15.440> caused<00:02:15.770> by<00:02:16.040> the

gotta<00:02:37.370> tell<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.640> when<00:02:38.060> brake<00:02:38.390> came<00:02:38.630> out<00:02:38.750> in

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
gotta tell you when brake came out in

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.480 
gotta tell you when brake came out in
the<00:02:38.900> mid-90s<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.530> then<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.709> used<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.370> then

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the mid-90s and then I used it and then

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.910 
the mid-90s and then I used it and then
one<00:02:40.670> day<00:02:40.820> went<00:02:41.030> back<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> mono<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.590> felt

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
one day went back to the mono it felt

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.560 
one day went back to the mono it felt
like<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.130> wasn't<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.459> big<00:02:43.700> rubber<00:02:43.940> band<00:02:44.180> that's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
like I wasn't a big rubber band that's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.800 
like I wasn't a big rubber band that's
the<00:02:44.720> way<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.959> felt<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.560> like<00:02:46.630> because<00:02:47.630> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the way it felt it was like because you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.470 
the way it felt it was like because you
get<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.350> used<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.490> good<00:02:49.640> hook<00:02:49.880> set<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
get so used to the good hook set the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000 
get so used to the good hook set the
other<00:02:50.660> part<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.140> no<00:02:51.290> stretch<00:02:51.650> is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
other part of the no stretch is

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.000 
other part of the no stretch is
sensitivity<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.540> feel<00:02:53.900> everything<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.890> mean

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
sensitivity you feel everything you mean

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.130 
sensitivity you feel everything you mean
the<00:02:55.100> graphite<00:02:55.550> rod<00:02:55.790> no<00:02:56.150> stretch<00:02:56.480> line<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the graphite rod no stretch line you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
the graphite rod no stretch line you
feel<00:02:57.410> everything<00:02:57.769> going<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.000> end<00:02:59.120> of

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
feel everything going on on the end of

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.390 
feel everything going on on the end of
your<00:02:59.300> wine<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.900> all<00:03:00.739> right<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.070> that's<00:03:01.220> my

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
your wine so all right so that's my

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.540 
your wine so all right so that's my
grades<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:02.150> know<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> guess<00:03:02.570> as<00:03:03.320> far<00:03:03.350> as<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.280> if

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
grades you know I guess as far as so if

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430 
grades you know I guess as far as so if
you<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.880> problems<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:05.540> braids<00:03:05.810> sometimes

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you have problems with braids sometimes

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.290 
you have problems with braids sometimes
people<00:03:06.709> use<00:03:06.890> grapes<00:03:07.190> all<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.489> got<00:03:07.670> we<00:03:07.790> annonced

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
people use grapes all I got we annonced

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.949 
people use grapes all I got we annonced
out<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:09.340> yeah<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:11.480> don't<00:03:11.570> get<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.840> so

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
out of that yeah you don't get up so

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.479 
out of that yeah you don't get up so
much<00:03:12.080> with<00:03:12.230> bucktails<00:03:12.709> because<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.250> wind

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
much with bucktails because the wind

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.610 
much with bucktails because the wind
knots<00:03:13.700> really<00:03:14.120> occur<00:03:14.540> because<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.170> retrieve

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
knots really occur because you retrieve

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.650 
knots really occur because you retrieve
you<00:03:16.010> are<00:03:16.160> lined<00:03:16.519> without<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> lot<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.269> tension

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
you are lined without a lot of tension

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.780 
you are lined without a lot of tension
on<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:17.989> plugging<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.890> really<00:03:19.280> happens<00:03:19.700> it

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
on it so plugging this really happens it

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.520 
on it so plugging this really happens it
was<00:03:19.880> maybe<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.180> got<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.330> white<00:03:20.510> plug<00:03:20.840> there's

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
was maybe you got a white plug there's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.990 
was maybe you got a white plug there's
not<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> lot<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:21.980> tension<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.489> line<00:03:22.730> when

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
not a lot of tension on the line when

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.729 
not a lot of tension on the line when
you're<00:03:23.090> reeling<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:23.959> long<00:03:24.170> gets<00:03:24.440> wrapped

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
you're reeling it so long gets wrapped

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.370 
you're reeling it so long gets wrapped
on<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:24.980> spool<00:03:25.340> very<00:03:26.000> loosely<00:03:26.390> not<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.080> much<00:03:27.260> of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
on the spool very loosely not so much of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.840 
on the spool very loosely not so much of
a<00:03:27.410> problem<00:03:27.650> with<00:03:27.860> bucktails<00:03:28.340> because<00:03:28.700> they're

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
a problem with bucktails because they're

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.199 
a problem with bucktails because they're
usually

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
usually

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.820

dragging<00:03:29.959> through<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> water<00:03:30.440> there's<00:03:30.680> some

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
dragging through the water there's some

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.009 
dragging through the water there's some
resistance<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.610> line<00:03:32.060> perhaps<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.720> spool

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
resistance on the line perhaps the spool

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.720 
resistance on the line perhaps the spool
a<00:03:33.049> little<00:03:33.380> bit<00:03:33.500> tighter<00:03:33.799> if<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.519> have

really<00:03:42.260> not<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.680> braid<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.340> heat<00:03:43.790> fused<00:03:44.150> line

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
really not a braid is heat fused line

really not a braid is heat fused line
braided<00:03:45.470> line<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:46.100> they<00:03:46.340> take<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.790> strands

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209
