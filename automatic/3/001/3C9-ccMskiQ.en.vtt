Gypsy and you think is in design studio

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.700 
Gypsy and you think is in design studio
too<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.960> designing<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.409> card

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
too is when you're designing the card

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
too is when you're designing the card
you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.700> exactly<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.180> you're<00:02:00.360> gonna

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you can see exactly what you're gonna

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
you can see exactly what you're gonna
get<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.469> take<00:02:01.680> something<00:02:01.979> from<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
get so you can take something from one

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
get so you can take something from one
cartridge<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.899> an<00:02:04.079> image<00:02:04.380> from

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
cartridge and use it with an image from

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100 
cartridge and use it with an image from
another<00:02:04.829> cartridge<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.540> drag<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.930> over

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
another cartridge you just drag it over

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.330 
another cartridge you just drag it over
on<00:02:07.200> top<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.530> image<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.160> can

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
on top of your image and then you can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.190 
on top of your image and then you can
size<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.450> fit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
size it to fit
