 finally I have this last one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 have been so long before but it is 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.750
 actually do not let any right 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200
 because it is not a real song either 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 but that is this doug and carrie song 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 knowledge determined from king of queens 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 where bacteria recap chance exists 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.410
 just from these two or three 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 sound or make this shitty 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.320
 stupid text here and at the end of the series 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.300
 he stands in this pub and tries 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 carey to recite a proper song 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 but does not get it right and then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.080
 he changes to this song and the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 whole pub goes off and it's easy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.960
 a euro and yes I do that today 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 it is quite easy 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.289
 simple as that us so then let's go 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289
 let it clean 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:30.600
 digitally tuned to normal and we 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.720
 go up here now failed twice 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.370
 and then we go to the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.290
 third bunch on the side 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:47.680
 and then we play the same again 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:49.240
 teacher should yes if it is then once 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.860
 play through it is as if we then 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 always three empty pages are difficult 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.120
 only at the beginning of a 3 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.900
 and then this comes again as this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.210
 this first from the first part and the one with 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.620

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.620
 three and then this comes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 that's the end and now we go 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.840
 then on the five on the side 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.730
 you have to tell a two by four five 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:47.890
 [Music] 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.150
 if we can play it that way now 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.460
 Of course you also have direct text 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:03.809

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.760
 Of course this is difficult in the text 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.140
