00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
we got it and kaboom should give us a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.809 
we got it and kaboom should give us a
perfect<00:03:15.420> explosion<00:03:16.350> no<00:03:16.680> didn't<00:03:17.280> no<00:03:17.459> probably

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
perfect explosion no didn't no probably

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.020 
perfect explosion no didn't no probably
not

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
not

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.569 
not
I<00:03:18.180> guess<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.540> all<00:03:18.600> right<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.400> thought<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.489> would

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
I guess not all right I thought it would

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.890 
I guess not all right I thought it would
give<00:03:20.700> us<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.850> perfect<00:03:21.060> explosion<00:03:21.660> but<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
give us a perfect explosion but a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900 
give us a perfect explosion but a
permanent<00:03:22.109> so<00:03:22.769> we're<00:03:22.889> gonna<00:03:23.069> punch<00:03:23.310> that's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
permanent so we're gonna punch that's

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.819 
permanent so we're gonna punch that's
gonna<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.569> or<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:25.560> make<00:03:25.709> it

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
gonna be like that or we can make it

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.259 
gonna be like that or we can make it
even<00:03:26.010> we<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.370> make<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.609> perfect<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.150> can

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
even we can make it perfect or we can

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
even we can make it perfect or we can
make<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.480> look<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.810> which<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.859> thought<00:03:29.069> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
make it look like that which I thought I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
make it look like that which I thought I
think<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.549> looks<00:03:29.700> cool<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.150> little<00:03:30.780> hole

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
think that looks cool a little hole

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.470 
think that looks cool a little hole
right<00:03:30.959> here<00:03:31.519> no<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.700> right<00:03:32.850> there<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.120> may<00:03:33.420> be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
right here no one right there I may be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.559 
right here no one right there I may be
one<00:03:33.720> right<00:03:33.900> couple<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:34.680> here<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.609> then<00:03:36.209> one

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
one right couple right here and then one

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.710 
one right couple right here and then one
right<00:03:36.750> here<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.109> course<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.239> make

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
right here of course and then I make

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.110 
right here of course and then I make
this<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.049> more<00:03:40.170> natural-looking<00:03:41.120> and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
this a little more natural-looking and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.830

blue<00:05:37.770> team<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:40.070> another<00:05:41.070> colored<00:05:41.490> team<00:05:41.789> we

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
blue team and a another colored team we

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.300 
blue team and a another colored team we
have<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:42.900> decide<00:05:43.289> we'll<00:05:43.530> have<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.740> decide<00:05:44.100> on<00:05:44.250> a

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
have to decide we'll have to decide on a

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.460 
have to decide we'll have to decide on a
cool<00:05:44.520> color<00:05:44.820> for<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.090> red<00:05:45.270> team

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
cool color for the red team

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.770 
cool color for the red team
so<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.400> blue<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.090> brown<00:05:48.270> mushrooms<00:05:48.660> that

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
so the blue and the brown mushrooms that

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.719 
so the blue and the brown mushrooms that
would<00:05:48.900> look<00:05:48.990> pretty<00:05:49.050> cool<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.830> then<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:50.550> can

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
would look pretty cool and then you can

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.180 
would look pretty cool and then you can
get<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:50.970> hell<00:05:51.750> out<00:05:51.900> through<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.169> red<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.740> the

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.830 

I<00:06:19.130> think<00:06:19.520> yellow<00:06:19.699> with<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:19.910> cool<00:06:20.150> yellow<00:06:20.690> is<00:06:20.750> a

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
okay now the same thing and then you

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.650 
okay now the same thing and then you

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
and you could make those holes a little

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.560 
and you could make those holes a little
bit<00:06:45.380> more<00:06:45.590> even<00:06:45.949> it's<00:06:46.850> kind<00:06:47.060> of<00:06:47.180> fair<00:06:47.389> though

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
bit more even it's kind of fair though

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.150 
bit more even it's kind of fair though

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
that for fire but I thought it just

that for fire but I thought it just
looked<00:07:06.560> nice<00:07:06.949> it's<00:07:07.639> like<00:07:07.760> a<00:07:07.940> fire<00:07:08.150> minigame

looked nice it's like a fire minigame
but<00:07:09.260> I<00:07:09.620> thought<00:07:09.800> it<00:07:09.919> looked<00:07:10.010> nice<00:07:10.220> so<00:07:10.400> I<00:07:10.460> tried

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
but I thought it looked nice so I tried

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.860 
but I thought it looked nice so I tried
to<00:07:10.729> do<00:07:10.820> it<00:07:10.880> with<00:07:10.910> a<00:07:11.030> mushroom<00:07:11.210> didn't<00:07:11.690> really

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
to do it with a mushroom didn't really

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.689 
to do it with a mushroom didn't really
work<00:07:12.050> out<00:07:12.169> too<00:07:12.380> much<00:07:12.500> but<00:07:13.190> it<00:07:13.310> makes<00:07:13.460> it<00:07:13.580> look

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
work out too much but it makes it look

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.909 
work out too much but it makes it look
mushroomy<00:07:14.270> so<00:07:14.479> that<00:07:14.599> that's<00:07:14.780> pretty<00:07:15.050> cool<00:07:15.320> but

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
mushroomy so that that's pretty cool but

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.159
