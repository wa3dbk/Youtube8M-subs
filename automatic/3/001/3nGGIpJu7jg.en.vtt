00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.890
 I'm afraid of myself 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.900
 I think it's so good to talk, I think. 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.740
 There's a guy there and it's obvious that we're going 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.229
 die 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 I'm sure that with that, nothing. 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.690
 But okay, I'll make a lot of faces. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.330
 Croatian sun then the next video on the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.030
 the struggle of the two is what is it 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.250
 Then we can get something from you. 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.830

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.040

 come here I'm sure to come 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.760
 someone here because there is always someone 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.610
 over there 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.890
 sometimes a crossbow face and bush looks 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.530
 only the crossbow face you win 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.780
 my heart just should not be the one of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.800
 rigi the next single law when someone 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.200
 play knife 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.250
 but I'm playing because the channel has a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.290
 Machete fado face of weapons not 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.280
 I will kill who this g and what 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:41.780
 explains that it was me who had the head 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:43.790
 It has a team that's it hit the head 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.340
 now this also has a style of my 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.370
 side I just think you can hear everything 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.370
 Good, because I'm happy today, I helped. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.500
 A more expensive relief is that I wanted to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.870
 I know but also because I'll kill you 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.720
 people then I'll kill you 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.310
 my god you are you also instead of 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.290
 Say I do not like you. 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.959
 Obviously we had woman 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.330
 five guys there out of 5 would vote 13 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.290
 totally epic to the extreme without desmatar 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.959
 without knife 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 I seriously stopped with the channel, just not the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.209
 People who do not know are going to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.350
 You do not know about the draw that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.180
 I'll do it on the channel. 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.500
 I suggest you watch the bs 4 video . 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.420
 that I passed 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:39.470
 already in the video description and also a 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.239
 video answer maybe as i speak to 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.820
 respect to the lottery is not the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.870
 Video lottery even use part 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.690
 but in a look just so you know 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.140
 that I will want to draw 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.060
 And that's it, people , let's go and let's go 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.770
 behind him with that knife face screaming 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:03.070
 very strongly in 2012 because it does not come 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.070
 I did not like everything, I'm dead. 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.910
 this face of a knife 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.560
 My heart is chilled, not like that. 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.050
 There is serious reason and I never rest. 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.030
 It looks like a house in the corner, my God. 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.400
 Let's give the affection that also flies that 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.780
 want a tapera that we are very 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.120
 what is this? 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:33.050
 Only it is not, and I think 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:36.560
 beautiful ending right as the bread 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.500
 You are using laithwaites wine jec 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.900
 with the rigors of American trade in 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.120
 boston and barry inpe and personal mail this 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.750
 mine almost there for anyone who wants to test 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.030
 a different kind of knife in my case 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.950
 It's black night this time if you 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.300
 I want you to bring video video of knife I 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.430
 I bring it without problems. 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:01.330
 leave in the comments galera and there are lots of 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.330
 The people that I'm going to give up are gone.
