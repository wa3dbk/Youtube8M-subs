00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
puzzle for me so generally I've never

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
puzzle for me so generally I've never
lost<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.040> cell<00:02:38.220> phone<00:02:38.460> or<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.700> wall<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.090> my<00:02:39.240> entire

lost a cell phone or a wall in my entire

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
lost a cell phone or a wall in my entire
life<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.110> was<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.800> me<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.190> really<00:02:41.460> really

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
life so this was for me a really really

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.960 
life so this was for me a really really
great<00:02:42.270> idea<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.280> bulkier<00:02:44.790> as

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
great idea it is a little bit bulkier as

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.240 
great idea it is a little bit bulkier as
you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.230> mean<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:46.980> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you can see so I mean you know in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150 
you can see so I mean you know in
comparison<00:02:47.730> probably<00:02:48.210> as<00:02:48.300> bulky<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.160> perhaps

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
comparison probably as bulky is perhaps

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.030 
comparison probably as bulky is perhaps
a<00:02:50.520> an<00:02:51.030> otterbox<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:51.990> an<00:02:52.080> HTC<00:02:52.470> One<00:02:52.620> OtterBox

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
