00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it's been something that I've been

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.050 
it's been something that I've been
thinking<00:00:16.949> about<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> last<00:00:17.609> couple<00:00:17.850> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
months and I think it would be will be a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.480 
months and I think it would be will be a
great<00:00:25.279> vehicle<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.670> good<00:00:27.119> starting<00:00:27.630> point<00:00:27.930> to

great vehicle a good starting point to
make<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.060> conversion<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.650> you're

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
make the the conversion because you're

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.690 
make the the conversion because you're
dealing<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> shell<00:00:34.800> it's
