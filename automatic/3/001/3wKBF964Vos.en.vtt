or castle imagine a volleyball but you
left<00:03:06.700> half<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.030> air<00:03:07.390> out<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.080> put

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
left half the air out of it then you put

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:30.680 
left half the air out of it then you put
your<00:03:08.440> fist<00:03:08.740> in<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.100> you've<00:03:09.700> got<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.480 

Bowman's<00:03:31.690> capsule<00:03:32.550> leads<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> twisted<00:03:34.720> -

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
Bowman's capsule leads to a twisted -

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.520 
Bowman's capsule leads to a twisted -
that's<00:03:36.490> near<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.910> Bowman's<00:03:37.570> capsule<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:38.320> so

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
that's near the Bowman's capsule and so

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.790 
that's near the Bowman's capsule and so
they<00:03:38.770> called<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.190> proximal<00:03:39.970> convoluted

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
they called it the proximal convoluted

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.530 
they called it the proximal convoluted
to<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:42.810> proximal<00:03:45.360> proximal<00:03:46.360> convoluted

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
tubules something called Emily's loop it

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
and a sending them the a semi line' then

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.600 
and a sending them the a semi line' then
leads<00:03:57.849> to<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.150> distal<00:03:58.989> convoluted<00:03:59.370> tubules

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
leads to the distal convoluted tubules

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.479 
leads to the distal convoluted tubules
the<00:04:01.360> distal<00:04:01.840> convoluted<00:04:02.050> tubules<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
collecting duct and then eventually the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.699 
collecting duct and then eventually the
collecting<00:04:06.010> duct<00:04:06.190> give<00:04:06.940> these<00:04:07.239> out<00:04:07.569> into<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
collecting duct give these out into the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.390 
collecting duct give these out into the
calyx

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.610 
calyx
typical<00:04:10.390> pyramids<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.780> let's<00:04:13.959> go<00:04:14.110> back<00:04:14.349> here

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
typical pyramids so let's go back here

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.629 
typical pyramids so let's go back here
to<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.519> for<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> second<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:18.370> there's

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
to this just for a second so there's

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.659 
to this just for a second so there's
Bowman's<00:04:19.090> capsule<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:20.200> their<00:04:20.979> treachery<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
Bowman's capsule and their treachery the

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.240 
Bowman's capsule and their treachery the
bonus<00:04:22.030> capsules<00:04:22.540> are<00:04:22.660> located<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.800> cortex

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
bonus capsules are located in the cortex

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.460 
bonus capsules are located in the cortex
and<00:04:24.550> that's<00:04:25.210> why<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.600> cortex<00:04:26.260> appears

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
and that's why the cortex appears

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.800 
and that's why the cortex appears
granular<00:04:27.370> there's<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.700> million<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.389> half<00:04:28.419> of

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
granular there's a million and a half of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.170 
granular there's a million and a half of
these<00:04:28.930> little<00:04:29.139> balls<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.919> are<00:04:30.669> up<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.000> there

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
these little balls that are up in there

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.530 
these little balls that are up in there
so<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.110> end<00:04:32.470> up<00:04:32.530> with<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.940> granular<00:04:33.940> cortex<00:04:34.389> and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
so we end up with a granular cortex and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.350 
so we end up with a granular cortex and
then<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.930> loop<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.770> Henle<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.520> collecting

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
then the loop of Henle and collecting

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.020 
then the loop of Henle and collecting
ducts<00:04:37.600> passed<00:04:38.200> down<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.770> medulla<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.580> so

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
ducts passed down to the medulla and so

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.879 
ducts passed down to the medulla and so
the<00:04:40.210> look<00:04:40.570> appears<00:04:41.229> straight<00:04:43.470> if<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.530> might

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
the look appears straight if you might

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:45.930 
the look appears straight if you might
use

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
use

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.280 
use
Palace<00:04:46.780> looks<00:04:48.690> all<00:04:49.690> right<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.020> here's

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
Palace looks all right so here's

00:04:50.290 --> 00:05:08.930 
Palace looks all right so here's
Bowman's<00:04:50.770> capsule<00:04:53.220> here's<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.780> commode<00:04:55.780> and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:20.090 

turbulence<00:05:09.940> capsule

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.130 

what's<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.340> thing<00:05:21.760> below<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.330> Bowman's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
what's that thing below the Bowman's

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:31.620 
what's that thing below the Bowman's
capsule<00:05:23.880> or<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.150> whole<00:05:25.290> thing<00:05:30.630> so

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
capsule or is the whole thing so

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.480 
capsule or is the whole thing so
Bowman's<00:05:32.020> capsule<00:05:32.230> is<00:05:32.590> kind<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.920> backward<00:05:33.340> to

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
Bowman's capsule is kind of backward to

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.690 
Bowman's capsule is kind of backward to
see<00:05:33.670> shape<00:05:33.940> there<00:05:34.330> yeah<00:05:35.310> in<00:05:36.310> people

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
see shape there yeah in people

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.260 
see shape there yeah in people
volleyball<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.270> half<00:05:37.420> years<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.810> let<00:05:39.270> know

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
volleyball the half years to let know

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.140 
volleyball the half years to let know
you<00:05:41.080> know<00:05:41.320> where<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.890> kidneys<00:05:42.340> filter<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
you know where the kidneys filter the

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.410 
you know where the kidneys filter the
blood<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.410> blood<00:05:44.740> supply<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.760> this<00:05:46.180> is

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
blood and so the blood supply to this is

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.690 
blood and so the blood supply to this is
pretty<00:05:46.840> right<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.650> so<00:05:47.770> we<00:05:47.920> need<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.250> add<00:05:48.400> our

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
pretty right and so we need to add our

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.100 
pretty right and so we need to add our
or<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.570> blood<00:05:49.810> supply<00:05:50.230> in<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:52.120> yeah<00:05:52.630> blood

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
or a blood supply in so yeah blood

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.790 
or a blood supply in so yeah blood
supply<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:54.190> turns<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.760> that<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:56.080> real<00:05:56.320> army

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
supply it turns out that the real army

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.980 
supply it turns out that the real army
comes<00:05:57.070> in<00:05:57.250> it's<00:05:57.550> smaller<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.240> smaller<00:05:58.540> and

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
comes in it's smaller and smaller and

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.720 
comes in it's smaller and smaller and
we're<00:05:59.470> mostly<00:05:59.770> concerned<00:05:59.890> at<00:06:00.550> this<00:06:00.670> point

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
we're mostly concerned at this point

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.530 
we're mostly concerned at this point
