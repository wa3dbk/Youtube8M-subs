00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.050
 the fetuses camp 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 and we come back to the hard facts then 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.369
 to know when you were able to support it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 on the button at the bottom right you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.689
 can make image jumps so 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 it's nice at the top right you 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.030
 have the little square when you click 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 on top of that you actually change the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.970
 indians the format ie that's it 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.310
 there for example I have the sides that are 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.890
 rounded with a slight blur there I 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.520
 full plain images there I have a side 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.920
 come back via a little bit on the side one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.569
 see there a code cd style I would not know 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.040
 not how did you remember that too much 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.510
 case to know that everything at the top right 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.780
 from the ihealth app to c1 is 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.190
 done with a lag of the layers for 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.930
 an effect to give an effect this title 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.980

 well that's good that's still in the race 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.340
 a box I think this is it 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.930
 it's a failure bandage of the band 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.049

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.340
