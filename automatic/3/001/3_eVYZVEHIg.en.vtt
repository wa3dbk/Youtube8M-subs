00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.910 

sort<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.270> gives<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> sort<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> siren<00:01:46.649> kind

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920

of<00:01:47.070> urgent<00:01:47.969> sound<00:01:48.240> okay<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of urgent sound okay so that's how the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.190 
of urgent sound okay so that's how the
look<00:01:49.469> starts<00:01:53.450> okay<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.810> come<00:01:55.049> down

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
look starts okay and then we come down

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.859 
look starts okay and then we come down
here

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.200 

okay<00:02:02.829> so<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:03.520> how<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.850> lick

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
okay so that's that's how that lick

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.730 
okay so that's that's how that lick
basically<00:02:04.810> starts<00:02:05.109> that's<00:02:05.259> how<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.409> fast

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
basically starts that's how the fast

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.369 
basically starts that's how the fast
stuff<00:02:06.009> starts<00:02:06.810> that's<00:02:07.810> probably<00:02:08.110> what<00:02:08.289> you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
stuff starts that's probably what you

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.490 
stuff starts that's probably what you
want<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.649> practice

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.440 

okay<00:02:16.500> because<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.910> key<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
okay because that's that's key that's

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.170 
okay because that's that's key that's
that's<00:02:18.870> um<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> most<00:02:20.190> important

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that's um probably the most important

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:35.009 
that's um probably the most important
part<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> lick<00:02:22.080> going

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.330 

again<00:02:36.019> there's<00:02:36.260> hardly<00:02:36.470> any<00:02:36.680> picking<00:02:37.189> it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
again there's hardly any picking it's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.479 
again there's hardly any picking it's
just<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.730> picked<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> first<00:02:38.269> two<00:02:40.000> first<00:02:41.000> three

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:57.339 

and<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.579> last<00:02:46.790> two<00:02:53.890> okay<00:02:54.939> um<00:02:56.109> yeah<00:02:57.109> that's

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
and the last two okay um yeah that's

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.869 
and the last two okay um yeah that's
what<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> practice<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.189> there<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.579> just

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
what the practice right there and just

what the practice right there and just
just<00:02:59.209> start<00:02:59.569> out<00:02:59.689> slow<00:03:03.400> okay<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.639> just<00:03:04.700> get<00:03:05.120> up

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299

I<00:03:29.510> serve<00:03:30.510> almost<00:03:30.720> do<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.260> want<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.739> that

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.559 

you<00:03:40.739> know<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.640> got<00:03:41.849> bouncing<00:03:42.300> around

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
you know so you just got bouncing around

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.390 
you know so you just got bouncing around
that<00:03:42.720> pentatonic<00:03:43.379> shape<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.220> most

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that pentatonic shape but the most

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.210 
that pentatonic shape but the most
important<00:03:44.849> thing<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.060> how<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.239> starts<00:03:45.780> up<00:03:49.220> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
important thing is how it starts up and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.910 
important thing is how it starts up and
you<00:03:50.730> can<00:03:50.940> use<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.080> that's<00:03:52.470> starting

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
you can use that that that's starting

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.759 
you can use that that that's starting
better<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:57.629> know<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:58.049> throw<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.560> your

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
better you know just throw that in your

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:07.600 
better you know just throw that in your
playing<00:03:58.980> anywhere<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.580> together

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.870 

Oh

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.360 

you<00:04:17.180> know<00:04:17.329> that's<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.109> great<00:04:18.470> way<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.709> start<00:04:19.100> a

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
you know that's a great way to start a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.880 
you know that's a great way to start a
fast<00:04:19.790> lick<00:04:20.150> okay<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.200> little<00:04:21.410> different<00:04:21.769> than

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
fast lick okay a little different than

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.460 
fast lick okay a little different than
the<00:04:21.980> first<00:04:22.010> lick<00:04:22.400> we<00:04:22.550> went<00:04:22.730> over<00:04:23.320> excuse<00:04:24.320> me

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
the first lick we went over excuse me
