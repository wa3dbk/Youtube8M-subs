something<00:04:37.470> something<00:04:38.250> bad<00:04:38.400> happened<00:04:38.880> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
something something bad happened you

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.120 
something something bad happened you
know<00:04:39.900> we<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.140> setback<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.800> rehab

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
know we have a setback in the rehab

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.220 
know we have a setback in the rehab
process<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.390> know<00:04:42.510> we're<00:04:42.810> gonna<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
process and you know we're gonna have to

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.440 
process and you know we're gonna have to
reevaluate<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.310> guess<00:04:44.490> from<00:04:44.700> there<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.330> a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
reevaluate and I guess from there it's a

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.420 
reevaluate and I guess from there it's a
definite<00:04:46.110> surgery<00:04:46.500> because<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.130> not<00:04:47.280> off

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
definite surgery because it's not off

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.980 
definite surgery because it's not off
the<00:04:47.460> table<00:04:47.790> again<00:04:48.210> you're<00:04:48.420> gonna<00:04:48.510> you're

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the table again you're gonna you're

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.560 
the table again you're gonna you're
gonna<00:04:49.080> have<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.380> window<00:04:49.800> here<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.160> how<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.180> know

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570
