 didactic direction not 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.880
 the theme of environmental sustainability and time of day in the debate 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.560
 international politician 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.260
 the European community planned an energy policy aimed at containing the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 consumption to promote renewable energy sources 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.760
 core of the legislation is the building sector responsible for 40% of the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.220
 total consumption 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 Lombardy region in compliance with the European directive has regulated the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.930
 construction sector by setting the standards of quality wood for both 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 new buildings that for those object of restructuring 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.460
 the real estate market stimulated by the measures taken at the regional level 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 and national 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.050
 increasingly directs its choices towards the construction of low-rise buildings 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.880
 energy consumption 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.369
 only through careful planning of the building can it be achieved 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.369
 high energy efficiency 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.080
 first of all it is important to carefully avoid the shape and orientation of the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.070
 buildings 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.170
 the lower the heat loss, the better the performance 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.550
 energy 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.200
 it is important to place the building correctly inside the lot for 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.270
 limit the shading and favor the exploitation of solar radiation 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.840
 the arrangement of the glazed surfaces is more important 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.879
 those to the north and favoring those facing south so as to allow the 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.409
 solar radiation from entering the heated environment 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.279
 in the winter season 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.739
 otherwise in the summer when the position of the sun is high is necessary 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.629
 shade the facades through port 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.099
 the shields so as to avoid overheating of the internal environments 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.589
 to reduce the use of conditioning 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.489
 the use of efficient and fundamental solutions a good insulation of the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.809
 basement filter walls combined with glazed windows and doors 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.849
 high performance limits heat loss to him 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.849
 often heating rooms in summer 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.799
 the greater air tightness of the new windows could cause a 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.810
 increase in the humidity of the rooms that will have to be contrasted through the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.450
 foto the ventilation the renewal and purification of the indoor air are 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.129
 in fact synonymous with health and wellness 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.559
 controlled mechanical ventilation 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:14.049
 it is the best defense against moisture contaminants there a good one 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.809
 design allows a reduction of consumption and installation of a 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.459
 lower power heating system the investment will be 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.249
 offset in a few years the lower costs incurred 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.389
 building operation 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.679
 careful planning helps reduce energy costs and 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.489
 improve environmental comfort for the benefit of those who live there 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.340
 the architectural design of the structure must follow that of the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.269
 thermal plant 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.709
 It is essential to use high heat generation systems 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.250
 efficiency like condensing boilers and heat pumps 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.249
 geothermal that exploit the heat of the earth 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.669
 to reduce consumption to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is necessary 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.389
 designing new buildings intelligently but above all 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.139
 to upgrade existing ones, for example with the replacement of 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.289
 doors and windows blocking the roof 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.849
 the use of plants that use renewable sources is vital 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.309
 importance 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.689
 there are solar thermal collectors that transform solar energy 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.759
 directly in domestic hot water also useful for system integration 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.340
 heating and photovoltaic systems that transform energy 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.249
 solar electricity 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:30.689
 photovoltaics at higher costs than solar collectors but it is 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.009
 stimulated at national level through the energy account 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.419
 to clearly know the energy quality of a building or 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.240
 contact an accredited certified training technician 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.710
 the certifier through a careful analysis of the hm processing building 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.490
 of the collected data will evaluate its energy performance summarizing the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.379
 my certificate of energy certification or face 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.990
 the company is essential to know the energy class 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:03.129
 of the building the staircase goes from the 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.400
 happy hour at g like that assigned to household appliances 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.639
 lacie is an effective tool in choosing a kennel property 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.330
 identification of interventions aimed at improving energy efficiency 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.039
 moreover it allows the direct comparison between similar properties allows you to 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.029
 evaluate differences in energy consumption 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.109
 Lombardy was one of the first regions to establish its own system 

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:30.129
 of energy certification of buildings 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.349
 the Lombard certification system called Fog is managed by 17 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.110
 spa lombardia region company I accreditation body on the subject 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.909
 of energy certification of buildings 7 drawers to those who manage the 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.249
 The energy register that collects the energy certifications is offered 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.979
 information to citizens 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.979
 and to all professionals involved 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.929
 for any information we invite you to consult the site there is nothing. it 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.539
 the future is in our hands
