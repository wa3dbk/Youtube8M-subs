off<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:56.079> my<00:02:56.380> rhythm<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> little<00:02:56.860> bit<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.630> you

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
off of my rhythm a little bit so you

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.710 
off of my rhythm a little bit so you
know<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.680> said<00:03:00.100> myself<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.329> I<00:03:01.360> really

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.030 
know I just said myself to that I really
need<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.019> hang<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.410> there<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:04.180> give<00:03:04.480> in
