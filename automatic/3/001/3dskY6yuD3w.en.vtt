00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
really running let's give it another go

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.650 
really running let's give it another go
here<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:08.100> love<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.220> wine<00:02:09.459> too<00:02:09.940> that's

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
here we just I love the wine too that's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.790 
here we just I love the wine too that's
great<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.890> smooth<00:02:12.430> effortless<00:02:13.800> that's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
great just smooth effortless that's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.449 
great just smooth effortless that's
that's<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.700> impressive<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.840> see<00:02:17.080> why

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
that's really impressive I can see why

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.430 
that's really impressive I can see why
why<00:02:18.459> electric<00:02:19.120> drive<00:02:19.420> may<00:02:19.780> have<00:02:20.019> huge

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
why electric drive may have huge

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.949 
why electric drive may have huge
advantages<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:22.150> people<00:02:22.510> who<00:02:22.630> really

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
advantages for for people who really

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.449 
advantages for for people who really
like<00:02:23.170> performance<00:02:23.650> driving<00:02:23.890> that's<00:02:24.190> that's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
like performance driving that's that's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.420 
like performance driving that's that's
very<00:02:24.700> impressive<00:02:28.440> we've<00:02:29.440> replaced<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
very impressive we've replaced the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.759 
very impressive we've replaced the
traditional<00:02:30.940> gear<00:02:31.660> shifter<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.680> a

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
traditional gear shifter with just a

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.530 
traditional gear shifter with just a
push<00:02:32.920> button<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> single<00:02:34.269> speed

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
push button we have a single speed

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.050 
push button we have a single speed
reduction<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.709> unlike<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.610> lot<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.880> vehicles

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
reduction so unlike a lot of vehicles

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.759 
reduction so unlike a lot of vehicles
which<00:02:37.450> are<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.049> multiple<00:02:38.500> speed

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
which are now going to multiple speed

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.220 
which are now going to multiple speed
six<00:02:39.100> seven<00:02:39.400> eight<00:02:39.489> speeds<00:02:39.850> or<00:02:40.230> complex

six seven eight speeds or complex

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.199 
six seven eight speeds or complex
transmissions<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.340> really<00:02:42.579> can<00:02:42.730> do<00:02:42.940> all<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
transmissions we really can do all of

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.060 
transmissions we really can do all of
the<00:02:43.420> performance<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.110> top<00:02:44.260> speed<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the performance and top speed with a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.890 
the performance and top speed with a
single<00:02:45.489> gear<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.910> would<00:02:46.030> usually<00:02:46.420> expect<00:02:46.810> there

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
single gear I would usually expect there

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.630 
single gear I would usually expect there
to<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.019> an<00:02:47.110> engine<00:02:47.440> back<00:02:47.620> here<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.250> there<00:02:48.489> is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
to be an engine back here but there is

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
to be an engine back here but there is
not<00:02:48.910> an<00:02:49.120> engine<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:49.480> what's<00:02:49.959> under<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> hood

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
not an engine so what's under the hood

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.520 
not an engine so what's under the hood
and<00:02:51.070> boot<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> hood<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.959> vehicle<00:02:53.140> is

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and boot so the hood on this vehicle is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.930 
and boot so the hood on this vehicle is
in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.370> back<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.329> vehicle<00:02:56.730> carbon<00:02:57.730> fiber

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
haha danger high voltage what happens if

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.390 
haha danger high voltage what happens if
i<00:03:01.420> touch<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.410> touch<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.620> okay<00:03:03.130> no

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
i touch this you can touch it okay no

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.490 
i touch this you can touch it okay no
problem<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.269> put<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.840> there<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.110> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
problem we just put it on there is a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.850 
problem we just put it on there is a
safety<00:03:05.890> precaution<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.489> others<00:03:07.380> yeah<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.709> we

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
safety precaution for others yeah so we

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.100 
safety precaution for others yeah so we
we<00:03:09.100> house<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.489> electric<00:03:09.850> motor<00:03:10.000> 190<00:03:10.690> kill

to<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.710> family<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.220> motors<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> family

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
to have a family of motors and a family

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.400 
to have a family of motors and a family
of<00:03:48.240> batteries<00:03:48.660> which<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:48.990> can<00:03:49.140> use<00:03:49.260> in

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
of batteries which we can use in

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.840 
of batteries which we can use in
multiple<00:03:49.740> applications<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.490> we<00:03:50.700> can

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
multiple applications so that we can

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.180 
multiple applications so that we can
bring<00:03:50.940> up<00:03:51.120> volume<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.410> Chrysler<00:03:52.980> and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
bring up volume now on the Chrysler and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.920 
bring up volume now on the Chrysler and
the<00:03:53.250> Jeep<00:03:53.640> we'll<00:03:53.790> talk<00:03:53.940> about<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.210> minute<00:03:54.540> these

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the Jeep we'll talk about a minute these

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.380 
the Jeep we'll talk about a minute these
are<00:03:55.110> range-extended<00:03:55.740> electric<00:03:55.770> cars<00:03:56.390> for

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
are range-extended electric cars for

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.360 
are range-extended electric cars for
seventy-five<00:03:57.990> percent<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.440> Americans<00:03:58.980> they

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
seventy-five percent of Americans they

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.520 
seventy-five percent of Americans they
drive<00:03:59.610> less<00:03:59.820> than<00:03:59.970> 40<00:04:00.240> miles<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.630> day<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.290> that's

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
drive less than 40 miles a day so that's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.260 
drive less than 40 miles a day so that's
why<00:04:01.770> we<00:04:01.800> take<00:04:02.130> 40<00:04:02.460> miles<00:04:02.640> for<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> battery

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
why we take 40 miles for the battery

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.600 
why we take 40 miles for the battery
pack<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:05.010> travel<00:04:05.340> more

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
pack and if but if you do travel more

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.400 
pack and if but if you do travel more
than<00:04:05.760> 40<00:04:06.000> miles<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.330> day<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.020> we<00:04:07.140> want<00:04:07.260> you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
than 40 miles a day you know we want you

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.230 
than 40 miles a day you know we want you
to<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.560> able<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.920> continue<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.430> commute<00:04:08.850> so

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
to be able to continue that commute so

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.460 
to be able to continue that commute so
all<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.570> need<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.080> create<00:04:10.260> additional

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
all we need to do is create additional

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.140 
all we need to do is create additional
electricity<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.220> drive<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.580> wheels<00:04:11.700> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
electricity to drive the wheels and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.180 
electricity to drive the wheels and
that's<00:04:12.300> what<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> purpose<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.470> range

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that's what the purpose is of the range

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.409 
that's what the purpose is of the range
extender<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.890> for<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.160> g<00:04:17.310> fo<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.730> take<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
extender so for the g fo we take the

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.270 
extender so for the g fo we take the
same<00:04:18.600> electric<00:04:18.989> motor<00:04:19.200> again<00:04:19.560> now<00:04:19.919> we<00:04:19.980> drive

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
same electric motor again now we drive

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.440 
same electric motor again now we drive
the<00:04:20.430> rear<00:04:20.609> wheels<00:04:20.850> instead<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.299> front

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
the rear wheels instead of the front

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.990 
the rear wheels instead of the front
wheel<00:04:21.690> our<00:04:21.959> idea<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:23.220> offer<00:04:23.400> two<00:04:23.850> wheel

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
wheel our idea is to offer two wheel

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.430 
wheel our idea is to offer two wheel
drive<00:04:24.030> version<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> one<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:24.960> have<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.140> today

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
drive version the one we have here today

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.560 
drive version the one we have here today
but<00:04:25.980> they're<00:04:26.160> also<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.520> do<00:04:26.730> in<00:04:26.970> wheel<00:04:27.180> motors

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
but they're also to do in wheel motors

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.330 
but they're also to do in wheel motors
to<00:04:27.780> each<00:04:27.960> one<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.350> wheels<00:04:28.530> which<00:04:28.980> provides

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
to each one of the wheels which provides

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.940 
to each one of the wheels which provides
true<00:04:29.790> four-wheel<00:04:30.120> drive<00:04:30.530> capability<00:04:31.530> if<00:04:31.860> you

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
true four-wheel drive capability if you

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.290 
true four-wheel drive capability if you
have<00:04:32.070> n<00:04:32.220> wheel<00:04:32.370> motors<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.940> potentially

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
have n wheel motors you can potentially

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.840 
have n wheel motors you can potentially
apply<00:04:33.750> power<00:04:34.350> two<00:04:34.680> wheels<00:04:34.950> individually<00:04:35.640> that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
apply power two wheels individually that

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
apply power two wheels individually that
might<00:04:35.970> work<00:04:36.090> as<00:04:36.270> an<00:04:36.360> excellent<00:04:36.660> traction

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
might work as an excellent traction

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.960 
might work as an excellent traction
control<00:04:37.169> system<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.860> exactly<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.490> benefits

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
control system it's exactly the benefits

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.719 
control system it's exactly the benefits
you<00:04:39.090> can<00:04:39.570> control<00:04:39.840> each<00:04:40.080> will<00:04:40.380> precisely<00:04:41.070> sort

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
you can control each will precisely sort

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.150 
you can control each will precisely sort
off<00:04:42.000> road<00:04:42.330> going<00:04:43.080> over<00:04:43.229> rocks<00:04:43.590> going<00:04:44.010> through

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
off road going over rocks going through

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.490 
off road going over rocks going through
streams<00:04:44.550> but<00:04:45.000> even<00:04:45.120> on<00:04:45.479> road<00:04:45.690> performance<00:04:46.320> so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
streams but even on road performance so

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040 
streams but even on road performance so
each<00:04:46.890> wheel<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.400> braked<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.330> accelerated

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
each wheel can be braked and accelerated

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.190 
each wheel can be braked and accelerated
separately<00:04:49.500> we<00:04:49.890> can<00:04:50.070> control<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.960> up<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.169> a

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
separately we can control the up to a

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.530 
separately we can control the up to a
half<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.950> degree<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.520> precision<00:04:53.729> for<00:04:54.270> each<00:04:54.390> one

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
half a degree of precision for each one

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.000 
half a degree of precision for each one
of<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.660> wheels<00:04:54.810> through<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.410> pretty<00:04:55.710> couple

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
of the wheels through to a pretty couple

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.180 
of the wheels through to a pretty couple
exit<00:04:56.340> control<00:04:56.460> mechanism

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
exit control mechanism

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.499 
exit control mechanism
so<00:04:59.190> these<00:04:59.310> are<00:04:59.370> in<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.550> concept<00:04:59.940> stage<00:05:00.180> I

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
so these are in the concept stage I

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.870 
so these are in the concept stage I
guess<00:05:01.229> everybody<00:05:01.500> has<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.650> ask<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.069> but<00:05:02.130> does

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
guess everybody has to ask this but does

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.820 
guess everybody has to ask this but does
this<00:05:03.030> point<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.750> way<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.110> future<00:05:04.470> what

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
this point the way to the future what

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.499 
this point the way to the future what
are<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:04.979> odds<00:05:05.069> of<00:05:05.280> these<00:05:05.460> kind<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:06.030> vehicles

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
are the odds of these kind of vehicles

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.029 
are the odds of these kind of vehicles
making<00:05:06.690> their<00:05:06.930> way<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.050> people's<00:05:07.770> actual

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
making their way to people's actual

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.920 
making their way to people's actual
driveways<00:05:08.580> yeah<00:05:08.849> we<00:05:08.970> announced<00:05:09.330> last<00:05:09.750> month

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
driveways yeah we announced last month

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.510 
driveways yeah we announced last month
that<00:05:10.139> one<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> three<00:05:10.800> vehicles<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.340> see

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
that one of the three vehicles you see

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.070 
that one of the three vehicles you see
here<00:05:11.699> today<00:05:11.970> will<00:05:12.389> be<00:05:12.509> in<00:05:12.599> production<00:05:12.780> in

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
here today will be in production in

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.710 
here today will be in production in
2008's<00:05:13.830> are<00:05:14.580> weakened<00:05:14.849> are<00:05:14.940> we<00:05:15.030> guessing<00:05:15.300> do<00:05:15.660> i

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
2008's are weakened are we guessing do i

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.570 
2008's are weakened are we guessing do i
do<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.110> get<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.590> get<00:05:16.770> me<00:05:16.830> saying<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.220> you

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
do I get you a get me saying that you
