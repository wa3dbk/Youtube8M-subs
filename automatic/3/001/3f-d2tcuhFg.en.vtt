nice<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.780> papers<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:22.890> pretty<00:03:23.130> much

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
nice and the papers are pretty much

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.699 
nice and the papers are pretty much
split<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.410> deal<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.730> various<00:03:27.180> matches

split up to deal with various matches

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.520 
split up to deal with various matches
these<00:03:28.709> are<00:03:29.300> like<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.600> proactive<00:03:31.170> Hebert's

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
these are like the proactive Hebert's

these are like the proactive Hebert's
and<00:03:31.980> these<00:03:32.130> are<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.640> reactive

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
and these are the reactive

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.050 
and these are the reactive
I<00:03:33.780> guess<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.830> match<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.430> moon<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:36.000> of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
I guess the match the moon is kind of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.750 
I guess the match the moon is kind of
proactive<00:03:36.270> since<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:38.250> play<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:38.670> then

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
proactive since you play it and then

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.470 
proactive since you play it and then
they<00:03:38.880> can't<00:03:39.090> cast<00:03:39.240> anything<00:03:39.630> but<00:03:40.260> idle<00:03:41.160> on

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
they can't cast anything but idle on

ages<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.720> gatok<00:03:43.050> tea<00:03:43.200> are<00:03:43.590> there<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:45.000> make<00:03:45.780> it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
ages and gatok tea are there to make it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.900 
ages and gatok tea are there to make it
harder<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.230> cast<00:03:46.530> spells<00:03:46.890> impossible<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.730> cast

some spells or add a real cost to
casting<00:03:51.600> spells<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.170> with<00:03:53.510> storm<00:03:54.510> decks<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
casting spells like with storm decks and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.810 
casting spells like with storm decks and
I<00:03:57.060> haven't<00:03:57.959> had<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.560> chance<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:59.160> test<00:03:59.670> this

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
I haven't had a chance to test this

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.010 
I haven't had a chance to test this
against<00:04:00.150> storm<00:04:00.890> but<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.300> these<00:04:03.780> two

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
against storm but like this these two

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.310 
against storm but like this these two
little<00:04:04.520> enchantment<00:04:05.520> creatures<00:04:06.390> seem<00:04:07.080> like

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
little enchantment creatures seem like

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.170 
little enchantment creatures seem like
they<00:04:07.740> give<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.040> deck<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> lot<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.700> booths<00:04:08.910> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
they give the deck a lot of booths that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.979 
they give the deck a lot of booths that
it<00:04:09.390> didn't<00:04:09.630> have<00:04:11.480> basically<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.570> couple<00:04:12.750> months

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
it didn't have basically a couple months

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:21.830 
it didn't have basically a couple months
ago<00:04:13.880> then<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.859> get<00:04:17.120> scavenging<00:04:18.120> use<00:04:20.810> well<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
ago then you get scavenging use well I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.690 
ago then you get scavenging use well I
guess<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.440> magic<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.100> also<00:04:23.430> decent

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
guess that the magic is also decent

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.450 
guess that the magic is also decent
against<00:04:24.630> storm<00:04:25.290> but<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.919> get<00:04:26.070> scavenging

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
