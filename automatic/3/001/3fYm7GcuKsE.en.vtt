00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.320 

this<00:00:01.560> computer<00:00:01.920> needs<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.399> little<00:00:02.550> boost<00:00:02.820> and

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
this computer needs a little boost and

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.440 
this computer needs a little boost and
one<00:00:03.720> way<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> do<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.859> add<00:00:05.520> some<00:00:06.270> more

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
one way to do that is to add some more

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.910 
one way to do that is to add some more
random<00:00:07.200> access<00:00:07.589> memory<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.700> Ram<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.480> short<00:00:09.920> so

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
random access memory or Ram for short so

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.610 
random access memory or Ram for short so
we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> go<00:00:11.670> ahead<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.240> now

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
we're going to go ahead and do that now

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.200 
we're going to go ahead and do that now
one<00:00:13.620> thing<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.889> might<00:00:14.099> point<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.549> always

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
one thing I might point out always

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.140 
one thing I might point out always
unplug<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.020> power<00:00:16.410> cord<00:00:18.439> that<00:00:19.439> could<00:00:19.740> be

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
unplug the power cord that could be

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.400 
unplug the power cord that could be
caused<00:00:21.150> problems<00:00:22.400> touch<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.609> case<00:00:24.410> static

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
caused problems touch the case static

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
caused problems touch the case static
electricity<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.250> real<00:00:26.580> bad<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:26.960> electronics

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
electricity is real bad on electronics

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250 
electricity is real bad on electronics
so<00:00:28.760> anyway<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:30.269> go<00:00:30.420> ahead<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.720> open<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so anyway let's go ahead and open this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.850 
so anyway let's go ahead and open this
thing<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> notice<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.230> taking<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
thing up and you notice I'm taking the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.990 
thing up and you notice I'm taking the
side<00:00:35.130> loose<00:00:36.170> that's<00:00:37.170> opposite<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
side loose that's opposite from the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
side loose that's opposite from the
connectors<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:41.809> would<00:00:42.809> give<00:00:43.020> us<00:00:43.050> access<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
connectors that would give us access to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.860 
connectors that would give us access to
the<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> motherboard<00:00:50.239> okay

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.520 

now<00:00:56.989> as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.399> looking<00:00:59.399> inside<00:00:59.969> here

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
now as you can see looking inside here

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.609 
now as you can see looking inside here
we've<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:02.059> two<00:01:03.059> different<00:01:03.510> kinds<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.379> RAM

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
we've got two different kinds of RAM

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
we've got two different kinds of RAM
slots<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.700> one's<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.210> different

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
slots here this one's a little different

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.910 
slots here this one's a little different
size<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:07.950> colored

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
size then it's got different colored

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
size then it's got different colored
locks<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.340> these<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.940> ddr<00:01:15.479> slots

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
locks on there so these are ddr slots

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.830 
locks on there so these are ddr slots
and<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:18.090> sdram<00:01:18.960> slots<00:01:19.670> now<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.840> highly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and these are sdram slots now I highly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.760 
and these are sdram slots now I highly
recommend<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.270> mix<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.560> other

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
recommend do not mix the two in other

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.999 
recommend do not mix the two in other
words<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.399> put<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.119> 2d<00:01:27.570> dr's<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> SD

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
words don't put in 2d dr's and to SD

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.779 
words don't put in 2d dr's and to SD
rams<00:01:30.830> mainly<00:01:31.830> because<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.399> run<00:01:32.610> off<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
rams mainly because they run off a

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.490 
rams mainly because they run off a
different<00:01:33.119> voltages<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.350> your

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
different voltages now if your

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130 
different voltages now if your
motherboard<00:01:35.190> book<00:01:35.460> tells<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.149> it's<00:01:36.720> okay

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
motherboard book tells you it's okay

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.980 
motherboard book tells you it's okay
then<00:01:37.440> then<00:01:37.830> go<00:01:38.070> ahead<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.810> right

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
then then go ahead but this one right

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.499 
then then go ahead but this one right
highly<00:01:40.409> recommends<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.220> doing<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:42.330> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
highly recommends not doing that or you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.370 
highly recommends not doing that or you
can<00:01:42.690> have<00:01:42.869> problems<00:01:43.110> mess<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.580> you're

notice on this motherboard is the model

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.309 
notice on this motherboard is the model
number<00:01:55.069> which<00:01:56.069> allowed<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
number which allowed me to go into the

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.930 
number which allowed me to go into the
website<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.750> ran<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.959> number<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:01.940> the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
website I I ran that number on the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.440 
website I I ran that number on the
search<00:02:03.149> engine<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.399> found<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.640> manufacturer

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
search engine and found the manufacturer

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
search engine and found the manufacturer
of<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> board<00:02:07.200> which<00:02:07.410> is<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> biostar<00:02:08.280> and

of the board which is a biostar and
found<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.709> exactly<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.150> thing<00:02:12.560> would

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
found out exactly what this thing would

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.040 
found out exactly what this thing would
take<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.989> right<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.020> I've<00:02:16.560> only<00:02:16.770> got<00:02:17.030> 256<00:02:18.050> megs
