00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bring in my seismic I forgot this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.649 
bring in my seismic I forgot this
thing's<00:01:55.470> name<00:01:55.680> seismitoad<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.060> he

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
thing's name seismitoad and he

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
thing's name seismitoad and he
unfortunately<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> missing<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
unfortunately it's a missing the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.520 
unfortunately it's a missing the
hurricane<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> mean<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.119> 70<00:02:01.079> accuracy

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
hurricane but I mean it is 70 accuracy

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.550 
hurricane but I mean it is 70 accuracy
so<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.799> does<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> solid<00:02:02.520> chance<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.030> miss

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so it does have a solid chance to miss

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.569 
so it does have a solid chance to miss
unfortunately<00:02:04.560> though<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.369> lucky

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
unfortunately though I get really lucky

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.449 
unfortunately though I get really lucky
next<00:02:06.329> turn<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.570> exe<00:02:07.200> misses<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> second

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
next turn and exe misses the second

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
Scott unfortunately this seismitoad does

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.990 
Scott unfortunately this seismitoad does
not<00:03:16.470> carry<00:03:16.680> toxic<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.700> did<00:03:17.880> have

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
not carry toxic on and if I did have

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360 
not carry toxic on and if I did have
toxic<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.630> would<00:03:19.200> have<00:03:19.320> most<00:03:19.440> likely<00:03:19.590> gone<00:03:20.070> for

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
toxic I would have most likely gone for

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.340 
toxic I would have most likely gone for
this<00:03:20.730> turn<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.240> as<00:03:21.870> you're<00:03:22.020> about<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.230> see

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
this turn but as you're about to see

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.660 
this turn but as you're about to see
it's<00:03:22.530> kind<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.740> good<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.550> have

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
it's kind of good that I don't have

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.460 
it's kind of good that I don't have
toxic<00:03:24.360> because<00:03:24.480> Richard<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.110> actually<00:03:25.350> going

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
toxic because Richard is actually going

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.860 
toxic because Richard is actually going
to<00:03:25.560> switch<00:03:25.710> into<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.730> Amongus<00:03:27.090> predicting<00:03:27.750> me

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
to switch into the Amongus predicting me

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.870 
to switch into the Amongus predicting me
to<00:03:28.050> bring<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.290> my<00:03:28.410> shame<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.370> i<00:03:29.400> did<00:03:29.730> get

getting off a crate earth power which

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
getting off a crate earth power which
