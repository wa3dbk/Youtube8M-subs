00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
like a twist up say all shade selection

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.809 
like a twist up say all shade selection
before<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.340> nice<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.730> really

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
before I was really nice and really

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.339 
before I was really nice and really
appropriate<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.450> kind<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.720> spring<00:02:31.049> sunlight

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
appropriate for kind of spring sunlight

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.720 
appropriate for kind of spring sunlight
and<00:02:31.590> I'll<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.769> interesting<00:02:32.159> to<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.610> kind

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
and I'll be interesting to see what kind

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
and I'll be interesting to see what kind
of<00:02:32.879> types<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.420> shades<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:33.989> bring<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.349> during

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
of types of shades they bring out during

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.740 
of types of shades they bring out during
the<00:02:34.950> winter<00:02:35.190> months<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.910> well<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.690> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the winter months as well so kind of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.070 
the winter months as well so kind of
slightly<00:02:36.959> deeper<00:02:37.260> shades<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:39.080> main

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
slightly deeper shades and the main

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.479 
slightly deeper shades and the main
thing<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.500> think<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:40.799> these<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.280> they

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
thing I think about these is that they

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.280 
thing I think about these is that they
don't<00:02:41.760> feel<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:43.430> drugstore<00:02:44.430> brand<00:02:45.329> but<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
don't feel like a drugstore brand but I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.319 
don't feel like a drugstore brand but I
feel<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.069> Revlon<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> higher-end

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
feel like Revlon is a higher-end

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.210 
feel like Revlon is a higher-end
drugstore<00:02:48.780> brand<00:02:48.989> anyway<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> therefore<00:02:50.069> as

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
drugstore brand anyway and therefore as

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.890 
drugstore brand anyway and therefore as
we've<00:02:50.400> got<00:02:50.579> higher<00:02:50.790> expectations<00:02:51.599> when<00:02:51.810> I'm

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
we've got higher expectations when I'm

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
we've got higher expectations when I'm
using<00:02:52.019> something<00:02:52.379> from<00:02:52.650> Revlon<00:02:53.010> versus<00:02:53.459> using

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
using something from Revlon versus using

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.000 
using something from Revlon versus using
something<00:02:54.000> from<00:02:54.120> my<00:02:54.390> collection<00:02:55.019> because<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
something from my collection because I

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.440 
something from my collection because I
feel<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:56.489> are<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.700> higher-end

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
feel like they are a higher-end

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.809 
feel like they are a higher-end
brand<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.170> they<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:59.099> got<00:02:59.280> kind<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.549> higher

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
brand and they have got kind of higher

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.400 
brand and they have got kind of higher
quality<00:03:00.060> product<00:03:00.660> that's<00:03:00.840> why<00:03:01.049> they're<00:03:01.260> kind

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
quality product that's why they're kind

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.759 
quality product that's why they're kind
of<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.799> more<00:03:01.829> expensive<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.700> well<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
of a little bit more expensive as well I

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.099 
of a little bit more expensive as well I
really<00:03:04.769> really<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.190> these<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.930> I've

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
really really like these I think I've

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.140 
really really like these I think I've
got<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.349> kind<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.590> shades<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.160> want<00:03:08.489> here

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
got the kind of shades that I want here

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.349 
got the kind of shades that I want here
but<00:03:09.870> possibly<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.579> would<00:03:11.970> pick<00:03:12.180> up

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
but possibly that I would pick up

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.150 
but possibly that I would pick up
another<00:03:12.660> couple<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.049> shades<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:14.099> do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
another couple of shades I think they do

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.099 
another couple of shades I think they do
kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> deeper<00:03:15.480> red<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.930> I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
kind of like a deeper red one that I

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.720 
kind of like a deeper red one that I
might<00:03:16.260> pick<00:03:16.470> up<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.769> well<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.129> I've<00:03:17.280> got<00:03:17.459> five

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
might pick up as well but I've got five

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.400 
might pick up as well but I've got five
here<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.690> really<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.349> I'm

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
here that I really really like and I'm

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.589 
here that I really really like and I'm
really<00:03:19.620> appropriate<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.730> only<00:03:21.090> thing<00:03:21.329> is

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
really appropriate the only thing is

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.180 
really appropriate the only thing is
like<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.959> said<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.230> have<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.739> scrub

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
like I said you have to really scrub

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.500 
like I said you have to really scrub
your<00:03:23.340> lips<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.730> make<00:03:23.849> sure<00:03:23.970> they're<00:03:24.180> super

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
your lips and make sure they're super

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.330 
your lips and make sure they're super
moisturized<00:03:25.049> before<00:03:25.290> applying<00:03:25.590> them<00:03:25.829> because

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
moisturized before applying them because

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.759 
moisturized before applying them because
they<00:03:26.489> can<00:03:26.870> dry<00:03:27.870> your<00:03:27.989> lips<00:03:28.139> out<00:03:28.349> because<00:03:28.650> their

they can dry your lips out because their

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.170
