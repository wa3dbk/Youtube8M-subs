 main metal-mechanical pole of the state and 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.429
 the second of the country and it is from here that this 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.049
 vehicle used by the army and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.630
 UN peacekeeping missions 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.900
 some examples of the legacy built on 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.560
 140 years of history 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.560
 Bet you made this land your home 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 the homage to Italians and descendants 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.680
 today because 140 years ago the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.079
 circumstances have made them here 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.450
 but that or other dates 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.390
 also happened with German Portuguese 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.789
 is the territory of the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 Rio Grande do Sul becomes even more special with 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.170
 this mixture of people of customs this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 cultural diversity 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.129
 the multiplicity of food flavors without 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.690
 see the accent 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 that's all that it deserves to be 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 valued and preserved then today. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.909
 Our homage is to the Italians. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.950
 We should take yes, we'll see each other tomorrow. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.189
 Today we finished with images of the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.280
 monument to the immigrant in southern caxias 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.280
