 and I the witch 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.880
 and I told him to come 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.119
 how big

 those of columbus on the server an unknown 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 then I license Celtic the expert 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.580
 i are the same 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.310
 that did not resist 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.800
 they are the same as they say they saw is the captain who hear 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.080
 piqué abidal mascherano 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.150
 I want is a player 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.100
 What I have is a transplant 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.220
 I usually do not want to be a captain. 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.650
 nothing that always 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 the three points of advantage after which the questioning of journalists 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.910
 more or less where we went 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.940
 they asked for prudence meaning that in questioning the agent in question 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 tower to the legitimate over 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649
 as legitimate players like 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.939
 to ensure that the Cuban song that escaped looks at us as a hundred 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.939
 public servants yours the selector 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 bo selected 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.350
 and it has four days 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 above a formula 1 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.770
 to put them on the court 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.030
 and do not forget we're on the other side of the world 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.490
 rodeos 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.940
 a day and a half 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 placid to recover it 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.870
 then you have to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.390
 you have to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.170
 do 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.210
 the evaluation 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.810
 with the doctors with the proposes 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 and then fourth and after football pressure 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.990
 if I want you to the esteemed the coach who comes 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.080
 what do you control palate 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.179
 they are a lot of things that influence 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.779
 activists of you 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.629
 let's have counter time 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.470
 penal penalty the counted minutes did it with diego costa the study contributes until 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.549
 the particular moment and asked the world at the time 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.649
 at the moment I 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.579
 Look, they told me that I had some 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.509
 I was not going to get it because it was in 2000 the boyfriend joel 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.539
 because the unicaja 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.019
 and yet the people of all air and in it they talk about realizing the 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.199
 Albarreal livestock has correlate of what is going to pay for the afternoon 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.749
 and the town are the bank in the last game 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.119
 because the predictable 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.889
 to the 'apache' tevez 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.079
 already palermo belgrano an annual yield or 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.079
 in the match against Peru 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.899
 but pole assisting in agreement according to what worked cooperating 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.320
 I trusted 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.109
 I heard there 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 that tactic was born to my side 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:12.139
 I swore to Pal since he died at the same level 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.419
 what bilardo 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.739
 he never suggested 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.679
 to me 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.959
 personally 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.719
 a player and a change 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.389
 and bilardo is never 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.389
 when I from the team formation 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.949
 allende 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.459
 ya mancuso 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.499
 we are the only three that 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.499
 what we talk about but the team put it together 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.029
 as well as I lost all three matches 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.129
 inveravante 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.769
 the match with Uruguay the tactics the definitive 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.779
 Amy Bilardo did not suggest anything 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.119
 and if he suggested it to lemme 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.399
 It's another problem 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.139
 she will have to speak it 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.149
 because there was talk 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.919
 percent at that time 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.919
 of what couple from here on the line of four 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.289
 and the couple is not what I need for the fund 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.339
 m / b background 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.299
 I was clear that I was going to enter volatile 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.650
 iván ramón socias and memoria di maría 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.650
 and the apache has the have up to hold 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.050
 they say that bilardo will be weaker in the chain 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 no hand of bilardo for more than him 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.909
 there is also sea there is orange tide dv 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.779
 when i arrived in valencia 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.759
 there is a reference 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.289
 said pablo romano elena espinosa human being walks 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.159
 the 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.110
 Russia 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.520
 h event for niger and they have clear for griñán claro 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.939
 in the time 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.189
 the team 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.069
 how they told t before it 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.659
 I had problems with di maría 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.080
 by morena and maría 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.580
 or problems that after 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.639
 they tell me 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.169
 because they wanted 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.460
 that put in auction 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.840
 I'm the puche time good idea but it does not have a good voice so we said 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.340
 then that if it is fair or they did not want no not percent that in the debt 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.020
 internal 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.990
 20 years old 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.099
 the internal foot fill 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.360
 percent is a light and bilardo mancuso pride 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.069
 so 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.260
 percent 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.990
 he suggested manco 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.089
 to talk to me and I never speak 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.349
 a stick 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.740
 a colossus 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.900
 I do not know what I'm going to eat there I killed nobody but they do not throw a cat 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:46.389
 Unlike 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.680
 all 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.539
 I think 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.539
 efe percent the manager phase 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.779
 and what makes the typical pastry 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.150
 of tactics 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.069
 it's because bilardo 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.069
 the technician exceeds the manual 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.159
 the malayo shiver with grondona up 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.479
 of sack and tie 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.900
 and what we all have to break our heads 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.779
 thinking about the changes 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.979
 We are about 3 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.169
 that's why I tell you that the changes 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.309
 and the tactic 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:19.550
 From Uruguay 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.330
 we put it together 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.969
 to make it clear 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.069
 very good to 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:27.860
 to a referee who led the study
