00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
where you can catch your enemy off guard

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.010

I'll<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.330> able<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.570> demonstrate<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.380> this

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
game hopefully I won't have to be in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
game hopefully I won't have to be in
that<00:02:33.060> position<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> think<00:02:34.860> that's<00:02:35.010> one

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that position but I think that's one

confused does he have a base like top

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.580 
confused does he have a base like top
right<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.479> he<00:04:17.690> was<00:04:17.810> just<00:04:18.019> going<00:04:18.260> down<00:04:18.410> there

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
right and he was just going down there

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.490 
right and he was just going down there
to<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.160> fast<00:04:19.400> expansion<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.229> might

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
to do a fast expansion if so I might

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.870 
to do a fast expansion if so I might
have<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.680> change<00:04:21.950> my<00:04:22.010> build<00:04:22.310> order<00:04:22.550> up<00:04:22.669> here

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
have to change my build order up here

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.530 
have to change my build order up here
and<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.240> hit<00:04:23.510> him<00:04:23.600> hard<00:04:25.450> actually<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.510> know

and just hit him hard actually you know
what<00:04:26.630> I'm<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.080> even

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:55.439 

additional<00:04:46.270> pylons<00:04:48.150> that's<00:04:49.150> comical<00:04:54.210> just<00:04:55.210> to

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
additional pylons that's comical just to

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.890 
additional pylons that's comical just to
speak<00:04:55.870> dog<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.680> sick<00:04:56.889> he<00:04:56.919> canceled<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.900> which

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
speak dog so sick he canceled that which

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.990 
speak dog so sick he canceled that which
probably<00:04:59.169> gave<00:04:59.439> him<00:05:02.610> he's<00:05:03.610> probably<00:05:03.639> gonna

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
just pump out a whole lot of units at

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.059 
just pump out a whole lot of units at
this<00:05:05.680> point<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.550> don't<00:05:06.610> blame<00:05:06.879> them<00:05:07.029> I<00:05:08.069> am

this point and I don't blame them I am
supply<00:05:09.520> block<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:10.270> right<00:05:10.479> now<00:05:10.509> which<00:05:10.870> I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
supply block to right now which I

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.990 
supply block to right now which I
just<00:05:11.229> just<00:05:11.650> noticed<00:05:12.069> so<00:05:12.639> I'm<00:05:12.699> gonna<00:05:12.789> go<00:05:12.969> ahead

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
just just noticed so I'm gonna go ahead

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.339 
just just noticed so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:05:13.180> shut<00:05:13.389> down<00:05:13.539> two<00:05:16.560> pylons<00:05:19.020> put<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.110> probe

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
and shut down two pylons put this probe

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.779 
and shut down two pylons put this probe
up<00:05:20.500> here<00:05:20.620> on<00:05:20.740> this<00:05:20.830> tower<00:05:21.069> so<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.520> can<00:05:21.639> get<00:05:21.729> some

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
up here on this tower so I can get some

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.629 
up here on this tower so I can get some
sort<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.509> thing<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:23.800> he<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.009> scanning<00:05:24.310> so

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
sort of thing so he is scanning so

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:32.800 
sort of thing so he is scanning so
that's<00:05:24.759> one<00:05:24.969> scan<00:05:25.300> down

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.810 

go<00:05:33.440> ahead<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.740> hot<00:05:33.889> keep<00:05:34.160> my<00:05:34.930> Robo<00:05:36.700> I'm<00:05:37.700> gonna

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
go ahead and hot keep my Robo I'm gonna

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.390 
go ahead and hot keep my Robo I'm gonna
start<00:05:38.030> pumping<00:05:38.360> out<00:05:38.450> units<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.980> course<00:05:43.220> I

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
start pumping out units and of course I

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.860 
start pumping out units and of course I
had<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.550> keep<00:05:43.730> building<00:05:43.970> probes<00:05:44.419> that<00:05:44.600> is<00:05:44.840> a

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
had to keep building probes that is a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.590 
had to keep building probes that is a
must<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:49.400> I'm<00:05:49.460> gonna<00:05:49.550> try<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:49.820> get<00:05:50.000> out<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.180> whole

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
must so I'm gonna try to get out a whole

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.700 
must so I'm gonna try to get out a whole
bunch<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:51.020> these<00:05:51.139> games<00:05:51.350> guys<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:53.780> know<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.139> I

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
bunch of these games guys you know I I

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.730 
bunch of these games guys you know I I
stream<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.610> lot<00:05:55.850> of<00:05:55.970> my<00:05:56.060> games<00:05:56.500> but<00:05:57.500> I'm<00:05:57.590> gonna

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
stream a lot of my games but I'm gonna

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.850 
stream a lot of my games but I'm gonna
start<00:05:58.310> putting<00:05:58.940> up<00:05:59.210> as<00:05:59.389> many<00:06:02.080> of<00:06:03.080> these<00:06:03.500> as<00:06:03.560> I

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
start putting up as many of these as I

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:14.310 
start putting up as many of these as I
can

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.570 

all<00:06:15.320> right<00:06:15.470> I<00:06:15.710> take<00:06:16.040> them<00:06:16.160> in<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.310> good<00:06:16.460> position

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
all right I take them in a good position

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.800 
all right I take them in a good position
right<00:06:16.910> now<00:06:21.880> you<00:06:22.880> must<00:06:23.150> construct<00:06:23.330> additional

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
right now you must construct additional

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:33.119 
right now you must construct additional
pylons

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.730 

so<00:06:34.129> once<00:06:34.309> my<00:06:34.520> observer<00:06:34.879> comes<00:06:35.210> over<00:06:35.539> I'm<00:06:36.499> going

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
so once my observer comes over I'm going

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.739 
so once my observer comes over I'm going
to<00:06:36.830> get<00:06:36.979> vision<00:06:37.339> up<00:06:37.490> here<00:06:37.789> on<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.119> ledge<00:06:38.330> and

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
to get vision up here on the ledge and

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.749 
to get vision up here on the ledge and
then<00:06:39.710> I'm<00:06:39.800> basically<00:06:40.159> just<00:06:40.369> going<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.610> pick

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
then I'm basically just going to pick

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:47.109 
then I'm basically just going to pick
him<00:06:40.879> apart<00:06:40.969> and<00:06:42.309> force<00:06:43.309> him<00:06:45.460> to<00:06:46.460> come<00:06:46.789> down<00:06:46.849> off

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:47.119 
him apart and force him to come down off

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.369 
him apart and force him to come down off
that<00:06:47.270> ramp<00:06:47.479> and<00:06:47.659> then<00:06:47.779> i'll<00:06:47.869> use<00:06:47.899> my<00:06:48.020> force

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
that ramp and then i'll use my force

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:54.070 
that ramp and then i'll use my force
field<00:06:48.669> to<00:06:49.669> cut<00:06:49.849> his<00:06:49.939> units<00:06:50.180> in<00:06:50.270> half<00:06:52.960> just<00:06:53.960> like

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
field to cut his units in half just like

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:06.780 
field to cut his units in half just like
that

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:13.270 

oh<00:07:07.170> she's

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:25.820 

shouldn't<00:07:13.970> a<00:07:14.000> loss<00:07:14.150> any<00:07:14.389> mortal<00:07:16.010> happens

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.170 

so<00:07:26.830> I'm<00:07:26.919> punishing<00:07:27.160> them<00:07:27.490> right<00:07:27.669> now<00:07:27.820> for

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
so I'm punishing them right now for

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.480 
so I'm punishing them right now for
trying<00:07:28.690> to<00:07:28.750> do<00:07:28.840> a<00:07:28.870> fast<00:07:29.080> expansion<00:07:29.530> on<00:07:29.800> me

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.999 

basically<00:07:35.300> my<00:07:35.449> crowing<00:07:35.750> at<00:07:35.870> this<00:07:36.020> point<00:07:36.259> and

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:37.009 
basically my crowing at this point and

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.379 
basically my crowing at this point and
that<00:07:37.069> should<00:07:37.639> be<00:07:37.729> game<00:07:38.530> yep<00:07:39.530> ragequit<00:07:40.360> so<00:07:41.360> I

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389 
that should be game yep ragequit so I

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.020 
that should be game yep ragequit so I
kind<00:07:42.199> of<00:07:42.259> got<00:07:42.380> lucky<00:07:42.650> there<00:07:42.800> I<00:07:42.910> scattered<00:07:43.910> out

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030 
kind of got lucky there I scattered out

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.460 
kind of got lucky there I scattered out
his<00:07:44.150> expansion<00:07:44.539> he<00:07:44.870> was<00:07:44.960> trying<00:07:45.199> to<00:07:45.229> be<00:07:45.349> greedy

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470 
his expansion he was trying to be greedy

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.760 
his expansion he was trying to be greedy
and<00:07:45.800> I<00:07:46.580> punished<00:07:46.819> them<00:07:47.090> for<00:07:47.120> it<00:07:47.560> once<00:07:48.560> i<00:07:48.650> got

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770 
and I punished them for it once i got

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.890 
and I punished them for it once i got
that<00:07:48.889> observer<00:07:49.280> that<00:07:49.490> was<00:07:49.639> basically<00:07:49.819> it<00:07:50.150> you

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:50.900 
that observer that was basically it you

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.930
