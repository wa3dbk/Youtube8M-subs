00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.780
 video of today I'm going to teach how 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.940
 to fix the broken shadow 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.039
 I live in makeup these days I was 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.400
 using this palette of shadows here muqui 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.529
 pallets da lang is a makeup line 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 it was opened in the year 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.149
 and then I was suddenly using I 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.770
 step that bahia shadows do it all 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.829
 the one that asked for his supercombinado half 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.440
 A beautiful shadow knows no people I remembered 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.620
 that has how to fix the shadow was 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 I went and I tested and it gave me a supercert already 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.030
 I had seen some places but I never 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 I had tested it and it gave me super sure is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.780
 the guy has to do he has to show 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.670
 For the girls you really did not think 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.949
 it was going to be so easy so easy then 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 If you want to learn well with me? 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 I separated two honbridge I had 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.180
 broken at home 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.359
 by chance, the two are in the area of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 cosmetics but so is any shade 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.689
 works as long as it's shadow 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.640
 compact ok to be compact Hebron 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 compact everything and crashed park 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.920
 work in the same technique 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 Okay, and it looks like the two nieces and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 he is cosmetic 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.759
 This is a black one and here is a washcloth. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.409
 champagne like that and so I can not say 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 It is that I've left open and this one is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.979
 the black one both are broken and I go 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 to fix and show you the magic is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.100
 very cool 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.810
 so come on and all that you go 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 need to fix your parasol 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 broken is alcohol 70% have to be some 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 see you later 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 Thank you, it looks like it has a question of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.409
 evaporation and such I can not explain 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 very well and you also need to 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.009
 hydrogen 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.299
 only this is very easy, so let's go 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.079
 that I'll teach you how you can 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 now the camera comes because it moves I go 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.939
 start with this shadow that clarinha 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.680
 Here is my shampoo shadow I go 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.020
 start with your shade 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 here is the 10 champagne cosmetic shadow 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.200
 What are you going to do, will you get one? 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.200
 little alcohol 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:22.280
 q ta through it you'll catch a 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.390
 the focus within Somalia is 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.010
 country after you played to feel that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.010
 It's little you can play a little bit more 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.850
 the role of tam fell much later than 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.340
 be it every game goal you 'll get the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.420
 toilet paper and will press against 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.280
 shadow 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.650
 who wants to do what they 're going to do with 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.000
 what access of alcohol leaves look he left 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.510
 here and you get the same xata do 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.370
 that compress again the shadow 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.560
 ok you have to tighten it is to 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.200
 that it will be compacted again because 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.080
 otherwise she may hear assoluta later 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.470
 again also if you do not pack well 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.590
 and she'll be like this in Brazil 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.590
 image nothing totally stuck is also 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.150
 good 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.010
 after you compact your shade well 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.080
 It's late and here you will leave. 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.660
 dry the ideal is to let it dry 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.310
 at least a couple of hours from here 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.840
 I'm not going back here to see how she 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.680
 stayed and will have the rest of the video for 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.500
 You a little kiss then I am 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.709
 very happy because it gave super right the end 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.590
 of the two shades both on the black against 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.140
 champagne today I'm here none 22 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.510
 but it fell like I could do 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.290
 so I fell short of everything 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.840
 How much is it? 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.660
 now they are here beautiful and compact 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.140
 and ready to use again now use 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.870
 normal you take your brush and it comes out 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.140
 on hand 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.099
 really, there really has been 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.319
 very good 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.209
 this technique is very good if you 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.860
 have any questions 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.239
