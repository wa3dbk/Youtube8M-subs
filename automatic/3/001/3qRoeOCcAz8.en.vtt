00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.660 
fill the place of the diamond or as it's
known<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.240> called<00:00:21.810> Canada's<00:00:22.289> c8<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
known now called Canada's c8 which is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.189 
known now called Canada's c8 which is
basically<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> same<00:00:24.300> weapon<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.750> then<00:00:24.900> for

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
basically the same weapon is then for

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
basically the same weapon is then for
just<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> few<00:00:25.859> minor<00:00:26.070> tweaks<00:00:26.369> but

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
just with a few minor tweaks but

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.910 
just with a few minor tweaks but
appearances<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.019> performance<00:00:28.439> wise<00:00:28.619> it's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
appearances and performance wise it's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
appearances and performance wise it's
pretty<00:00:29.130> much<00:00:29.220> identical<00:00:29.510> we<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.630> tend<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> see

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
pretty much identical we do tend to see

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
pretty much identical we do tend to see
various<00:00:31.349> types<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.710> optics<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.340> those<00:00:32.579> c8<00:00:33.000> from

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
various types of optics on those c8 from

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
various types of optics on those c8 from
various<00:00:33.840> videos<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.590> images<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
various videos and images but one of the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.520 
various videos and images but one of the
most<00:00:36.210> common<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> EOTech<00:00:37.320> holographic

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
most common is the EOTech holographic

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
most common is the EOTech holographic
sight<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.579> we'll<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> hollow<00:00:39.120> sight

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
sight so we'll go to the hollow sight

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.319 
sight so we'll go to the hollow sight
for<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.020> optic<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.440> battlefield<00:00:40.860> 4<00:00:41.300> now<00:00:42.300> for

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
much more similar to those laser sights

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840 
much more similar to those laser sights
they<00:00:58.530> tend<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> other<00:00:59.609> side<00:00:59.820> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
underside of the weapon I just do as

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.070 
underside of the weapon I just do as
much<00:01:05.850> research<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.840> couldn't

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
much research as I can but I couldn't

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
much research as I can but I couldn't
find<00:01:07.229> exactly<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> model<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> spec

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
find exactly what the model of the spec

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
find exactly what the model of the spec
was<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.080> exact<00:01:10.500> laser<00:01:10.830> sight<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
was for this exact laser sight but the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
was for this exact laser sight but the
closest<00:01:11.909> model<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
closest model I can make it out to be is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.690 
closest model I can make it out to be is

same Picatinny rail system so if you are
picking<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.130> PQ<00:01:26.729> 14<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> laser<00:01:28.020> sight

that's<00:01:28.500> used<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.920> jtf2

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that's used by jtf2

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.249 
that's used by jtf2
there's<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> accessories<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
there's one of the accessories in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.600 
there's one of the accessories in
battlefield<00:01:31.680> 4<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.159> does<00:01:32.280> look<00:01:32.400> very

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
battlefield 4 that does look very

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
battlefield 4 that does look very
similar<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.150> appearance<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> green

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
similar in appearance that's the green

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
similar in appearance that's the green
laser<00:01:34.710> sight<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.759> while<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> green<00:01:36.299> laser

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
laser sight so while the green laser

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
laser sight so while the green laser
doesn't<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.200> match<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> actual<00:01:38.130> model
