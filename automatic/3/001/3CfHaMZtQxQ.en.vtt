 hello everybody is francesco 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.240
 darts and today I will make a different video 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.919
 from the usual 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 indeed I will make you a tutorial on how 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.030
 connect your macbook and imac with 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.050
 any apple computer device 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.850
 gross to your TV 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 let's start then since the computers 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.939
 windows is always there with the video entry 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.000
 all for mac instead we say a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.360
 easier to sell for having the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.850
 maximum maximum also of power and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.550
 need an hdmi cable that goes up to 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.710
 your TV and an adapter 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 thunderbolt and then what adapter 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.360
 having which the hdmi entry and instead must 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.329
 connect to the entrance of yours 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 laptop but I know that slightly 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.579
 as I saw it because the pixels of the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.199
 TV not different from the one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 computer 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.930
 but this way maybe to play at 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 minecraft on your TV set example 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.250
 at the moment i 'm playing in which to go 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 the server who makes the point and there I 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 here we go 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.020
 here it is 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.250
 I'm Brescia doesn't close anything here 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 it's all OK 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.540
 this was an example of minecraft and if 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.610
 I leave the game safari here I'm downloading 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.900
 my next video because I don't know if 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 he will have succeeded then if they still have to 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.070
 quit when I'm doing this though 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 I hope you enjoyed the tutorial 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.650
 anyway little advice 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.720
 this one is very difficult to find here 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.720
 the shop better to buy it on amazon 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.750
 nothing seems to have maybe someone has 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.040
 trouble telling the colleague this 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.920
 colleague he works never works 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.770
 then low that for more in 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:16.570
 television that city but journey to tv 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.600

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.300
 i don't know how hdmi 2 appears to you 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.150
