kind we have a transmission jack just

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.340 
kind we have a transmission jack just
for<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.620> jobs<00:00:44.660> if<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> jack<00:00:46.170> you

for these jobs if you have a jack you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
for these jobs if you have a jack you
can<00:00:46.379> support<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.969> take<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.149> center<00:00:48.420> piece

out

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
out

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.079 
out
rear-drive<00:00:50.600> line<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.219> 14<00:00:52.219> millimeter<00:00:52.730> bolts

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
rear-drive line is 14 millimeter bolts

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.229 
rear-drive line is 14 millimeter bolts
and<00:00:53.300> square<00:00:53.660> nuts<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.260> back<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:55.730> also<00:00:55.969> I

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
and square nuts on the back and also I

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.430 
and square nuts on the back and also I
believe<00:00:56.539> up<00:00:57.289> here's<00:00:57.559> two<00:00:57.739> brackets

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
believe up here's two brackets

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.860 
believe up here's two brackets
so<00:00:59.980> dark<00:01:00.309> two<00:01:00.730> brackets<00:01:01.180> up<00:01:01.329> there<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.690> hold

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
so dark two brackets up there that hold

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.770 
so dark two brackets up there that hold
the<00:01:02.019> drive<00:01:02.260> line<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:04.180> place<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.689> I<00:01:04.750> think

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
the drive line in place and I think

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.850 
the drive line in place and I think
there<00:01:04.989> were<00:01:05.049> also<00:01:05.170> 14<00:01:05.680> millimeter<00:01:06.070> bolts

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
there were also 14 millimeter bolts

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.070 
there were also 14 millimeter bolts
that's<00:01:08.860> what<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.130> looks<00:01:09.310> like<00:01:09.430> here<00:01:10.080> these

that's what it looks like here these

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.850 
that's what it looks like here these

the<00:02:26.150> instructions<00:02:27.080> did<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.440> say<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:28.099> take

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
the instructions did not say to take

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.910 
the instructions did not say to take
part<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> console<00:02:29.269> simply<00:02:29.630> said<00:02:29.810> take<00:02:30.709> off

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
part the console simply said take off

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.670 
part the console simply said take off
the<00:02:31.250> shift<00:02:31.610> knob<00:02:31.819> which<00:02:32.480> unscrews<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.349> then

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the shift knob which unscrews and then

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.030 
the shift knob which unscrews and then
pull<00:02:34.130> off<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.550> shaft<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.060> didn't<00:02:35.300> say<00:02:35.390> how<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
pull off the shaft I didn't say how to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.590 
pull off the shaft I didn't say how to
and<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> actually<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:39.880> c-clip<00:02:40.880> or<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.330> clip

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and there is actually a c-clip or a clip

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.030 
and there is actually a c-clip or a clip
inside<00:02:41.989> underneath<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.500> rubber<00:02:42.769> boot

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
inside underneath this rubber boot

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.039 
inside underneath this rubber boot
but<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.579> was<00:02:44.730> able<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.030> never<00:02:45.599> really<00:02:45.780> get<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
but I was able to never really get a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.580 
but I was able to never really get a
good<00:02:46.200> shot<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.659> from<00:02:48.659> above<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.049> check<00:02:49.469> out

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
good shot at it from above so check out

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.940 
good shot at it from above so check out
six<00:02:50.599> twelve<00:02:51.599> millimeter<00:02:51.840> bolts<00:02:52.439> out<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.590> here

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
six twelve millimeter bolts out of here

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.470 
six twelve millimeter bolts out of here
and<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.459> can<00:02:53.579> see<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.790> nice<00:02:53.969> little<00:02:54.030> knobby

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
and you can see that nice little knobby

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.020 
and you can see that nice little knobby
thing<00:02:54.629> that<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.920> fits<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.459> hole<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.909> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
thing that just fits in a hole on the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.569 
thing that just fits in a hole on the
back<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> transmission<00:02:58.189> might<00:02:59.189> shoot<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
back of the transmission might shoot it

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.229 
back of the transmission might shoot it
a<00:02:59.609> little<00:02:59.730> bit<00:02:59.849> later

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
a little bit later

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.619 
a little bit later
right<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.709> back<00:03:02.329> there's<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
right there is the back there's just a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:16.320 
right there is the back there's just a
hole<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.709> get<00:03:04.799> it

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.300 

so<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.290> sure<00:03:17.440> when<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.620> drop<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.070> back

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
so to make sure when I drop that back

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.750 
so to make sure when I drop that back
down<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.580> get<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.030> round<00:03:19.540> knob<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.380> hole

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
down I get the round knob in the hole

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.600 
down I get the round knob in the hole
this<00:03:21.760> was<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.180> releasing<00:03:22.690> all<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> way

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.400 

you<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.270> see<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> video<00:03:27.840> camera<00:03:28.080> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you can see it on the video camera that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.290 
you can see it on the video camera that
the<00:03:28.500> lower<00:03:28.680> section<00:03:29.160> actually<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.700> bent<00:03:30.090> in

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
the lower section actually is bent in

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.630 
the lower section actually is bent in
farther<00:03:30.750> those<00:03:31.470> fingers<00:03:32.810> right<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:34.640> bent

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
farther those fingers right there bent

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.710 
farther those fingers right there bent
in<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.980> we'll<00:03:38.070> be<00:03:38.190> taking<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.640> out<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
in so we'll be taking this out and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.550 
in so we'll be taking this out and
replacing<00:03:40.710> it<00:03:41.600> 12<00:03:42.600> millimeter<00:03:43.170> bolts<00:03:43.440> again

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
replacing it 12 millimeter bolts again

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.180 
replacing it 12 millimeter bolts again
around<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.280> there<00:03:45.230> what<00:03:46.230> else<00:03:46.380> 17<00:03:46.830> millimeter

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
around the there what else 17 millimeter

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.430 
around the there what else 17 millimeter
bolts<00:03:47.460> at<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.580> top

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.180 

up<00:03:53.010> here<00:03:53.690> are<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.750> two<00:03:54.990> ones<00:03:55.320> from<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.830> engine

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
up here are the two ones from the engine

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.920 
up here are the two ones from the engine
side<00:03:56.570> four<00:03:57.570> bolts<00:03:58.340> 17<00:03:59.340> millimeter<00:03:59.730> up<00:04:00.570> on<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
side four bolts 17 millimeter up on the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.480 
side four bolts 17 millimeter up on the
top

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.449 

and<00:04:03.580> get<00:04:04.330> those<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.690> long<00:04:04.960> extension

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.699 

I<00:04:07.489> had<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> long<00:04:08.360> extension<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.379> impact

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
I had a long extension and the impact

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.449 
I had a long extension and the impact
gun<00:04:10.299> right<00:04:11.299> here<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.629> setup<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.980> swivel<00:04:13.340> on

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
gun right here is a setup the swivel on

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.950 
gun right here is a setup the swivel on
the<00:04:13.610> end

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
the end

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.700 
the end
all<00:04:15.200> made<00:04:15.860> for<00:04:16.130> doing<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.460> kind<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.730> stuff<00:04:16.970> so

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
all made for doing this kind of stuff so

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.010 
all made for doing this kind of stuff so
and<00:04:18.710> once<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.550> take<00:04:19.910> this<00:04:20.240> crossmember<00:04:20.570> out

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
and once you take this crossmember out

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.440 
and once you take this crossmember out
right<00:04:21.230> here<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.090> drop<00:04:23.270> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
right here and you can drop the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.220 
right here and you can drop the
transmission

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
transmission

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.300 
transmission
down<00:04:24.560> three<00:04:25.130> or<00:04:25.160> four<00:04:25.280> inches<00:04:25.730> probably<00:04:25.940> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
down three or four inches probably and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.010 
down three or four inches probably and
then<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.490> easier<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.120> get<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.660> bolts<00:04:29.840> on

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
then it's easier to get to the bolts on

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.440 
then it's easier to get to the bolts on
the<00:04:30.110> top<00:04:30.140> of<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.470> transmission<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.450> those

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
the top of the transmission and those

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.860 
the top of the transmission and those
six<00:04:32.930> bolts<00:04:33.170> if<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.470> choose<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.680> go<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:33.920> way

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.870 

on<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.440> top<00:04:37.650> there<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:37.950> had<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.160> stubby<00:04:38.520> 12

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
on the top there I had a stubby 12

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.330 
on the top there I had a stubby 12
millimeter<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.540> regular<00:04:40.530> 12<00:04:40.800> millimeter<00:04:41.220> and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
millimeter and regular 12 millimeter and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.930 
millimeter and regular 12 millimeter and
as<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:41.700> get<00:04:41.820> all<00:04:42.000> those<00:04:42.180> bolts<00:04:42.810> loose<00:04:43.410> and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
as we get all those bolts loose and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.260 
as we get all those bolts loose and
everything<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.180> lefty<00:04:45.510> loosey<00:04:45.840> righty<00:04:45.870> tighty

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
everything is lefty loosey righty tighty

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.250 
everything is lefty loosey righty tighty
just<00:04:48.270> they're<00:04:48.389> all<00:04:48.480> bearing

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.910 

make<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.830> little<00:04:54.070> noise<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.740> basically

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
make a little noise so I just basically

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.760 
make a little noise so I just basically
wanted<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.580> show<00:04:57.790> you<00:04:57.850> this<00:04:58.060> video<00:04:58.770> almost

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
wanted to show you this video almost

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.820
