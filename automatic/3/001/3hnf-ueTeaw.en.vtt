00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
 [Music] 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.980
 I feel that I am rock and given that the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 school is about to start in this video 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
 I will show you how to decorate e 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.180
 customize your notebooks and journals 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.910
 let's start with that first method 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 what we need is the notebook or diary that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.730
 we want to customize, I buy everything 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 at the shop at 99 cents of the stickers 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.730
 and I chose these with cubes and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.070
 a scotch for decorations and I have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 chose this one with the lines I think 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 go very well with the stickers I have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 first choose to use Scotch tape on the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.960
 edge of the notebook take the measurements e 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.239
 then I stick it so the pieces that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
 advance the sticky inside the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.960
 notebook so not seen 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.600
 at this point I vent mine 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.320
 creativity and I'm going to add the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 stickers while you dice the anchors 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 [Music] 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 some little butterflies these 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.620
 Comic-style and continuous clouds 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 until I'm satisfied 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.370
 [Music] 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.840
 and here is the final result 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.250
 [Music] 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 for the second method what we do 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 serves is the notebook or diary from 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.690
 customize gift wrap with 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 of the fantasies that we like of the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.460
 glue and I chose this for you studies 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.250
 which is very durable and has brushes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.170
 to lay it down we start with cutting out the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 gift card more or less than the size 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:56.190
 of the notebook then we decide how we want 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.880
 place your fantasies 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.020
 I want them that way with the poohs inside 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 and roses on the outside and for this now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.340
 cut out the paper with roses in which 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 strips so that they will go on and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 under the notebook on the outside e 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.160
 a strip offers chubby chicory 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.489
 paper with polka dots for the inside 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.890
 of the monti ajo notebook and this must 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.650
 be exactly the same size 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 of the notebook 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 [Music] 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.220
 now that we have all three pieces 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.240
 necessary to let the paste 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.710
 [Music] 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.080
 Protein the notebook from the glue with a 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.760
 bit of baking paper and then I go to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.760
 spread the glue with the brush 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.670
 I place the card on the rose hill I press 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.260
 good for speaking lire and I repeat everything 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.260
 with paper with polka dots 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.449
 [Music] 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.110
 at this point, fold the card with the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:26.170
 excess roses and neck on the back 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:29.189
 of the cover of the notebook leaves 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.870
 dry and do the same thing 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:43.530
 on the other side of the notebook 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:47.879
 [Music] 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.879
 and this is the final result 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.860
 for the third method what we need 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:58.190
 is a diary notebook to personalize 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.790
 of expert blackboard painting a 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.890
 normal scotch brush and something 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.500
 to protect the table is ours 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.510
 book from painting in fact we begin 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.360
 placing the notebook on top of a 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.670
 cannoncino or cartoon and I add the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.950
 baking paper under the cover for 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.109
 protect the notebook and then take it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.630
 scotch and apply it to the port of 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.880
 notebook and so as to obtain at the end a 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.880
 precise margin of culture 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.680
 and now we can spend ours 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.840
 I paint the first blackboard effect 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.470
 layer and wait for an hour or so 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.779
 dry 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.779
 [Music] 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.710
 and then I spent even a second 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.710
 layer 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:03.950
 [Music] 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.950
 when it is dry I remove the scotch 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.660
 here is our diary notebook 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.450
 blackboard and now you can draw us e 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.810

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:29.009
 rewrite just like a blackboard sail 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:29.009
