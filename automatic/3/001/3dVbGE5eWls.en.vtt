00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
moisture out here the bikes are pretty

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.990 
moisture out here the bikes are pretty
slick<00:00:38.110> when<00:00:38.320> they<00:00:38.410> get<00:00:38.559> wet<00:00:38.880> definitely<00:00:39.880> they

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
slick when they get wet definitely they

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.790 
slick when they get wet definitely they
are<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.390> plastic<00:00:40.899> can't<00:00:41.200> get<00:00:41.350> slippery

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
are that plastic can't get slippery

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.060 
are that plastic can't get slippery
they<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.399> cutouts<00:00:43.379> below<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.590> seat<00:00:44.890> where

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
