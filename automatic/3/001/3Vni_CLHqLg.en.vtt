00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
all the time I've seen very few flies

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.580 
all the time I've seen very few flies
that<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.130> better<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:09.150> hooking<00:01:09.900> fish<00:01:10.229> than<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that are better at hooking fish than a

Bob<00:01:14.420> popped<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> ballpark

Bob popped this one out of the ballpark
with<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.220> fly<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.330> there's<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.750> things

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with this fly but there's other things

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
with this fly but there's other things
about<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.280> effective<00:01:20.549> one

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
about it that make it so effective one

minnow<00:01:23.790> its<00:01:24.390> small<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.530> small<00:01:25.710> fly<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
minnow its small this is a small fly and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
minnow its small this is a small fly and
they<00:01:26.909> were<00:01:26.970> never<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.509> big<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
they were never really big and but I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.620 
they were never really big and but I
will<00:01:29.579> also<00:01:29.820> tell<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.299> thing<00:01:30.420> about

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
will also tell you one other thing about

this<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> small<00:01:31.560> fly<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.640> got

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this the small fly and when they got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
this the small fly and when they got
bigger<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.259> never<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.799> big

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
bigger is that they never really got big

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
bigger is that they never really got big
hooks<00:01:35.310> either<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:36.299> Bob<00:01:36.509> knew<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
hooks either because Bob knew that the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
hooks either because Bob knew that the
fish<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> eat<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> head<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
fish was going to eat the head and the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
fish was going to eat the head and the
hook<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.240> front<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.930> don't<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.320> much

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
hook was up front you don't get as much

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
hook was up front you don't get as much
torque<00:01:40.890> either<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> big<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.360> about

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
torque either but the big thing about

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.810 
torque either but the big thing about
these<00:01:43.079> flies<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.490> big

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
these flies is that they're not big

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.840 
these flies is that they're not big
these<00:01:45.210> fly<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> fish<00:01:46.409> comes<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:47.040> eats<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
these fly when a fish comes up eats it

the<00:01:48.119> whole<00:01:48.390> fly<00:01:48.689> goes<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.229> his<00:01:49.409> mouth<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.159> at

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the whole fly goes down his mouth and at

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
the whole fly goes down his mouth and at
which<00:01:50.460> point<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.079> the

which point you got to see where the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
which point you got to see where the
hooks<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> goes<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> flies<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
hooks you know it goes in the flies like

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.020 
hooks you know it goes in the flies like
this<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.750> sucked<00:01:55.079> into<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> fish's<00:01:55.829> mouth

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
this get sucked into the fish's mouth

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
this get sucked into the fish's mouth
most<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> time<00:01:57.479> when<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> fish<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
most the time when I get a fish on a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.580 
most the time when I get a fish on a
clauser<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.880> still<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> bottom<00:02:00.990> part<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
clauser it's still in the bottom part of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
clauser it's still in the bottom part of
the<00:02:01.710> fish's<00:02:02.100> mouth<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.420> relative

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the fish's mouth and that's a relative

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
the fish's mouth and that's a relative
point<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.700> look<00:02:05.909> over<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.329> I've

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
point because if you look over here I've

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.949 
point because if you look over here I've
got<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.829> fish<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:09.149> working<00:02:09.690> on

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
got this little fish that I'm working on

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.290 
got this little fish that I'm working on
right<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> mouth<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.120> it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
right now and you see the mouth and it's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
right now and you see the mouth and it's
about<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.989> me

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
about for me

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
about for me
about<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.920> structure<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> mouth<00:02:14.940> there's

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
about the structure of the mouth there's

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.660 
about the structure of the mouth there's
a<00:02:15.660> lot<00:02:16.050> more<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> lower<00:02:16.830> mandible<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.460> lot

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
a lot more on the lower mandible a lot

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.540 
a lot more on the lower mandible a lot
more<00:02:17.880> structure<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.540> lot<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:19.550> deviations

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
more structure a lot more deviations

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460 
more structure a lot more deviations
that<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.820> hook<00:02:21.150> could<00:02:21.330> get<00:02:21.540> hung<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.990> on<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.380> you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that a hook could get hung up on if you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.290 
that a hook could get hung up on if you
look<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> top<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.460> mouth<00:02:23.670> bass<00:02:23.970> or

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
look at the top of the mouth bass or

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
look at the top of the mouth bass or
trout<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.350> relatively<00:02:26.010> smooth<00:02:26.490> in

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
trout it's relatively smooth in

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.120 
trout it's relatively smooth in
comparison<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.140> was<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
comparison so that was one of the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
comparison so that was one of the
reasons<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.720> use<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:30.990> lot<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.380> dumbbell

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
reasons and we do use a lot of dumbbell

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.820 
reasons and we do use a lot of dumbbell
eyes<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.910> almost<00:02:33.120> always<00:02:33.510> invert<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.560> flies

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
eyes and I almost always invert my flies

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.980 
eyes and I almost always invert my flies
and<00:02:35.070> put<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> bottom<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.090> most<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and put them on the bottom and most of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.410 
and put them on the bottom and most of
the<00:02:37.080> reason<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.150> fact

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the reason is because I like the fact

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
the reason is because I like the fact
that<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.810> lower<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.380> hook<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.460> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
that the lower the hook is or the on the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.000 
that the lower the hook is or the on the
lower<00:02:41.790> jaw<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.540> more<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
lower jaw the more there is to get the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.670 
lower jaw the more there is to get the
hook<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.880> it's<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.390> lower<00:02:45.570> part<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.440> I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
hook in if it's on the lower part if I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
hook in if it's on the lower part if I
invert<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:47.520> I've<00:02:47.640> got<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> smoother<00:02:48.420> part

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
invert it now I've got a smoother part

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
invert it now I've got a smoother part
of<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.930> hook<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.740> that's<00:02:49.950> not<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.400> real

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
of that hook but that's not the real

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.480 
of that hook but that's not the real
reason<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.720> most<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.620> reason<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.370> is

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
reason I do it most of the reason is is

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.120 
reason I do it most of the reason is is
because<00:02:53.520> we<00:02:54.420> fish<00:02:54.660> our<00:02:54.900> flies<00:02:55.170> fast<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.950> we

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
because we fish our flies fast and we

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.790 
because we fish our flies fast and we
seldom<00:02:56.580> drag<00:02:57.209> our<00:02:57.450> flies<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.770> a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
seldom drag our flies you can take a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.310 
seldom drag our flies you can take a
Clausura<00:02:59.550> zonker<00:03:00.150> style<00:03:00.450> that's<00:03:00.690> upside<00:03:01.050> down

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
Clausura zonker style that's upside down

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.290 
Clausura zonker style that's upside down
you<00:03:01.500> got<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> lot<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.830> weeds<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.730> gonna<00:03:02.940> ride<00:03:03.270> a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
you got a lot of weeds it's gonna ride a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.820 
you got a lot of weeds it's gonna ride a
little<00:03:03.540> bit<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.050> you're<00:03:04.380> less<00:03:04.800> likely

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
little bit you know you're less likely

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.310 
little bit you know you're less likely
to<00:03:05.310> hook<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.630> work<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.050> we're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to hook up but work that we're

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.280 
to hook up but work that we're
retrieving<00:03:07.740> our<00:03:08.190> flies<00:03:08.430> pretty<00:03:08.850> fast<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
retrieving our flies pretty fast and so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.530 
retrieving our flies pretty fast and so
when<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> fish<00:03:11.250> comes<00:03:11.580> up<00:03:11.850> he's<00:03:12.060> coming<00:03:12.090> from

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
when the fish comes up he's coming from

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.140 
when the fish comes up he's coming from
the<00:03:12.720> bottom<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.440> he<00:03:13.500> ambushes<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.280> hook<00:03:14.610> he

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the bottom and he ambushes the hook he

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
the bottom and he ambushes the hook he
hits<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.720> fly<00:03:15.959> from<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> bottom<00:03:16.770> like<00:03:16.980> this

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
hits the fly from the bottom like this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.880 
hits the fly from the bottom like this
and<00:03:17.580> he<00:03:18.000> eats<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.959> want<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.350> end<00:03:19.650> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
and he eats it and I want to end that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.210 
and he eats it and I want to end that
lower<00:03:20.130> mandible<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.510> build<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.620> into<00:03:22.920> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
lower mandible so I build this into it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.550 
lower mandible so I build this into it
on<00:03:23.340> purpose<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.600> hook<00:03:24.870> point<00:03:25.230> down

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
on purpose I want that hook point down

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.280 
on purpose I want that hook point down
if<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.370> want<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> invert<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.239> that's<00:03:27.540> fine<00:03:28.019> you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
if you want to invert it that's fine you

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.410 
if you want to invert it that's fine you
just<00:03:28.320> got<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.800> make<00:03:29.010> sure<00:03:29.430> when<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
just got to make sure when you do that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.479 
just got to make sure when you do that
that<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.140> understand<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.250> weight<00:03:32.459> of

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
that you understand that the weight of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the eyes have to offset the weight if

the eyes have to offset the weight if
you're<00:03:34.290> getting<00:03:34.530> specially<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.009 
mean this fly has two hooks as do most
of<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:40.739> flies<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.360> have<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.810> make<00:03:42.989> sure

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
of my flies and so you have to make sure

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.320 
of my flies and so you have to make sure
that<00:03:43.440> those<00:03:43.620> eyes<00:03:43.980> are<00:03:44.310> heavy<00:03:44.519> enough<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> keep

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
that those eyes are heavy enough to keep

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.900 
that those eyes are heavy enough to keep
that<00:03:45.600> fly<00:03:45.870> inverted<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.310> doesn't<00:03:47.670> end<00:03:47.730> up

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
that fly inverted and it doesn't end up

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.949 
that fly inverted and it doesn't end up
getting<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.299> know<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.450> weight<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.840> these

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
getting you know the weight of these

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.840 
getting you know the weight of these
hooks<00:03:49.230> don't<00:03:49.560> start<00:03:49.830> pulling<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.340> off<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
hooks don't start pulling you off to the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.900 
hooks don't start pulling you off to the
side<00:03:51.150> your<00:03:51.840> flies<00:03:52.080> riding<00:03:52.590> sideways<00:03:52.890> now<00:03:53.340> so

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
side your flies riding sideways now so

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.070 
side your flies riding sideways now so
if<00:03:54.000> you're<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.299> do<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.630> make<00:03:54.840> sure<00:03:54.870> you

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
if you're going to do it make sure you

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.390 
if you're going to do it make sure you
compensate<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.799> make<00:03:55.950> sure<00:03:56.070> they're<00:03:56.190> heavy

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
compensate to make sure they're heavy

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.670 
compensate to make sure they're heavy
enough<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.450> reason<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.959> don't<00:03:58.019> do<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.560> is

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
enough but the reason I don't do it is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.920 
enough but the reason I don't do it is
because<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> seldom<00:03:59.580> make<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.209> like<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.690> close

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
because I seldom make up like it close

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.949 
because I seldom make up like it close
to<00:04:01.140> bottom<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.739> seldom<00:04:02.549> fish<00:04:02.970> them<00:04:03.150> into<00:04:03.750> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
to bottom I seldom fish them into the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.110 
to bottom I seldom fish them into the
depths<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.739> drag<00:04:05.190> him<00:04:05.459> on<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.760> buck<00:04:05.910> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
depths and like drag him on the buck I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.000 
depths and like drag him on the buck I
mean<00:04:06.299> next<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.690> never<00:04:06.959> do<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.290> do<00:04:07.410> that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
mean next to never do I do that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.220 
mean next to never do I do that
and<00:04:08.280> if<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.700> will<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.239> was<00:04:09.510> then<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.019> course

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
and if I will if I was then of course

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.350 
and if I will if I was then of course
the<00:04:10.350> clouds<00:04:10.590> would<00:04:10.769> be<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> great<00:04:11.250> option<00:04:11.519> but

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the clouds would be a great option but

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.570 
the clouds would be a great option but
for<00:04:12.570> me<00:04:12.690> personally<00:04:12.720> because<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.890> way<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.070> fish

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
for me personally because the way I fish

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.030 
for me personally because the way I fish
and<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.940> way<00:04:15.060> most<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.510> us<00:04:15.600> out<00:04:15.810> here<00:04:15.840> fish<00:04:16.290> or

knows Sara and when I was back there

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.000 
knows Sara and when I was back there
lots<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.299> structure<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.989> still<00:04:22.530> preferred

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
lots of structure I still preferred

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.490 
lots of structure I still preferred
these<00:04:23.250> hooks<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.940> still<00:04:24.599> prefer<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.960> hook<00:04:25.260> down

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
these hooks I still prefer to hook down

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
these hooks I still prefer to hook down
because<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.669> structure

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
because of the structure

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.320 
because of the structure
the<00:04:27.449> fish's<00:04:27.900> mouth<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.669> reason<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.270> don't

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
the fish's mouth so the reason I don't

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.360 
the fish's mouth so the reason I don't
do<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.050> because<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.440> way<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.590> fish<00:04:31.949> him<00:04:32.099> if<00:04:32.250> I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
do it is because the way I fish him if I

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.550 
do it is because the way I fish him if I
was<00:04:32.520> fishing<00:04:32.909> slow<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.449> dragging<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.080> lot<00:04:34.289> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
was fishing slow and dragging a lot I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.770 
was fishing slow and dragging a lot I
probably<00:04:35.190> haven't<00:04:35.699> tendency<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.360> invert<00:04:36.659> them

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
probably haven't tendency to invert them

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.629 
probably haven't tendency to invert them
a<00:04:36.870> little<00:04:37.080> bit<00:04:37.229> more<00:04:37.440> than<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.770> which<00:04:38.490> is

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
a little bit more than I do which is

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.460 
a little bit more than I do which is
very<00:04:38.699> very<00:04:39.539> seldom<00:04:40.349> so<00:04:41.190> great<00:04:41.849> question
