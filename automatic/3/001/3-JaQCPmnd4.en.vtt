you<00:00:04.440> have<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> tassel<00:00:04.859> Logic<00:00:05.370> Pro<00:00:05.960> -<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.049> brown

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
you have a tassel Logic Pro - the brown

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.860 
you have a tassel Logic Pro - the brown
earth<00:00:07.560> wire<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:12.320> -<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> red<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.860> white<00:00:14.870> live

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
earth wire and - the red and white live

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.750 
earth wire and - the red and white live
wire<00:00:17.090> all<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.420> way<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> logic<00:00:20.520> probe

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
wire all the way back to the logic probe

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630 
wire all the way back to the logic probe
on<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> end<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> logic<00:00:22.560> probe<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.100> I've

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
on the end of the logic probe here I've

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.859 
on the end of the logic probe here I've
got<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> clip<00:00:28.789> on<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> wire<00:00:30.090> with

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
got a and I get a clip on a wire with

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.430 
got a and I get a clip on a wire with
another<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> clip<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> end<00:00:33.440> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
another how I get a clip on the end so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
another how I get a clip on the end so
the<00:00:34.739> logic<00:00:35.070> probe<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.730> hit<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the logic probe is going to hit this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.430 
the logic probe is going to hit this
wire<00:00:37.129> which<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.370> P<00:00:38.820> boss<00:00:39.090> wire<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> can

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
wire which is the P boss wire if you can

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
wire which is the P boss wire if you can
see<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.770> red<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.010> blue<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.660> I've<00:00:42.660> used<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
see it's red and blue and I've used a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
see it's red and blue and I've used a
scotch<00:00:43.860> lock<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.520> tap<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
scotch lock here to tap into it so if I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.670 
scotch lock here to tap into it so if I
pop<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> end<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.739> logic<00:00:52.739> probe<00:00:54.469> onto<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pop the end of the logic probe onto the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.049 
pop the end of the logic probe onto the
data<00:00:56.550> bus<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:58.410> should<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.859> hi<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.059> ringing

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
data bus it should go hi I'm not ringing

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.510 
data bus it should go hi I'm not ringing
that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.439> logic<00:01:04.979> probe<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.580> hi

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that you here is a logic probe going hi

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.890 
that you here is a logic probe going hi
and<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:10.640> when<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> operate<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.450> doll<00:01:12.690> up

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.300 

I<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.990> see<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:22.560> logic<00:01:23.560> pole<00:01:23.770> being<00:01:24.010> dragged

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
I can see a logic pole being dragged

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.830 
I can see a logic pole being dragged
down<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:26.020> intercepts<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:28.240> signal<00:01:28.660> being

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
down as it intercepts the signal being

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.290 
down as it intercepts the signal being
sent<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.350> door<00:01:29.500> lock<00:01:32.160> so<00:01:33.160> now<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:36.300> that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
sent to the door lock so now I know that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.810 
sent to the door lock so now I know that
the<00:01:37.450> door<00:01:37.630> module<00:01:38.110> which<00:01:39.070> goes<00:01:39.370> here<00:01:39.820> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the door module which goes here and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.820 
the door module which goes here and
connects<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.120> door<00:01:43.420> lock<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.430> body

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
connects to the door lock and the body

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.620 
connects to the door lock and the body
computer<00:01:47.830> module<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.280> BCM<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:50.440> faulty

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
computer module the BCM is faulty

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.230 
computer module the BCM is faulty
because<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:52.750> I've<00:01:52.900> just<00:01:53.140> proven<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.880> signal

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
because as I've just proven the signal

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.410 
because as I've just proven the signal
is<00:01:55.330> being<00:01:55.480> sent<00:01:55.570> from<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.050> BCM<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> door

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
is being sent from the BCM to the door

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.530 
is being sent from the BCM to the door
module<00:01:59.640> however<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.940> door<00:02:01.090> locks<00:02:01.330> not

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
module however the door locks not

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.900 
module however the door locks not
opening
