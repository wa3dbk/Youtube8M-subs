it<00:01:19.799> seems<00:01:20.250> crazy<00:01:21.020> overpowered<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it seems crazy overpowered and in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.969 
it seems crazy overpowered and in
reality<00:01:22.860> yeah<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.450> crazy

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
reality yeah it is it's crazy

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
reality yeah it is it's crazy
overpowered<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.150> reason<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
overpowered but not for the reason you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
overpowered but not for the reason you
might<00:01:27.720> expect<00:01:28.250> although<00:01:29.250> being<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
might expect although being able to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
might expect although being able to
build<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> tower<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.600> lead<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> some

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
build a tower can lead to some

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.890 
build a tower can lead to some
completely<00:01:31.850> game-changing<00:01:32.850> plays<00:01:33.180> by

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
completely game-changing plays by

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
completely game-changing plays by
creating<00:01:34.380> an<00:01:34.530> incredible<00:01:35.130> siege<00:01:35.400> fall<00:01:35.729> back

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
creating an incredible siege fall back

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
creating an incredible siege fall back
or<00:01:36.180> perhaps<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.689> defensive<00:01:37.259> point<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> map

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
or perhaps a defensive point on the map

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
or perhaps a defensive point on the map
or<00:01:38.189> something<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.060> does<00:01:39.630> only<00:01:40.140> last

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
or something like that it does only last

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
or something like that it does only last
for<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.710> minute<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:42.000> killed<00:01:42.210> quite

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for one minute and can be killed quite

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
for one minute and can be killed quite
quickly<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.100> no

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
quickly so it's not like there's no

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
quickly so it's not like there's no
counter<00:01:44.729> play<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> although<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.170> still

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
counter play and although it is still

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
counter play and although it is still
really<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.159> good<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.060> fact<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
really really good the fact is is that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
really really good the fact is is that
the<00:01:48.990> tower<00:01:49.259> creating<00:01:49.740> passive<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> completely

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the tower creating passive is completely

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
the tower creating passive is completely
useless<00:01:51.570> during<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> laning<00:01:52.500> phase<00:01:52.860> making

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the tower building passive not so much

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.039 
the tower building passive not so much
overpowered<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> really

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
overpowered just really good and really

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.160 
overpowered just really good and really
cool<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.850> what<00:02:00.060> makes<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.450> passive<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
cool but what makes this passive so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
cool but what makes this passive so
overpowered<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.250> attack<00:02:02.640> speed<00:02:03.030> scaling

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

with<00:03:29.639> him<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.030> mid<00:03:30.209> though<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.690> might<00:03:30.840> still

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
with him in mid though so it might still

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.870 
with him in mid though so it might still
be<00:03:31.170> possible<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> play<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> middling<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.700> from

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
be possible to play a middling but from

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.330 
be possible to play a middling but from
what<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.150> tell<00:03:33.299> he<00:03:34.019> seems<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.980> top

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
what I can tell he seems to be a top

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.220 
what I can tell he seems to be a top
laner<00:03:35.700> he<00:03:36.329> doesn't<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> crowd<00:03:37.049> control

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
laner he doesn't have the crowd control

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.110 
laner he doesn't have the crowd control
to<00:03:37.560> be<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> support<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.310> he<00:03:38.609> doesn't<00:03:38.880> have<00:03:38.970> any

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to be a support and he doesn't have any

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.910

and as far as jungle goes that may be a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.110 
and as far as jungle goes that may be a

wild-card his jungle clear speed is not

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.479 
wild-card his jungle clear speed is not
that<00:03:45.359> bad<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.870> his<00:03:46.200> gangs<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.829> be<00:03:47.010> okay<00:03:47.280> since

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
that bad and his gangs can be okay since

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.520 
that bad and his gangs can be okay since
he<00:03:47.639> does<00:03:47.819> have<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> gap<00:03:48.359> closer<00:03:48.750> crowd<00:03:49.109> control

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
he does have a gap closer crowd control

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.069 
he does have a gap closer crowd control
as<00:03:49.680> well<00:03:49.739> as<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.100> follow-up<00:03:50.430> slow<00:03:50.910> but<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.630> don't

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
as well as a follow-up slow but I don't

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.629 
as well as a follow-up slow but I don't
think<00:03:52.260> you'll<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> good<00:03:52.859> jungler<00:03:53.220> since<00:03:53.519> his

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
think you'll be a good jungler since his

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.400 
think you'll be a good jungler since his
ultimate<00:03:54.090> isn't<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> good<00:03:55.200> for

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
ultimate isn't really that good for

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.960 
ultimate isn't really that good for
gangs<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.799> much<00:03:56.010> better<00:03:56.190> for<00:03:56.340> kiting<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
gangs it's much better for kiting and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.740 
gangs it's much better for kiting and
disengaging<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:59.000> far<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:00.090> teamfights<00:04:00.540> go

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.150 
disengaging as far as teamfights go
actually<00:04:00.989> kind<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> way<00:04:01.829> he<00:04:01.950> plays

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
actually kind of like the way he plays

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.740 
actually kind of like the way he plays
in<00:04:02.340> teamfights<00:04:02.549> due<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> high<00:04:03.480> range

nature of his soldiers as well as the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
nature of his soldiers as well as the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
which you will likely pick up by that

time<00:04:10.530> team<00:04:10.799> fights<00:04:11.040> happen<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.849> allows<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.299> to

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
time team fights happen it allows you to

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.180 
time team fights happen it allows you to
stay<00:04:12.599> really<00:04:12.959> far<00:04:13.169> back<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.560> teamfights<00:04:13.950> most

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
stay really far back and teamfights most

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.710 
stay really far back and teamfights most
of<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.370> time<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.269> contribute

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
of the time so you can contribute

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.180 
of the time so you can contribute
without<00:04:16.079> putting<00:04:16.289> yourself<00:04:16.709> too<00:04:16.889> much<00:04:17.039> at

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
without putting yourself too much at

without putting yourself too much at
risk<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.549> then<00:04:17.970> as<00:04:18.090> soon<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.389> things<00:04:18.539> look

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
risk and then as soon as things look

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.259 
risk and then as soon as things look
good<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.500> jump<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.950> with<00:04:20.099> your<00:04:20.280> e<00:04:20.489> now

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
good you can jump in with your e now

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
and then you use the passive on the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.710 
and then you use the passive on the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
try to fight you you can just cake back

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.310 
try to fight you you can just cake back
to<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.760> tower<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.240> then<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.720> tower<00:04:51.930> can<00:04:52.140> just

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
to the tower and then the tower can just

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.720 
to the tower and then the tower can just
basically<00:04:52.500> just<00:04:52.890> hit<00:04:53.070> them<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.340> whole<00:04:53.490> fight

basically just hit them the whole fight
is<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.940> lot<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.240> players<00:04:54.420> won't<00:04:55.050> really<00:04:55.380> respect

is a lot of players won't really respect

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.830 
is a lot of players won't really respect
the<00:04:55.980> damage<00:04:56.310> even<00:04:56.700> though<00:04:56.880> it's<00:04:57.360> about<00:04:57.660> as

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
the damage even though it's about as

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
the damage even though it's about as
strong<00:04:58.080> as<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.290> regular<00:04:58.680> tower<00:04:58.890> anyways<00:04:59.490> so<00:04:59.940> it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
strong as a regular tower anyways so it

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.820 
strong as a regular tower anyways so it
can<00:05:00.210> lead<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.420> an<00:05:00.660> easy<00:05:00.930> place<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.260> cut<00:05:01.620> through

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
can lead to an easy place to cut through

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.680 
can lead to an easy place to cut through
as<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.130> wait<00:05:02.280> for<00:05:02.490> another<00:05:02.670> wave<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.240> siege<00:05:03.480> or

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
as you wait for another wave to siege or

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.270 
as you wait for another wave to siege or
more<00:05:04.140> likely<00:05:04.350> it's<00:05:04.680> going<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.980> lead<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.160> an

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
more likely it's going to lead to an

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.190 
more likely it's going to lead to an
easy<00:05:05.670> team<00:05:06.000> fight<00:05:06.180> win<00:05:06.390> if<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.660> opponents<00:05:07.080> go

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
easy team fight win if the opponents go

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.900 
easy team fight win if the opponents go
in<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.650> while<00:05:07.830> you're<00:05:08.040> seeing<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.730> it<00:05:08.850> just

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
in on you while you're seeing so it just

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.180 
in on you while you're seeing so it just
creates<00:05:09.360> kind<00:05:09.570> of<00:05:09.750> this<00:05:09.870> stuff<00:05:10.800> between<00:05:11.130> a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
creates kind of this stuff between a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.220 
creates kind of this stuff between a
rock<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.790> hard<00:05:11.820> place<00:05:12.090> situation<00:05:12.990> for<00:05:13.170> the

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
rock and a hard place situation for the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.570 
rock and a hard place situation for the
opponents<00:05:13.650> which<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:13.950> really<00:05:14.190> really<00:05:14.340> good

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
opponents which is really really good

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.060 
opponents which is really really good
for<00:05:14.820> your<00:05:14.910> team<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.870> overall<00:05:16.320> he<00:05:16.740> doesn't

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
for your team but overall he doesn't

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.400 
for your team but overall he doesn't
seem<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.280> be<00:05:17.490> crazy<00:05:18.030> overpowered<00:05:19.020> he<00:05:19.290> has<00:05:19.380> a

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
seem to be crazy overpowered he has a

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.620 
seem to be crazy overpowered he has a
fairly<00:05:19.890> high<00:05:20.040> skill<00:05:20.580> cap<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.030> his<00:05:21.150> passive

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
fairly high skill cap and his passive

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.180 
fairly high skill cap and his passive
requires<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.230> lot<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.530> strategy<00:05:23.160> and

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
requires a lot of strategy and

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.460 
requires a lot of strategy and
coordination<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.240> take<00:05:24.420> advantage<00:05:24.660> of<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.440> I

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
coordination to take advantage of so I

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.020 
coordination to take advantage of so I
don't<00:05:25.590> think<00:05:25.800> he's<00:05:26.010> overpowered<00:05:26.550> just<00:05:26.760> really

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
don't think he's overpowered just really

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.550 
don't think he's overpowered just really
good<00:05:27.210> one<00:05:27.540> of<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> main<00:05:27.900> weaknesses<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.410> he

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
good one of the main weaknesses that he

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.840 
good one of the main weaknesses that he
kind<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.800> struggles<00:05:29.190> with<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> lack<00:05:29.820> of

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
kind of struggles with is a lack of

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.060 
kind of struggles with is a lack of
burst<00:05:30.270> damage<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.810> his<00:05:30.930> kid<00:05:31.110> as<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.260> whole<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:31.980> if

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
burst damage in his kid as a whole so if

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.440 
burst damage in his kid as a whole so if
he<00:05:32.160> was<00:05:32.340> going<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:32.730> be<00:05:32.820> released<00:05:33.120> in<00:05:33.330> his

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
he was going to be released in his

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.000 
he was going to be released in his
current<00:05:33.690> state<00:05:33.810> he<00:05:34.200> would<00:05:34.380> probably<00:05:34.740> be

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
current state he would probably be

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.520 
current state he would probably be
viable<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.610> competitive<00:05:36.060> play<00:05:36.120> but<00:05:36.900> in<00:05:37.020> soloq

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
viable in competitive play but in soloq

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.590 
viable in competitive play but in soloq
have<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.770> fairly<00:05:38.310> low<00:05:38.460> win<00:05:38.730> rate<00:05:38.940> due<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.510> the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
have a fairly low win rate due to the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.780 
have a fairly low win rate due to the
difficulty<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.230> using<00:05:40.800> his<00:05:40.830> kid<00:05:41.130> effectively

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
difficulty of using his kid effectively

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.790 
difficulty of using his kid effectively
but<00:05:42.330> riot<00:05:42.570> definitely<00:05:43.050> succeeded<00:05:43.440> in<00:05:43.650> making
