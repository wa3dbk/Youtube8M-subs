now and I'm actually going to go over my
specializations<00:01:07.090> while<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.270> sit<00:01:07.510> here<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
specializations while I sit here in the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.480 
specializations while I sit here in the
menus<00:01:08.080> waiting<00:01:08.410> for<00:01:08.500> my<00:01:08.590> jet<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.920> respond<00:01:09.310> I

because<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> ground<00:01:14.700> specialized

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
because this is a ground specialized

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760 
because this is a ground specialized
video<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.509> basically<00:01:17.020> going<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.590> go<00:01:17.650> into

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
video is so basically going to go into

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.440 
video is so basically going to go into
my<00:01:17.890> specializations<00:01:18.640> here<00:01:18.850> you're<00:01:19.270> going<00:01:19.390> to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
my specializations here you're going to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.200 
my specializations here you're going to
see<00:01:19.509> me<00:01:19.780> use<00:01:20.080> beam<00:01:20.920> scanning<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:21.640> passed<00:01:22.000> it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
see me use beam scanning I passed it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.660 
see me use beam scanning I passed it
beam<00:01:22.479> scanning<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.080> our<00:01:23.440> flares<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.950> guided

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
beam scanning I our flares and guided

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450 
beam scanning I our flares and guided
missiles<00:01:25.030> i<00:01:25.180> donít<00:01:25.869> use<00:01:26.170> rocket<00:01:26.560> pods<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:27.100> don't

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
missiles i donít use rocket pods I don't

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.710 
missiles i donít use rocket pods I don't
like<00:01:27.520> them<00:01:27.759> I<00:01:27.940> don't<00:01:28.240> like<00:01:28.330> how<00:01:28.450> vulnerable

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
like them I don't like how vulnerable

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.719 
like them I don't like how vulnerable
they<00:01:29.020> make<00:01:29.170> me<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:30.009> know<00:01:30.130> they're<00:01:30.369> powerful

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
they make me and I know they're powerful

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.510 
they make me and I know they're powerful
but<00:01:31.420> i<00:01:31.750> just<00:01:32.619> don't<00:01:32.680> like<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:33.009> use<00:01:33.040> them<00:01:33.280> so

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
but i just don't like to use them so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.999 
but i just don't like to use them so
since<00:01:34.060> i<00:01:34.180> use<00:01:34.420> those<00:01:34.600> guided<00:01:34.990> missiles<00:01:35.320> i<00:01:35.530> use

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
since i use those guided missiles i use

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.249 
since i use those guided missiles i use
beam<00:01:36.280> scanning<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.910> kind<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.240> compliment<00:01:38.140> my

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
beam scanning to kind of compliment my

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.230 
beam scanning to kind of compliment my
guided<00:01:38.590> missiles<00:01:38.920> because<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.729> just<00:01:39.880> makes<00:01:40.119> it

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
guided missiles because it just makes it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.680 
guided missiles because it just makes it
easier<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.720> get<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.380> lock<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.069> i<00:01:42.670> missed<00:01:43.179> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
easier to get a lock on and i missed the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.540 
easier to get a lock on and i missed the
i<00:01:44.530> miss<00:01:45.280> my<00:01:45.460> jet<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.940> misspoke<00:01:46.690> jets<00:01:47.050> ah<00:01:49.500> fuck

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
i miss my jet I misspoke jets ah fuck

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.740 
i miss my jet I misspoke jets ah fuck
anyway<00:01:51.550> beam<00:01:51.819> scanning<00:01:52.149> just<00:01:52.390> makes<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.600> easy

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
anyway beam scanning just makes it easy

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.180 
anyway beam scanning just makes it easy
to<00:01:52.840> use<00:01:53.050> guided<00:01:53.259> missiles<00:01:53.649> I'll<00:01:53.860> be<00:01:54.069> right

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.410 
to use guided missiles I'll be right

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.440 
you do it fast enough if you turn around
fast<00:04:32.570> enough<00:04:32.930> while<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.190> reload<00:04:34.640> it<00:04:35.120> is

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
fast enough while you reload it is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.950 
fast enough while you reload it is
perfectly<00:04:36.110> possible<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:37.040> get<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.610> kill<00:04:37.960> you

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
perfectly possible to get a kill you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
the guy before they respawn so basically

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.710 
the guy before they respawn so basically
this<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:47.990> my<00:04:48.710> anti<00:04:49.700> ground<00:04:50.060> kind<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.450> loaded

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
this is my anti ground kind of loaded

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.360 
this is my anti ground kind of loaded
thing<00:04:50.930> it's<00:04:51.170> all<00:04:51.470> about<00:04:51.500> just<00:04:52.010> being<00:04:52.130> helpful

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
thing it's all about just being helpful

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.130 
thing it's all about just being helpful
it's<00:04:52.760> not<00:04:52.880> only<00:04:52.970> about<00:04:53.120> dominating<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:54.110> I

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
it's not only about dominating so I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.570 
it's not only about dominating so I
guess<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.380> if<00:04:54.890> anything<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.340> got<00:04:55.460> from

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
guess that if anything you got from

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
guess that if anything you got from
those<00:04:55.760> Clips<00:04:56.000> where<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.180> was<00:04:56.300> just<00:04:56.330> getting

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
those Clips where I was just getting

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.630 
those Clips where I was just getting
those<00:04:56.720> couple<00:04:57.080> vehicle<00:04:57.410> disables<00:04:57.800> take<00:04:58.430> that

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
those couple vehicle disables take that

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.130 
those couple vehicle disables take that
from<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.210> not<00:04:59.390> it's<00:04:59.540> about<00:04:59.630> helping<00:04:59.930> your

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
from it it's not it's about helping your

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.010 
from it it's not it's about helping your
team<00:05:00.350> not<00:05:01.160> dominating<00:05:02.320> basically<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:04.700> end

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
team not dominating basically the end

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.960 
team not dominating basically the end
