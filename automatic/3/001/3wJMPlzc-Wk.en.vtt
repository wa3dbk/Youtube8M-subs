President Obama's favorite to win if it

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.860 
President Obama's favorite to win if it
happens<00:03:52.879> today<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.359> think<00:03:53.449> there<00:03:53.750> are<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
happens today but I think there are a

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.199 
happens today but I think there are a
lot<00:03:54.109> of<00:03:54.139> outstanding<00:03:54.650> variables<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:56.060> we

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
lot of outstanding variables that we

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.939 
lot of outstanding variables that we
have<00:03:56.359> yet<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.629> see<00:03:56.930> how<00:03:56.959> they<00:03:57.290> play<00:03:57.439> out<00:03:57.680> I

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
have yet to see how they play out I

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.099 
have yet to see how they play out I
think<00:03:58.189> it's<00:03:58.459> entirely<00:03:58.879> possible<00:03:59.389> that<00:03:59.780> Mitt

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
think it's entirely possible that Mitt

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:00.939 
think it's entirely possible that Mitt
Romney<00:04:00.139> could<00:04:00.560> win

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
Romney could win

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.550 
Romney could win
remember<00:04:02.109> Republicans<00:04:03.109> have<00:04:03.229> been<00:04:03.290> looking

remember Republicans have been looking

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.759 
remember Republicans have been looking
at<00:04:03.650> at<00:04:03.799> Romney<00:04:03.979> since<00:04:04.659> 2006<00:04:05.659> 2007<00:04:06.470> when<00:04:06.739> he

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
at at Romney since 2006 2007 when he

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.780 
at at Romney since 2006 2007 when he
started<00:04:07.129> running<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.430> first<00:04:07.579> time

Republicans<00:04:08.470> likely<00:04:09.470> Republican<00:04:09.799> voters<00:04:10.189> and

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
Republicans likely Republican voters and

I'm happy to take on anything I think
Republicans<00:04:52.310> have<00:04:53.379> there's<00:04:54.379> the<00:04:54.530> saying

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
Republicans have there's the saying

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.309 
Republicans have there's the saying
Democrats<00:04:55.849> fall<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.419> love<00:04:56.599> Republicans<00:04:57.139> fall

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
Democrats fall in love Republicans fall

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.469 
Democrats fall in love Republicans fall
in<00:04:57.470> line<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:58.280> think<00:04:58.639> Republicans<00:04:58.940> are

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
in line I think Republicans are

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.149 
in line I think Republicans are
coalescing<00:05:00.110> around<00:05:00.169> Mitt<00:05:00.500> Romney<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.009> I

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
coalescing around Mitt Romney and I

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.100 
coalescing around Mitt Romney and I
think<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.729> general<00:05:02.090> electorate<00:05:02.449> who<00:05:02.690> has<00:05:02.840> not

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
think the general electorate who has not

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200 
think the general electorate who has not
followed<00:05:03.409> Mitt<00:05:03.680> Romney<00:05:04.009> for<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.250> last<00:05:04.490> six

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
followed Mitt Romney for the last six

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.809 
followed Mitt Romney for the last six
years<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.780> way<00:05:06.050> Republicans<00:05:06.620> have<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:07.069> really

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
years the way Republicans have is really

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.249 
years the way Republicans have is really
only<00:05:07.969> beginning<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.719> get<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.960> know<00:05:09.080> Mitt

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
only beginning to get to know Mitt

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.990 
only beginning to get to know Mitt
Romney<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.710> mean<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.979> convention<00:05:10.490> really<00:05:10.819> was

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
Romney I mean the convention really was

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.969 
Romney I mean the convention really was
the<00:05:11.599> first<00:05:11.840> time<00:05:12.110> he<00:05:12.259> had<00:05:12.409> a<00:05:12.440> national

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the first time he had a national

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.709 
the first time he had a national
platform<00:05:13.219> to<00:05:13.669> begin<00:05:13.759> to<00:05:13.969> make<00:05:14.120> his<00:05:14.300> case<00:05:14.479> there

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
platform to begin to make his case there

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.170 
platform to begin to make his case there
to<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.199> to<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.949> American<00:05:16.280> people<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.789> you

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
to the to the American people and you

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.149 
to the to the American people and you
have<00:05:17.360> these<00:05:17.840> four<00:05:18.139> percent<00:05:18.530> of<00:05:18.620> independents

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
have these four percent of independents

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.740 
have these four percent of independents
in<00:05:19.310> these<00:05:19.430> eight<00:05:19.669> battleground<00:05:20.240> states<00:05:20.569> in

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
in these eight battleground states in

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.899 
in these eight battleground states in
these<00:05:20.870> 300<00:05:21.500> counties<00:05:21.889> who<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.490> election

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
these 300 counties who the election

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.879 
these 300 counties who the election
really<00:05:23.120> rests<00:05:23.659> upon<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:24.319> don't<00:05:24.590> know<00:05:24.710> Mitt

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
really rests upon that don't know Mitt

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.770 
really rests upon that don't know Mitt
Romney<00:05:25.190> at<00:05:25.280> all<00:05:25.400> which<00:05:25.879> is<00:05:26.030> why<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.180> do<00:05:26.360> think

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
Romney at all which is why I do think

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.119 
Romney at all which is why I do think
you<00:05:26.870> have<00:05:26.900> these<00:05:27.229> three<00:05:27.560> presidential

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
you have these three presidential

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.040 
you have these three presidential
debates<00:05:28.159> they<00:05:28.909> could<00:05:29.120> actually<00:05:29.330> mean

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
debates they could actually mean

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.689 
debates they could actually mean
everything<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:30.620> think<00:05:30.800> probably<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.490> first

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
everything I think probably the first

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.309 
everything I think probably the first
presidential<00:05:32.090> bait<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.690> most<00:05:32.870> important

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
presidential bait is the most important

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.230 
presidential bait is the most important
one<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.710> think<00:05:34.129> that<00:05:34.280> Romney<00:05:34.550> has<00:05:34.789> to<00:05:35.060> do<00:05:35.210> very

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
one I think that Romney has to do very

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.209 
one I think that Romney has to do very
well<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.020> in<00:05:36.169> order<00:05:36.289> to<00:05:36.409> have<00:05:36.620> momentum<00:05:36.919> to

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
well in it in order to have momentum to

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.480 
well in it in order to have momentum to
go<00:05:37.340> or<00:05:37.520> else<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:37.819> think<00:05:37.880> President<00:05:38.719> Obama<00:05:38.960> wins

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
go or else I think President Obama wins

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.890 
go or else I think President Obama wins
could<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.520> just<00:05:40.729> say<00:05:40.849> something<00:05:40.880> about<00:05:41.270> Romney

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
could I just say something about Romney

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.559 
could I just say something about Romney
as<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.050> candidate<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:42.770> remember<00:05:43.759> starting<00:05:44.360> with

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
as a candidate I remember starting with

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.209 
as a candidate I remember starting with
Bill<00:05:44.810> Clinton<00:05:45.289> in<00:05:46.479> 1991<00:05:47.479> and<00:05:47.750> thinking<00:05:48.409> hmm

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
Bill Clinton in 1991 and thinking hmm

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.029 
Bill Clinton in 1991 and thinking hmm
he's<00:05:49.370> more<00:05:49.550> interesting<00:05:50.090> in<00:05:50.719> person<00:05:51.469> than<00:05:51.770> he

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
he's more interesting in person than he

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
of the Republican National Convention it

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.060 
of the Republican National Convention it
was<00:07:08.870> you<00:07:09.290> don't<00:07:09.410> like<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.710> last<00:07:09.860> four<00:07:10.010> years

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
was you don't like the last four years

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.370 
was you don't like the last four years
are<00:07:10.640> you<00:07:11.090> better<00:07:11.330> off<00:07:11.420> so<00:07:11.810> that's<00:07:11.930> a<00:07:12.080> default

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
are you better off so that's a default

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.040 
are you better off so that's a default
position<00:07:12.860> but<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:13.610> I<00:07:13.820> think<00:07:13.880> the<00:07:14.150> the<00:07:15.020> the

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
position but the I think the the the

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.170 
position but the I think the the the
other<00:07:15.620> side<00:07:15.920> is<00:07:16.100> also<00:07:16.250> true<00:07:16.640> I<00:07:16.790> think<00:07:16.820> that<00:07:17.090> the

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
other side is also true I think that the

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.550 
other side is also true I think that the
way<00:07:17.330> that<00:07:17.600> Obama<00:07:17.690> is<00:07:17.990> sort<00:07:18.260> of<00:07:18.320> framing

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
way that Obama is sort of framing

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.650 
way that Obama is sort of framing
himself<00:07:18.980> up<00:07:19.130> is<00:07:19.340> is<00:07:19.550> you<00:07:19.850> know<00:07:19.970> like<00:07:20.150> what<00:07:20.420> hat

himself up is is you know like what hat

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.510 
himself up is is you know like what hat
what<00:07:20.900> is<00:07:20.930> Romney<00:07:21.350> going<00:07:21.620> to<00:07:21.740> bring<00:07:21.950> you<00:07:22.100> you

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
what is Romney going to bring you you

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.010 
what is Romney going to bring you you
know<00:07:22.610> stick<00:07:23.090> with<00:07:23.270> what<00:07:23.450> you<00:07:23.600> have

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
know stick with what you have

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.720
