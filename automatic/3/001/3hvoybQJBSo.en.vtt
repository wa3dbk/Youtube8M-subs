00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and it shows everything if we are without card 5 and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.640
 well let's go there let's play a new 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 career with subscribers you already know that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 I'm inviting to do all this 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 type of races and the truth that I'm cool 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 very much you have a link in the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 description for how you can play 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.109
 with me I hope I do not forget 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 leave it but good simply what 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.560
 you have to do is follow me by 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.289
 twitter since out there notice and also 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 follow me in my kid so nothing 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.380
 there we will see what this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.980
 career that looks like a molar 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.810
 pretty to be here small jump 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 Careful care I hope not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 explode is worth well live as I am seeing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.510
 we are with the snowy map that the truth 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.649
 that I love this kind of racing like that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 although the truth is more complicated 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 because as you can see , the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.559
 car but I hope that I do not leave 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.360
 much is worth 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.910
 is that it costs a lot of plays like this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.100
 races since as I say of the jumps 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 someone who is complicated and then with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.559
 the snowy map as oysters is an added 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.620
 more so it's a lot harder 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.320
 okay, I hope I do not spend 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.860
 the important thing is that the car does not explode 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.020
 both are all less existent and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.490
 that he has done well we are going to try 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.390
 take advantage now here we have another 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.870
 we saltito 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
 like I seriously love the snowy map 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.720
 although you know that it leaves very little 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.250
 sure time when you are watching 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 this race you're no longer snowy map of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.190
 done but good while it 's going 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.119
 to take advantage of it and it's already the year that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.119
 it comes if they will put it back 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.600
 we do not have what we have 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 Let's go there 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.980
 I thought I was going to fall over there 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.390
 and I was going to roll it 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.990
 we go here all so white 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.230
 like the here environment here with this background 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.870
 well white pretty and now 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.160
 Be careful not to explode 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.160
 how will you explode uncle 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.520
 it seems that that's where everyone exploits it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.260
 there unless this one has done well 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.640
 so let's try now 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.190
 move forward we have to get it 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.780
 you have to get ahead if you do not 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.710
 It hit a lot and I do not like many streetlights 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.510
 and this I do well, I think we can 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.750
 go ahead here in the jump 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.240
 voucher voucher 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.440
 we follow second we follow seconds 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.900
 we have to overtake this seriously there 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.600
 that to advance it as it is we have it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.460
 close we hope that shock or something 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.190
 I believe that the goal has to be very 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.430
 very close I do not know why but it gives me that 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.069
 impression that it is close so if 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.659
 do not crash 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.659
 I do not think we can overtake it 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.190
 there has to be a jump or something has 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 that there must be something mister creator of the map 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:09.579
 with something is worth a jump have 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.969
 and now we are closer now we are 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.969
 closer 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.540
 perfect let's come come friend 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.800
 we have we do not have to do it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.800
 perfect now 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.910
 It's so perfect that we just got 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 advance 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.620
 but we can get it 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.709
 come on come on come on come on this is 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.160
 Epic making us kept us going forward 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.500
 choco collide 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.330
 and now we are super close 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.880
 and I hope the goal is not there yet 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.900
 I hope the goal is not there because it is 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.900
 the goal is the goal to the goal 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.650
 I shit on all uncle shit on everything 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.650
 we have had so close 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.540
 And he told me 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.590
 second I think it has been very very close 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.420
 I thought that in that jump I was ahead of him 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.700
 really if I had been the goal I think 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.290
 that a little further when we saw 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.080
 that has gone I think there would have been 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
 ahead because it's just like 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.250
 I was living in the jump in the air 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.540
 I was already almost ahead but good 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.450
 I think we'll see that in the end you 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.830
 stayed second then I'll look at it and now 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.270
 we will wait to see when the end 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.710
 but the truth is that I've been quite 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.900
 I'm going to this race I hope that I have 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.460
 you already know how to leave it and if you want 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.200
 keep climbing more races and be 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.270
 seeing that there are about 6 seconds left 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.670
 that is over so if half wait 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.840
 half to see how I have been but 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.520
 I think it was the end second steve 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.320
 and carlos unjustly in the jump was 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.610
 almost overtaking me nothing second like that 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.680
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.150
 leave and for massÃº cristian you are and we 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.150
 we see in the next see you later
