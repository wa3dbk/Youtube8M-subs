00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.380 
i think is this there's something on
large-scale<00:06:30.419> done<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.729> whether<00:06:32.729> that's<00:06:33.030> you

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
large-scale done and whether that's you

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.230 
large-scale done and whether that's you
know<00:06:33.720> done<00:06:34.020> by<00:06:34.200> players<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.919> officials<00:06:35.430> the
