00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 the new convert complained to the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.680
 pastor and say yes astor I 'm suffering 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 a problem with my brothers 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.060
 Look, I'm just entitled to a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.270
 my father's inheritance but my brothers 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.719
 want to take me the one they had and I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 I do not know what to do, I'm thinking of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 justice and fight with them in the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 court to claim my right 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.989
 the pastor told a friend 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.730
 not always a lawsuit is the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 best solution 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 Sometimes it is better to have a bad agreement from the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.260
 What a good fight at court. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 the young man said but shepherd 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.130
 They are wanting to advance in my 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.290
 right and take what belongs to you 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 and I'm not willing to give up 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.470
 I want to fight with them to prevent their 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 prayers because I'm going to go to court 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.259
 against my brothers and pastor said 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.650
 before you find a lawyer and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.100
 sue in the courts take a walk 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.200
 with me, let's walk a little bit for this 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 forest 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 The young man was a pastor, it's no use. 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 convince me not now I want to fight 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.270
 Even my brothers will not take it away. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.689
 It 's mine, I'm going to court. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 the pastor said after this tour you 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.580
 will make your decision 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.880
 Let's keep walking 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.430
 and when they were walking the pastor 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.250
 showed the young man an amount 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 of pigeons living together 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 harmoniously with the birds with 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.530
 knew with the ducks and the shepherd took 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.600
 one piece of bread and tossed there in the middle of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.990
 pigeons 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.640
 at that same time people shake 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.730
 all of which were in a folder so 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.350
 began to play and attack each other. 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.900
 one jumping over the other 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.080
 the ducks and the ducks when they saw 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.209
 food out front of the lake and 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.510
 also began to attack the pigeons at 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.930
 dispute that piece of bread and also 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.520
 the wise men and all the birds made the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.170
 same thing 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.330
 the pastor said you're seeing this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.680
 those birds were perfect peace and 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.200
 harmony 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 but when I threw the bread crumbs 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.800
 Look at the confusion that happened. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720
 Look at the fight that's watching you there. 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.170

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.209

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.180
 truck will produce a tragedy is a 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.110
 disgrace so great in his family that 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.110
 will not bring you any profit and the boy 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.870
 while listening the pastor continued 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.780
 watching the pigeons there the ducks 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.250
 sings of the SabiÃ¡s fighting over 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.269
 bread crumbs and the pastor told me ot 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.560

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:52.489

 fight for situations or issues 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:27.880
 of this life to confront brothers and sisters 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:32.669
 to destroy a relative because of a 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:36.519
