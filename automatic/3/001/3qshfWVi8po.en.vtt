do<00:05:20.350> we<00:05:20.550> fix<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:21.820> issue<00:05:22.060> do<00:05:22.840> we<00:05:22.960> go<00:05:23.140> through

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
do we fix this issue do we go through

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.500 
do we fix this issue do we go through
and<00:05:23.500> renumber<00:05:23.860> them<00:05:24.160> all<00:05:24.370> do<00:05:24.820> we<00:05:24.940> set<00:05:25.210> up<00:05:25.240> a

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
and renumber them all do we set up a

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.320 
and renumber them all do we set up a
block<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.200> not<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.500> counts<00:05:26.890> all<00:05:27.040> off<00:05:27.250> well<00:05:28.090> I

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
block is not the counts all off well I

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.930 
block is not the counts all off well I
realized<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:30.070> count<00:05:30.310> actually<00:05:30.760> isn't

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
realized that the count actually isn't

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.370 
realized that the count actually isn't
off<00:05:31.210> because<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.600> leap<00:05:31.780> year<00:05:31.810> we<00:05:32.110> should<00:05:32.169> have

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
off because the leap year we should have

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.950 
off because the leap year we should have
ended<00:05:32.560> on<00:05:32.860> May<00:05:33.070> 16th<00:05:33.910> but<00:05:34.570> we<00:05:34.660> didn't<00:05:34.870> because

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
ended on May 16th but we didn't because

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.469 
ended on May 16th but we didn't because
we<00:05:35.110> number<00:05:35.620> them<00:05:35.740> wrong<00:05:35.979> but<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:37.300> actually

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
we number them wrong but it actually

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.090 
we number them wrong but it actually
worked<00:05:37.810> out<00:05:38.050> because<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.500> leap<00:05:38.650> year<00:05:38.680> gave<00:05:38.979> us

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
worked out because the leap year gave us

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.640 
worked out because the leap year gave us
an<00:05:39.220> extra<00:05:39.310> day<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.780> off<00:05:40.990> chance<00:05:41.500> that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
an extra day for the off chance that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.270 
an extra day for the off chance that
we'd<00:05:42.010> screwed<00:05:42.370> up<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.580> numbers<00:05:42.910> so<00:05:43.660> day<00:05:44.560> 365

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
we'd screwed up the numbers so day 365

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.460 
we'd screwed up the numbers so day 365
of<00:05:45.340> vlogging<00:05:45.820> was<00:05:46.360> on<00:05:47.220> May<00:05:48.220> 15th<00:05:48.850> 2012<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:50.050> day

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
of vlogging was on May 15th 2012 so day

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.400 
of vlogging was on May 15th 2012 so day
one<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.710> year<00:05:50.950> to<00:05:51.220> set<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:51.940> off<00:05:52.060> on<00:05:52.090> May<00:05:52.360> 16th<00:05:52.870> so

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
one of year to set it off on May 16th so

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.980 
one of year to set it off on May 16th so
really<00:05:53.710> it<00:05:53.830> just<00:05:53.860> started<00:05:54.460> off<00:05:54.780> your<00:05:55.780> -

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
really it just started off your -

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.659 
really it just started off your -
started<00:05:56.350> off<00:05:56.470> as<00:05:56.620> if<00:05:56.770> there<00:05:56.919> was<00:05:57.010> no<00:05:57.220> leap<00:05:57.460> year

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
started off as if there was no leap year

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.760 
started off as if there was no leap year
so<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.270> actually<00:05:58.600> got<00:05:58.750> kind<00:05:59.200> of<00:05:59.320> lucked<00:05:59.560> out
