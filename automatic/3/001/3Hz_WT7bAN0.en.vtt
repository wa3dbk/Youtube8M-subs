everything right then part 3 came out
and<00:01:22.380> once<00:01:22.530> again<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> store<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.130> uncovered

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and once again the store was uncovered

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
and once again the store was uncovered
by<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> community<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.299> seems<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.049> was

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
by the community it seems that there was

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
by the community it seems that there was
nothing<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:25.619> hide<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.119> released

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
nothing I could hide but then I released

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
nothing I could hide but then I released
part<00:01:27.689> 4<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> somehow<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> single

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
part 4 and somehow no one not a single

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
part 4 and somehow no one not a single
person<00:01:30.329> found<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> pieces<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.619> story

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
person found the pieces the story

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649

remains<00:01:32.130> completely<00:01:32.369> hidden<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> guess<00:01:33.420> most

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
remains completely hidden I guess most

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
remains completely hidden I guess most
people<00:01:33.750> assume<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> filled<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> game

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
people assume that I filled the game

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
people assume that I filled the game
with<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> random<00:01:35.939> Easter<00:01:36.240> eggs<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
with a random Easter eggs this time I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
with a random Easter eggs this time I
didn't<00:01:37.619> what's<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> box<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> pieces

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
didn't what's in the box it's the pieces

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.030 
didn't what's in the box it's the pieces
put<00:01:39.420> together<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> bigger<00:01:40.590> question<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
put together but the bigger question is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
put together but the bigger question is
will<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.670> meet<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> community

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
will they meet with the community

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
will they meet with the community
accepted<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.009> fact<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.310> the

pieces<00:01:44.670> I've<00:01:44.790> been<00:01:44.880> remained<00:01:45.240> elusive<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
pieces I've been remained elusive this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
pieces I've been remained elusive this
time<00:01:46.140> strikes<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.950> incredible<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
time strikes me as incredible and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490 
time strikes me as incredible and
special<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.270> fitting<00:01:48.780> conclusion<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.320> some

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
ways and because of that I've decided

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
ways and because of that I've decided
some<00:01:51.479> maybe<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.110> things<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.380> best<00:01:52.530> left

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
game not find it to raise five so maybe

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.940 
game not find it to raise five so maybe
it<00:02:28.299> can<00:02:28.390> be<00:02:28.540> something<00:02:28.689> you<00:02:29.260> know<00:02:29.379> some<00:02:29.709> sort

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
it can be something you know some sort

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.819 
it can be something you know some sort
of<00:02:30.750> something<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.930> link<00:02:32.260> off<00:02:32.409> of<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
of something to link off of one of the

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.690 
of something to link off of one of the
other<00:02:32.950> game<00:02:33.129> something<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.549> we<00:02:33.640> don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
other game something like that we don't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.280 
other game something like that we don't
really<00:02:33.849> know<00:02:34.000> about<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:34.629> it'll<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
really know about that but it'll be a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.539 
really know about that but it'll be a
real<00:02:35.439> chance<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.829> have<00:02:35.950> even<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.250> small

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
real chance to have even a small

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.860 
real chance to have even a small
playable<00:02:36.879> portion<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.299> October<00:02:37.629> thirty-first

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
playable portion of October thirty-first

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.740 
playable portion of October thirty-first
so<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.680> might<00:02:38.859> get<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.069> demo<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.760> might<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:40.299> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
so we might get a demo we might not and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750 
so we might get a demo we might not and
then<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.200> course<00:02:41.260> he<00:02:41.920> basically<00:02:42.310> said<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.579> box

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
then of course he basically said the box

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
then of course he basically said the box
is<00:02:43.090> probably<00:02:43.870> never<00:02:44.079> going<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.319> be<00:02:44.409> open

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
is probably never going to be open

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.440 
is probably never going to be open
because<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.549> clues<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.970> what's<00:02:46.120> inside<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
because the clues to what's inside the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.819 
because the clues to what's inside the
