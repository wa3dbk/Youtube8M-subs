 Hey guys, what I said, Otto. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 Today I 'm here to bring a box to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.230
 You from the star to 50 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:25.369
 I bought in the western neighborhood that even in 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.369
 box theory here 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:47.940
 caught in the classic channel tradition already 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:58.160

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.920
 same time designers have 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:14.220
 I always make the mass packages here. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:19.939
 in really seeing it appears to be a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.939
 slightly greater than the 40 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.280
 volumes is now no longer an example 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.780

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.149
 downloading the software programs on the site 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.659

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.870
