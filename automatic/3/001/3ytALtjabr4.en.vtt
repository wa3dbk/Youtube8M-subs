so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.450> refill<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
so I like to think of this refill as the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
so I like to think of this refill as the
ultimate<00:01:07.530> sampling<00:01:08.159> source<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:09.210> without

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
ultimate sampling source just without

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
ultimate sampling source just without
the<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:09.960> legally<00:01:10.650> clearing<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the need for legally clearing the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.330 
the need for legally clearing the
samples<00:01:12.229> for<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> drum<00:01:13.500> parts<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.040> using

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
samples for the drum parts I'm using

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.969 
samples for the drum parts I'm using
some<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> individual<00:01:15.479> Rex<00:01:15.720> loops<00:01:15.990> this

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
some of the individual Rex loops this

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
some of the individual Rex loops this
beat<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> particular<00:01:17.580> comes<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
beat in particular comes from the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
beat in particular comes from the
Memphis<00:01:18.570> groove<00:01:19.110> 5<00:01:19.439> folder<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.670> did<00:01:20.880> some

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
Memphis groove 5 folder and I did some

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.880 
Memphis groove 5 folder and I did some
additional<00:01:21.210> processing<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.650> few

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
additional processing on it using a few

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
additional processing on it using a few
rack<00:01:23.100> extensions<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.030> ubq<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> some<00:01:25.140> others

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
rack extensions this ubq and some others

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.249 
rack extensions this ubq and some others
to<00:01:25.860> give<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> even<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.310> character<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> main

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
to give it even more character the main

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.080 
to give it even more character the main
bass<00:01:28.530> parts<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.040> using<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.460> loops<00:01:29.759> from

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
bass parts are using these loops from

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:39.390 
bass parts are using these loops from
the<00:01:30.180> Detroit<00:01:30.600> groove<00:01:30.960> 5<00:01:31.229> folder

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.910 

I<00:01:39.570> transpose<00:01:40.570> them<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.080> also<00:01:41.470> change<00:01:41.740> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
I transpose them and also change the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.370 
I transpose them and also change the
pitch<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.430> one<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.060> slices<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.110> was<00:01:44.230> in

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
pitch on one of the slices so it was in

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.920 
pitch on one of the slices so it was in
the<00:01:44.470> same<00:01:44.650> key<00:01:44.920> as<00:01:45.070> my<00:01:45.190> main<00:01:45.400> melody<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:46.000> wanted

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
the same key as my main melody I wanted

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.780 
the same key as my main melody I wanted
a<00:01:46.990> bass<00:01:47.170> sound<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.680> was<00:01:47.740> very<00:01:47.950> full<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.550> deep

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
a bass sound that was very full and deep

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.700 
a bass sound that was very full and deep
so<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.360> duplicated<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.170> device<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
so I duplicated the device and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.040 
so I duplicated the device and
transposed<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.520> down<00:01:51.730> one<00:01:52.030> octave<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.870> fill

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
transposed it down one octave to fill

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.950 
transposed it down one octave to fill
out<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.350> bottom<00:01:53.620> end

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.649 

I<00:01:59.340> also<00:02:00.340> found<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.760> really<00:02:00.970> great<00:02:01.090> bass<00:02:01.450> riff

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
I also found this really great bass riff

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.840 
I also found this really great bass riff
from<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.960> Detroit<00:02:02.320> groove<00:02:02.619> 7<00:02:03.010> folder<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
from the Detroit groove 7 folder and I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.850

wanted<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.210> use<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.570> but<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.409> felt<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.770> it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
wanted to use it but I felt like it

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.279 
wanted to use it but I felt like it
needed<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.400> bit<00:02:06.580> more<00:02:06.729> attitude<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.080> use

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
needed just a bit more attitude so I use

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.960 
needed just a bit more attitude so I use
the<00:02:08.440> echo<00:02:08.590> bode<00:02:08.890> for<00:02:09.160> some<00:02:09.280> gritty<00:02:09.520> pitchy
