just do not get down with quarterback
I'll<00:00:24.359> talk<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.320> second<00:00:25.769> but

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
I'll talk about that in one second but

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
I'll talk about that in one second but
our<00:00:26.490> big<00:00:26.820> changes<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.449> I've<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.960> Scott<00:00:28.260> at

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410

our big changes are I've got Scott at
running<00:00:28.650> back<00:00:28.680> instead<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.130> benjarvus

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
running back instead of benjarvus

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
running back instead of benjarvus
green-ellis<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.630> reason<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
green-ellis and the reason for that is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
green-ellis and the reason for that is
because<00:00:31.320> i'm<00:00:31.650> running<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> passing<00:00:32.520> scheme<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
because i'm running a passing scheme and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
because i'm running a passing scheme and
stop<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> pretty<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> heavy<00:00:35.370> passing

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
stop two is pretty much a heavy passing

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.650 
stop two is pretty much a heavy passing
scheme<00:00:36.300> um<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.850> drawers<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.480> dives

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
scheme um it with some drawers and dives

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.000 
scheme um it with some drawers and dives
and<00:00:39.930> stuff<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and stuff here and there but for the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
and stuff here and there but for the
most<00:00:41.070> part<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.030> passing<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
most part we're going to be passing and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.619 
most part we're going to be passing and
benjarvus<00:00:43.680> green-ellis<00:00:44.219> doesn't<00:00:45.210> catch<00:00:45.360> well

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
benjarvus green-ellis doesn't catch well

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.410 
benjarvus green-ellis doesn't catch well
Scott<00:00:46.530> catches<00:00:47.010> well<00:00:47.190> Scott's<00:00:47.579> faster<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
Scott catches well Scott's faster and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
Scott catches well Scott's faster and
benjarvus<00:00:48.930> green-ellis<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.649> slow<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
benjarvus green-ellis is slow so that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
benjarvus green-ellis is slow so that
combos<00:00:51.530> attributes<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> statistics

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
combos attributes and statistics

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
combos attributes and statistics
definitely<00:00:54.360> favors<00:00:54.809> Scott<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> why

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
definitely favors Scott which is why

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
definitely favors Scott which is why
he's<00:00:55.949> starting<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> know

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
he's starting one thing you want to know

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
he's starting one thing you want to know
is<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.680> teams<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.579> where

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is when you have teams like that where

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
is when you have teams like that where
you<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> saints<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you go with and it really just depends

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.620 
you go with and it really just depends
on<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.390> type<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> scheme<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.110> running<00:01:17.630> um

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
on what type of scheme you're running um

for<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> Packers<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.310> starting<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
for the Packers I'm starting to like the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810 
for the Packers I'm starting to like the
green<00:01:21.710> Alex<00:01:22.710> Green<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> believe<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> his<00:01:23.580> name

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.210 
green Alex Green I believe is his name
he's<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> decent<00:01:24.750> catching<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.590> he's<00:01:26.009> got

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
he's got a decent catching or he's got

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.700 
he's got a decent catching or he's got
the<00:01:26.340> best<00:01:26.490> catching<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> team<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.590> he's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the best catching on the team but he's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.600 
the best catching on the team but he's
also<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> decent<00:01:29.430> carry<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
also got a decent carry so you know with

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.230 
also got a decent carry so you know with
that<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> mind<00:01:32.970> he's<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.900> decent<00:01:34.350> overall

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
that in mind he's pretty decent overall

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.219 
that in mind he's pretty decent overall
depending<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.509> scheme<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:36.930> running

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.060 
no defense just tell them to work on
their<00:04:19.510> d<00:04:19.720> that's<00:04:19.959> all<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.440> say<00:04:20.590> about<00:04:20.620> that

yard<00:04:55.900> gains<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.470> 180<00:04:56.860> yard<00:04:57.160> run<00:04:57.430> just<00:04:57.700> kind<00:04:57.880> of

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
yard gains and 180 yard run just kind of

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.940 
yard gains and 180 yard run just kind of
ruined<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:58.450> average<00:04:58.840> or<00:04:59.080> was<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.890> a

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
ruined the average or was it a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.490 
ruined the average or was it a
consistent<00:05:00.640> 56<00:05:01.390> yards<00:05:01.840> because<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.230> can't

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
consistent 56 yards because you can't

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.710 
consistent 56 yards because you can't
allow<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.010> happen<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:04.060> just<00:05:04.450> have<00:05:04.600> to

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
allow that to happen so you just have to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.150 
allow that to happen so you just have to
understand<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.140> difference<00:05:05.530> there<00:05:05.740> as<00:05:05.890> well

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
understand the difference there as well

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.460 
understand the difference there as well
so<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:07.270> look<00:05:07.420> at<00:05:07.480> those<00:05:07.690> post<00:05:07.990> game<00:05:08.290> stats

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
so really look at those post game stats

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.110 
so really look at those post game stats
because<00:05:08.860> each<00:05:09.220> category<00:05:09.520> is<00:05:09.910> pretty

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
because each category is pretty

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.610 
because each category is pretty
important<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:12.090> like<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.600> make<00:05:14.380> sure<00:05:14.560> I

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
important and I like to just make sure I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.170 
important and I like to just make sure I
get<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.950> most<00:05:15.130> stops<00:05:15.400> possible<00:05:15.970> most

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
get the most stops possible most

so<00:05:35.260> it<00:05:35.890> really<00:05:36.520> just<00:05:36.820> depends<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.330> the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
so it really just depends on the

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.170 
so it really just depends on the
opponent<00:05:37.930> um<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.770> know<00:05:38.920> and<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:39.280> you'll<00:05:39.880> know

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
opponent um you know and you you'll know

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.090 
opponent um you know and you you'll know
that<00:05:40.450> just<00:05:40.750> from<00:05:40.870> playing<00:05:41.020> which<00:05:41.530> kind<00:05:41.980> of

that just from playing which kind of

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.200 
that just from playing which kind of
these<00:05:42.250> give<00:05:42.550> your<00:05:42.670> opponent<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.060> most

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
these give your opponent the most

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.600 
these give your opponent the most

quite<00:06:44.710> a<00:06:44.740> handy<00:06:45.220> skill<00:06:45.250> in<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.760> lot<00:06:45.910> of

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
quite a handy skill in a lot of

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.090 
quite a handy skill in a lot of
situations<00:06:46.350> right<00:06:47.350> here<00:06:47.410> we<00:06:47.710> get<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:47.890> late

much gonna wrap this game up still in
that<00:06:53.500> max<00:06:53.770> coverage<00:06:54.190> and<00:06:54.310> we<00:06:54.400> were<00:06:54.460> able<00:06:54.580> to

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
that max coverage and we were able to

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.220 
that max coverage and we were able to
capitalize<00:06:55.360> we<00:06:55.600> move<00:06:55.750> the<00:06:55.870> ball<00:06:56.050> pretty

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
capitalize we move the ball pretty

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.080 
capitalize we move the ball pretty
effectively<00:06:56.740> against<00:06:57.070> max<00:06:57.340> coverage<00:06:57.670> defense

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
effectively against max coverage defense

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.010 
effectively against max coverage defense
