00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
how Malia came about yeah howling or

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
how Malia came about yeah howling or
just<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.590> feet<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.309> coyote<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
just like like the feet of a coyote that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
just like like the feet of a coyote that
would<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.539> hear<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
would be hard to hear I think it was the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.549 
would be hard to hear I think it was the
howling<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.030> intuition<00:00:48.570> yeah<00:00:49.050> yeah

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
howling it was an intuition yeah yeah

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.420 
howling it was an intuition yeah yeah
maybe<00:00:50.070> he<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.180> intuitive<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.870> coyotes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
maybe he is very intuitive with coyotes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
maybe he is very intuitive with coyotes
I'm<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.789> sure<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.600> joining

the<00:01:25.049> same<00:01:25.259> level<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.100> couldn't<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> more

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the same level and I couldn't be more

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.600 
the same level and I couldn't be more
grateful<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.560> allows<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.979> such<00:01:29.250> amazing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and the makeup trailer on accident cuz

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.330 
and the makeup trailer on accident cuz
he<00:01:39.990> thought<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.470> Jill<00:01:40.680> Wagner<00:01:41.040> from<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
he thought I was Jill Wagner from the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 
he thought I was Jill Wagner from the
back<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> same<00:01:42.240> color<00:01:42.509> hair

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
back because we have the same color hair

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
back because we have the same color hair
and<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.189> very<00:01:44.880> embarrassed<00:01:45.210> about

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and so he was very embarrassed about

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
and so he was very embarrassed about
that<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.380> should<00:01:46.409> ask<00:01:46.740> him<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.549> him

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that you should ask him if you see him

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
that you should ask him if you see him
