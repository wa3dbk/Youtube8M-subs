things<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.640> past<00:00:05.850> quite<00:00:06.330> often<00:00:06.600> they<00:00:06.870> come

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
things in the past quite often they come

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.140 
things in the past quite often they come
in<00:00:07.200> kits<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.710> had<00:00:07.919> some<00:00:08.160> when<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.280> was<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.490> kid<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
in kits I had some when I was a kid and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.810 
in kits I had some when I was a kid and
they<00:00:10.080> never<00:00:10.230> lived<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> long<00:00:11.040> I've<00:00:11.580> always

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
they never lived that long I've always

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.580 
they never lived that long I've always
thought<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.150> were<00:00:12.240> cool<00:00:12.420> plants<00:00:12.960> but<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.500> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
thought they were cool plants but like I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.049 
thought they were cool plants but like I
said<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.830> haven't<00:00:14.009> had<00:00:14.219> them<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.490> years<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.910> had

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
said I haven't had them for years I had

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.430 
said I haven't had them for years I had
it<00:00:15.179> when<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> kid<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:15.990> never<00:00:16.170> lived

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it when I was a kid and they never lived

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920 
it when I was a kid and they never lived
that<00:00:16.590> long<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.609> figured<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.000> why<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.600> wanted

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that long and I figured out why I wanted

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.359 
that long and I figured out why I wanted
to<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.140> another<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:19.890> I've<00:00:19.949> done<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.340> of

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
to get another one so I've done a lot of

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.480 
to get another one so I've done a lot of
research<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.480> basically<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:23.189> kits

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
research on them and basically the kits

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
research on them and basically the kits
that<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.939> used<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.720> stuff<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that I used to get and stuff and how I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.230 
that I used to get and stuff and how I
used<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> care<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.640> basically<00:00:27.000> all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
used to care for them was basically all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.189 
used to care for them was basically all
wrong

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
wrong

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
wrong
first<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.920> lots<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> kits<00:00:29.699> come<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
first off lots of the kits come with a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.959 
first off lots of the kits come with a
dome<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.859> they<00:00:31.859> kind<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.130> keep<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.489> humidity

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
dome and they kind of keep in humidity

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
dome and they kind of keep in humidity
you<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you don't want to do that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
you don't want to do that
that'll<00:00:35.610> pretty<00:00:35.790> much<00:00:35.880> cause<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that'll pretty much cause them not to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.959 
that'll pretty much cause them not to
live<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.290> long<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.649> don't<00:00:37.860> want<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> dome<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
live very long you don't want a dome you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.610 
live very long you don't want a dome you
need<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.300> lighting<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.170> something<00:00:40.410> I

provides<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> same<00:03:18.739> idea<00:03:19.100> always<00:03:19.459> keep<00:03:19.610> it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
provides the same idea always keep it

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.280 
provides the same idea always keep it
moist<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.360> doesn't<00:03:20.690> work<00:03:20.840> these<00:03:21.110> guys

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
moist but that doesn't work these guys

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.470 
moist but that doesn't work these guys
don't<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.739> be<00:03:21.980> super<00:03:22.430> humid<00:03:22.820> they<00:03:23.299> like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
don't like to be super humid they like

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.650 
don't like to be super humid they like
to<00:03:23.600> have<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.750> moist<00:03:23.989> substrate<00:03:24.560> though<00:03:25.660> so

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
to have a moist substrate though so

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.449 
to have a moist substrate though so
basically<00:03:27.079> that's<00:03:27.320> about<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:28.010> for<00:03:28.250> how<00:03:28.400> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
basically that's about it for how to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.600 
basically that's about it for how to
care<00:03:28.760> from<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.180> then<00:03:29.329> there's<00:03:29.540> feeding

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
care from but then there's feeding

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.729 
care from but then there's feeding
feeding<00:03:31.750> basically<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> also<00:03:33.049> did<00:03:33.320> wrong<00:03:33.530> as<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
feeding basically I also did wrong as a

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.170 
feeding basically I also did wrong as a
kid<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.250> was<00:03:34.370> always<00:03:34.760> messing<00:03:35.150> with

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
kid because I was always messing with

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.270 
kid because I was always messing with
the<00:03:35.390> plant<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:35.959> was<00:03:36.470> always<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.860> know<00:03:36.920> trying

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
the plant I was always you know trying

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.770 
the plant I was always you know trying
to<00:03:37.340> get<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.519> deep<00:03:37.760> bugs<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.360> probably

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
to get a deep bugs and that probably

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.660 
to get a deep bugs and that probably
just<00:03:39.260> stressed<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.739> out<00:03:39.829> anyways<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.400> caused

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
just stressed it out anyways and caused

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.120 
just stressed it out anyways and caused
it<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.970> die<00:03:41.120> as<00:03:41.180> well<00:03:41.540> these<00:03:42.380> plants<00:03:42.739> only<00:03:42.860> need

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
it to die as well these plants only need

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.550 
it to die as well these plants only need
about<00:03:43.250> one<00:03:43.579> insect<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.090> week<00:03:44.269> if<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.290> them

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
about one insect a week if you have them

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.830 
about one insect a week if you have them
inside<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.130> can<00:03:46.250> feed<00:03:46.459> them<00:03:46.579> any<00:03:47.420> type<00:03:47.690> of

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
inside you can feed them any type of

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.630 
inside you can feed them any type of
insect<00:03:48.230> basically<00:03:48.709> I'll<00:03:49.010> get<00:03:49.220> some<00:03:49.400> feeding

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
insect basically I'll get some feeding

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.370 
insect basically I'll get some feeding
videos<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.209> future<00:03:50.570> but<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.989> planted

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
videos in the future but I just planted

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.259 
videos in the future but I just planted
this<00:03:51.500> guy<00:03:51.680> today<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.579> should<00:03:52.760> wait<00:03:52.940> at<00:03:53.090> least

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
this guy today and should wait at least

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.990 
this guy today and should wait at least
three<00:03:53.570> or<00:03:53.720> four<00:03:53.750> days<00:03:54.130> after<00:03:55.130> planning<00:03:55.880> to

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
three or four days after planning to

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.699 
three or four days after planning to
feed<00:03:56.239> them<00:03:56.420> because<00:03:56.540> they<00:03:56.870> still<00:03:57.410> got<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.560> make

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
feed them because they still got to make

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.310 
feed them because they still got to make
their<00:03:57.890> roots<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.280> get<00:03:58.370> ready<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:59.200> fully<00:04:00.200> open

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
their roots and get ready and fully open

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.949 
their roots and get ready and fully open
up<00:04:00.680> too<00:04:00.920> as<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.280> see<00:04:01.489> there<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.840> how

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
up too as you can see there this is how

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.830 
up too as you can see there this is how
they<00:04:03.109> came<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.530> me<00:04:03.650> they<00:04:04.220> still<00:04:04.519> have<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.970> fully

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
they came to me they still have to fully

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.099 
they came to me they still have to fully
open<00:04:05.959> up<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:08.150> basically<00:04:08.299> they<00:04:08.750> should<00:04:09.019> eat

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
open up so basically they should eat

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.129 
open up so basically they should eat
about<00:04:09.350> one<00:04:09.560> insect<00:04:09.980> per<00:04:10.280> week<00:04:10.660> per<00:04:11.660> plant<00:04:11.959> I

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
about one insect per week per plant I

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.840 
about one insect per week per plant I
actually<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.530> two<00:04:12.709> plants<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.190> here<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.609> two

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
actually have two plants in here to two

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.250 
actually have two plants in here to two
different<00:04:14.199> there's<00:04:15.199> a<00:04:15.290> lot<00:04:15.440> of<00:04:15.590> tops<00:04:15.829> but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
different there's a lot of tops but

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.900 
different there's a lot of tops but
two<00:04:16.560> different<00:04:16.710> plants<00:04:17.100> spread<00:04:17.490> out<00:04:17.670> so<00:04:17.880> I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
two different plants spread out so I

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.280 
two different plants spread out so I
actually<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.240> two<00:04:18.390> plants<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:19.050> so<00:04:19.230> I

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
actually have two plants in here so I

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.560 
actually have two plants in here so I
could<00:04:19.440> feed<00:04:19.650> two<00:04:19.890> insects<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.430> week<00:04:20.610> when<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.360> was

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
could feed two insects a week when I was

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.840 
could feed two insects a week when I was
a<00:04:21.600> kid<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.870> used<00:04:21.990> to<00:04:22.200> try<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> know<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:23.310> often<00:04:23.700> as

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
a kid I used to try you know as often as

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.000 
a kid I used to try you know as often as
I<00:04:23.940> could<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.420> all<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.260> tops<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.680> always<00:04:25.800> be

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
I could and all the tops would always be

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.500 
I could and all the tops would always be
closed<00:04:26.310> sometimes<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.000> good<00:04:27.150> insects

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
closed sometimes the good insects

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.360 
closed sometimes the good insects
sometimes<00:04:27.900> they<00:04:28.020> wouldn't<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:28.980> was<00:04:29.130> trying

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
sometimes they wouldn't so I was trying

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.160 
sometimes they wouldn't so I was trying
to<00:04:29.430> feed<00:04:29.610> them<00:04:29.730> too<00:04:29.910> much<00:04:30.060> back<00:04:30.360> then<00:04:30.600> as<00:04:30.720> well

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
to feed them too much back then as well

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.130 
to feed them too much back then as well
so<00:04:31.980> pretty<00:04:32.970> much<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.270> wanted<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.540> talk<00:04:33.750> about<00:04:33.780> it

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
so pretty much I wanted to talk about it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.780 
so pretty much I wanted to talk about it
like<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.530> said<00:04:34.710> these<00:04:34.950> are<00:04:35.010> pretty<00:04:35.280> common<00:04:35.550> you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
like I said these are pretty common you

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.100 
like I said these are pretty common you
can<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.030> kits<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.480> them<00:04:36.630> all<00:04:36.750> over<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> place

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
can get kits for them all over the place

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.350 
can get kits for them all over the place
I'd<00:04:37.950> say<00:04:38.190> go<00:04:38.340> online<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.850> try<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.060> find

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
I'd say go online and try to find

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.060 
I'd say go online and try to find
reviews<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.990> buy<00:04:40.080> from<00:04:40.320> somewhere<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.770> has

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
reviews and buy from somewhere that has

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.980 
reviews and buy from somewhere that has
good<00:04:41.400> plants<00:04:41.850> they're<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> better<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.750> pretty

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
good plants they're a better of a pretty

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.950 
good plants they're a better of a pretty
good<00:04:43.140> size<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:44.190> was<00:04:44.400> about<00:04:44.550> $12<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.810> two

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
good size this was about $12 for two

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.650 
good size this was about $12 for two
plants<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:47.310> pretty<00:04:47.790> good<00:04:47.970> size<00:04:48.180> for

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
plants and it's pretty good size for

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.080 
plants and it's pretty good size for
that<00:04:48.780> cost<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.650> we'll<00:04:50.430> see<00:04:50.580> how<00:04:50.760> long<00:04:50.790> it

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
that cost and we'll see how long it

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.080
