pulled in the middle there it's a very

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.509 
pulled in the middle there it's a very
effective<00:03:39.080> thing<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.739> kobliner<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
effective thing and kobliner is the

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.550 
effective thing and kobliner is the
moment<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:40.910> -<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.959> know<00:03:42.080> I'm<00:03:42.200> here<00:03:42.410> tonight
