here if you can figure it you have
another<00:03:44.270> monitor<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:44.989> actually<00:03:45.140> have<00:03:45.410> it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
another monitor you can actually have it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.979 
another monitor you can actually have it
on<00:03:45.620> top<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.820> will<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.450> display<00:03:47.840> and

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
and stuff like that but still they're

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.390 
and stuff like that but still they're
great<00:04:26.630> games<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:31.010> difference

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
great games to have the difference

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.189 
great games to have the difference
between<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.090> future<00:04:32.510> pinball<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:33.080> a

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
between this and future pinball is a

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.920 
between this and future pinball is a
feature<00:04:33.380> pinball<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:34.250> completely<00:04:34.940> free

feature pinball is completely free
legally<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.620> guess<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.880> problems<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.690> won't

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
legally I guess the problems you won't

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.969 
legally I guess the problems you won't
have<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.080> worry<00:04:39.229> about<00:04:39.410> downloading<00:04:39.590> them

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
have to worry about downloading them

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.439 
have to worry about downloading them
because<00:04:40.220> they're<00:04:40.340> all<00:04:40.460> free<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:41.000> people<00:04:41.120> make

because they're all free and people make

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.990 
because they're all free and people make
them<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.770> they're<00:04:43.400> honestly<00:04:43.729> ROM

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
them this one they're honestly ROM

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.430 
them this one they're honestly ROM
tables<00:04:44.449> these<00:04:44.660> are<00:04:44.840> actually<00:04:45.110> true

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
tables these are actually true

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.770

dedications that people build based on
the<00:04:47.870> rocks<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:50.210> might<00:04:51.199> have<00:04:51.289> a<00:04:51.350> little

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
the rocks so you might have a little

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.090 
the rocks so you might have a little
trouble<00:04:51.620> finding<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.690> emulator<00:04:54.110> itself<00:04:54.470> just

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
trouble finding the emulator itself just

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.730 
trouble finding the emulator itself just
like<00:04:55.130> all<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.460> emulators<00:04:56.410> so<00:04:57.410> that's<00:04:57.590> this

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
like all the emulators so that's this

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.140 
like all the emulators so that's this
one<00:04:57.949> at<00:04:58.100> South<00:04:58.340> Park<00:05:00.370> obviously<00:05:01.370> actually<00:05:02.000> no

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
one at South Park obviously actually no

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.370 
one at South Park obviously actually no
that<00:05:02.419> was<00:05:02.539> since<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.960> let<00:05:03.080> me<00:05:03.110> assure<00:05:03.229> you
