00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280 
you see they use the bottom you could
use<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.730> side<00:01:30.970> right<00:01:31.240> here<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:32.080> could<00:01:32.260> use

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
you

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.570 
you
I<00:01:35.080> usually<00:01:35.350> use<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.800> bottom<00:01:36.100> because<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.490> just

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
I usually use the bottom because it just

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.280 
I usually use the bottom because it just
gives<00:01:36.760> me<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.060> best<00:01:37.270> result

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.080 

the<00:01:42.290> thing<00:01:42.500> about<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.830> Beautyblender<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.729> you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the thing about the Beautyblender is you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.899 
the thing about the Beautyblender is you
can<00:01:44.299> layer<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.830> for<00:01:45.830> as<00:01:45.920> much<00:01:46.159> coverage<00:01:46.490> as<00:01:46.850> you

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
can layer it for as much coverage as you

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.530 
can layer it for as much coverage as you
need<00:01:47.740> without<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.070> looking<00:01:49.220> cakey<00:01:49.880> because<00:01:50.390> it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
need without it looking cakey because it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
need without it looking cakey because it
is<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.750> little<00:01:51.200> bit<00:01:51.320> damp<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:51.860> does<00:01:52.100> share<00:01:52.430> out

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
is a little bit damp so does share out

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.170 
is a little bit damp so does share out
the<00:01:52.729> coverage<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.450> little<00:01:53.690> bit<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the coverage just a little bit so the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.060 
the coverage just a little bit so the
estee<00:01:56.540> lauder<00:01:56.690> double<00:01:56.840> wear<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.619> heavy

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
estee lauder double wear is a heavy

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.130 
estee lauder double wear is a heavy
coverage<00:01:58.610> foundation<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:01:59.720> already<00:01:59.960> time

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
coverage foundation and I'm already time

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.600 
coverage foundation and I'm already time
sharing<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.649> out<00:02:00.770> with<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.190> Mac<00:02:01.369> face<00:02:01.550> and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
sharing it out with the Mac face and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.570 
sharing it out with the Mac face and
body<00:02:02.500> but<00:02:04.149> even<00:02:05.149> having<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.840> bit

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
body but even having that little bit

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.860 
body but even having that little bit
mixed<00:02:07.580> in<00:02:08.440> gives<00:02:09.440> me<00:02:10.180> maximum<00:02:11.180> coverage<00:02:13.870> okay

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
mixed in gives me maximum coverage okay

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.600 
mixed in gives me maximum coverage okay
so<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:15.769> do<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.190> some<00:02:16.760> still<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.209> my<00:02:17.330> hand<00:02:17.690> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so I do have some still in my hand and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so I do have some still in my hand and
what<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:19.700> gonna<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.209> going<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.360> pounce

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pounce

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.460 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pounce
it<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:22.300> then<00:02:23.300> place<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.660> where<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.230> need<00:02:24.320> more

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
it and then place it where I need more

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.809 
it and then place it where I need more
coverage

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.820 

you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.690 

so<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.850> was<00:02:40.210> my<00:02:40.480> first<00:02:40.870> layer<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> actually

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
so this was my first layer so I actually

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.400 
so this was my first layer so I actually
think<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.570> looks<00:02:43.810> pretty<00:02:44.110> good<00:02:46.320> just<00:02:47.320> a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
think that this looks pretty good just a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.770 
think that this looks pretty good just a
little<00:02:47.440> bit<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.610> Bobby<00:02:49.420> Brown

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
little bit this is the Bobby Brown

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.170 
little bit this is the Bobby Brown
corrector<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.950> bisque

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
corrector in bisque

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.520 
corrector in bisque
I<00:02:52.440> put<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.560> corrector<00:02:54.070> on<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.520> my<00:02:54.640> finger

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
I put the corrector on with my finger

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.040 
I put the corrector on with my finger
but<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.710> do<00:02:56.770> put<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.400> concealer<00:02:57.670> on<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:01.210> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
but I do put my concealer on with the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.770 
but I do put my concealer on with the
Beauty<00:03:02.410> Blender<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:07.000> what<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.240> corrector

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
and I'm just gonna start pouncing and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.600 
and I'm just gonna start pouncing and
then<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.140> does<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.800> blends<00:04:39.100> in<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
then what that does is it blends in the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.490 
then what that does is it blends in the
pin<00:04:39.790> sealer<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.750> has<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.930> little<00:04:44.169> bit<00:04:44.410> of

pin sealer and it has a little bit of
that<00:04:44.620> dampness<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:46.960> kind<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.229> sheers<00:04:47.590> it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
that dampness so so it kind of sheers it

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.280 
that dampness so so it kind of sheers it
out<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.950> little<00:04:48.190> bit

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.240 
you the corner to go around the nose
area<00:04:57.410> I'm<00:04:58.410> going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.680> kind<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.920> just<00:04:59.100> press

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
area I'm going to kind of just press

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.610 
area I'm going to kind of just press
with<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.700> side<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.810> go<00:05:01.020> onto<00:05:01.290> my<00:05:01.320> nose

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
with the side just to go onto my nose

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.500 
with the side just to go onto my nose
but<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.310> don't<00:05:02.460> want<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.670> do<00:05:02.760> wiping<00:05:03.150> motions

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
but you don't want to do wiping motions

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.700 
but you don't want to do wiping motions
because<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.840> will<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.020> move<00:05:04.350> around<00:05:04.470> the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
because it will just move around the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.070 
because it will just move around the
foundation

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.779 

so<00:05:12.560> when<00:05:12.710> I'm<00:05:12.830> doing<00:05:12.949> this<00:05:13.220> I'm<00:05:13.490> kind<00:05:13.729> of

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
so when I'm doing this I'm kind of
