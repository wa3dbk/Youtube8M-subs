00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.840
 when it's really the big cat's 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.630
 rare climbs as low it is rarely 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.250

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.369
 players made teams that bug 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 and every time we kick it soccer 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.340
 this is hopeless hopeless 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.649
 the money that are made on fifa points 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.319

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.759
 put servers on top of that bug in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.649

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.270
 bug once a day a stop time 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.319
