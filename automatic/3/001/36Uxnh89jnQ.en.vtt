00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome her dear 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.030
 here to a small extra following stars 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.340
 table yes you see fabi is too 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 while hello ball deal is in fact 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.350
 today you also see we are in the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.930
 cold and fabi has now finally got his 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 Rest and would like to be for today 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 the buy and we thought that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.949
 We also take because that is for 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.520
 adidas is something special 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:40.649
 gray is already on again 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 my call on it looks but also 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 that's the unusual thing 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.860
 Standard color can be said on the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.530
 most common for those are in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.800
 I have that real too, then I take 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.800
 not you 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.390
 the brown ads I already have a while 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.560
 with me you get even if 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.140
 you still a woman who becomes hollow 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.860
 probably that he is the white one 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 instrument it is probably the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.490
 next 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.380
 the names right at the beginning that's it 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.640
 is not that bad I had 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.810
 there already worse in there 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.090
 was poppe I had the same times in there ties 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.070
 tiessen is the peace road or yes 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.410
 but it sounds very stupid 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.770
 I say I can not 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.770
 decide 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.460
 they exist 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.060
 Just make a cut here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.440
 and then we see you in myself at 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.490
 ask me where I then the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.820
 wants to reveal names 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.310
 Okay, we'll do it that way, we'll see each other 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 I'll be back soon 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.160
 at steve hamm and are already waiting 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 come out on the fabi 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.380
 that is yes and he has a long time 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.489
 lying quantity taken 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.750
 Exactly I did not want to be quite cool 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.360
 a little bit of the other four and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.420
 And that's cool, too 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.970
 we dug a bit alongside others 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.280
 the idea so it's actually it 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.720
 something completely different hardly anyone rides with 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 this amount of rum I have with the brown 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.519
 for example , someone with the crowd 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.519
 seen 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.989
 Personally, I find it too 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100
 not getting used to im not im 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.170
 negative sense 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.680
 everything is just like I said you can see it 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.209
 so rare but i find it cool i like 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.819
 me as I stand then I have to 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.650
 say and I think that 's something 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.569
 you know it is very pretty from that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.060
 This is something westerns westerns 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.599
 the quarters came together 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.599
 white 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:17.250
 Bandagen exactly that is just that 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.560
 Western asset and these white wraps 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 gaiters exactly the white wraps 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.100

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.000
