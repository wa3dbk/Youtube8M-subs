and out of the tent and the door itself

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.930 
and out of the tent and the door itself
when<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.860> used<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.280> goes<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> little

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
when not used just goes in a little

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.040 
when not used just goes in a little
stuff<00:02:15.150> pocket<00:02:15.510> down<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> side<00:02:16.350> here

stuff pocket down the side here

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.090 
stuff pocket down the side here
so<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> outside<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.800> tent<00:02:19.980> we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
so you're on the outside of the tent we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.230 
so you're on the outside of the tent we
can<00:02:20.220> take<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> look<00:02:20.550> at<00:02:20.610> some<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.880> external

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
can take a look at some of the external

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.170 
can take a look at some of the external
features<00:02:21.710> we<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:22.860> flat<00:02:23.190> pole<00:02:23.820> sleeves

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
features we have flat pole sleeves

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
features we have flat pole sleeves
benefit<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.560> allows<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.070> wind

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
benefit of this it just allows the wind

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.040 
benefit of this it just allows the wind
just<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.060> over<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> top<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> tent<00:02:27.900> nice

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
just to go over the top of the tent nice

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.050 
just to go over the top of the tent nice
and<00:02:28.260> easily<00:02:28.380> prevents<00:02:28.890> any<00:02:29.010> extra<00:02:29.580> turbulence

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and easily prevents any extra turbulence

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.900 
and easily prevents any extra turbulence
inside<00:02:30.270> makes<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> more<00:02:30.930> comfortable

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
inside makes it more comfortable

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.520 
inside makes it more comfortable
reflective<00:02:32.910> tabs<00:02:33.240> dotted<00:02:34.020> around<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> tent

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
reflective tabs dotted around the tent

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
reflective tabs dotted around the tent
itself<00:02:34.890> makes<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:35.310> visible<00:02:35.490> at<00:02:35.820> night

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
itself makes it more visible at night

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.350 
itself makes it more visible at night
and<00:02:36.960> then<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.440> those<00:02:38.360> external

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and then here we have those external

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
and then here we have those external
vents<00:02:39.900> these<00:02:40.200> ones<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.590> lead<00:02:40.710> into<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
vents these ones that lead into the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.760 
vents these ones that lead into the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
inside of the sleeping area itself these

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.440 
inside of the sleeping area itself these
vents<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.580> maximize<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.090> amount<00:02:45.270> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
vents just really maximize the amount of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.480 
vents just really maximize the amount of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
going to take a look at the 300 so here

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.180 
going to take a look at the 300 so here
we<00:02:53.520> are<00:02:53.550> inside<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.030> Huracan<00:02:54.390> 300<00:02:55.190> exactly

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
we are inside the Huracan 300 exactly

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.830 
we are inside the Huracan 300 exactly
the<00:02:56.280> same<00:02:56.430> features<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> 200<00:02:57.720> but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the same features as the 200 but

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.290 
the same features as the 200 but
obviously<00:02:58.110> slightly<00:02:58.980> larger<00:02:59.460> designed<00:03:00.210> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
sleep up to 3 people you should probably

sleep up to 3 people you should probably

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
fit in here but ideally probably want to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.840 
fit in here but ideally probably want to

share it between the two of you give

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.480 
share it between the two of you give
yourself<00:03:06.150> an<00:03:06.240> extra<00:03:06.420> bit<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.660> space<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.400> we

yourself an extra bit of space so as we
