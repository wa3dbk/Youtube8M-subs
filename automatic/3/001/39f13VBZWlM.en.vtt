00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.600
 It is the way to go to create a sharp Bob Hayama 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:26.009
 It's a provisional ass when going to set the length, but 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.550
 It also serves as that you do not slide the sister of the balding of this natural state by connecting back with your fingers 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.550
 To go 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.370
 Why me 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 I will make it with sharp lines 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.980
 I'm sorry 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.980
 I will make a line a little before the fall 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 When would you shape the Tabataba when you have this 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.240
 In a natural way because accidentally get a book quite 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 so as not to break the shape of the path bar Beku n 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.780
 Will increase 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 It is difficult to describe 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 Also I'd say even taking 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 Than a little becomes easier feather 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 Twist to break this shape 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.890
 Now Cape when the two death is careful not to enter 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 If you raise the stem too much and buy the right and left landmarks , the waiter is on the downside 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.120
 This aspect before falling 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.340
 I will connect 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.300
 Then you look like Yonekura Ryoko 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.480
 Bob down the front is good 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.990
 I can make it to my brother 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.490
 Now it's in a state of hunting for hunting 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 In s tour 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.600
 Prepare 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.610
 The system is on the downside 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.909
 Even scissor is fine, but it may become shorter if it is suddenly cut, so now it is tinning 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.909
 Adjusted with
