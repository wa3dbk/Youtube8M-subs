00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.780
 O 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.460
 was the first one can tell here the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.110
 first 20 seconds have slept there 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.950
 we were lucky 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.470
 or tried to appear differently was 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.580
 kept outstanding 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.410
 I think the first houses have 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.210
 balanced game we had seen 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 our chances in the first half 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 and the unused and tried that 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.370
 to design a game 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.699
 to play ball possession and to be patient 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.409
 this is what we think is so 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.760
 shortly after the game was not so successful 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.769
 as we intended 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.729
 in the first half in the second 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:03.040
 half time I think we can our team 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.650
 the chances we did not have 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.299
 were used and we have to continue 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.690
 certain processes are patient 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.719
 train and these processes we 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.450
 that from my point of view the pleasing 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.659
 We practice in training also in the game 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 We are others in the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.649
 second half succeeded 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.509
 and then we too will 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.409
 scored again and will also be in 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.290
 games will go and win leadership 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:44.750
 I am very confident 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 because our team shows a lot in the game 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.620
 what we work under in the training and 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.500
 that is gratifying to me today too 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.960
 played zero 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.130
 a point taken away 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.890
 and now it's time again 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.400
 be kaiserlautern you tomorrow in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.500
 rest together with the team 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.500
 A few things to discuss and us 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.140
 focus on the next game 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 Thanks a lot to yours 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.870
 Comment on the game with the first 16 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.620
 seconds were of course with 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 one hundred percent safety 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.780
 agree except for the fact that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.770
 The final was the shot of 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.070
 was excellent and not 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.850
 led to the Tor volk 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.120
 otherwise we have the forward movement 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.850
 partly second in the first half 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.100
 too many possibilities 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.550
 the clear pass game lie forward 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.950
 to let 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.420
 conditioned by the fact that the error rate in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.400
 the last final staff easy too 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.130
 big was clear ball possession was 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.200
 but it comes but yes 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.440
 what I have to underline it is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.330
 nevertheless with this point profit 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.799
 Of course we were more satisfied 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
 your bark against one of the 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.870
 Aufforsfavoriten marriage in your own 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.600
 Stadion 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.980
 the turn wanted to initiate a big one 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.830
 step back in the direction 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.580
 Let's start the season 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.739
 have taken 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.510
 Unfortunately, we only have that lag of course 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.920
 also a strength from chrysler and one 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.810
 made a small step but at least 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.630
 we are played to zero we have 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 despite the partially massive 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.830
 Ball possession superiority 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 Chancellors give us clear chances 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.030
 We fought it out 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.600
 unfortunately not done but that is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.950
 just the reason for our situation 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.000
 self-confidence 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.739
 understandably after four play in 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.130
 the result that we did not lose like that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.220
 great as you want that to be 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.269
 To return with a sense of achievement 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.459
 demand to catch up again 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.720
 I am absolutely convinced of that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.920
 that's what we do with our team 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.630
 to experience 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.519
 the motivation i 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.640
 We have ordered that too 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.410
 100 percent seen 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.260
 and the performance of the effective 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.660
 performance if we continue to cost 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.730
 just like you still work 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.880
 I'm looking forward to the game in cottbus 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.940
 will have the next week as yes 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.910
 Some time ago there was a small one too 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.410
 or, where a large turn even 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.110
 direction of positive affairs 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.370
 born before and in that sense when we 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.650
 tackle this week if we look 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 then prepare in cottbus the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.230
 next hopefully bigger step 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.299
 do 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.299
 in the right direction thank you
