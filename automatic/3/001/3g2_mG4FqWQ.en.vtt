&lt;p&gt;Steve: Hi.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm Steve Matthes, Transworld Motocross' Editor
at Large, and this week on the "Transworld

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.029
Motocross How To," presented by BikeBandit,
we're going to show you how to adjust your

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.489
sag with this cool Motion Pro Sag Adjuster.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250
Sag on a motorcycle is very, very important.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.989
I can't stress enough that when you get the
brand new motorcycle if you've never done

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.420
your sag, you need to check it.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
It helps your rear suspension, and your front
for that matter, work properly in each and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.940
every condition.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.109
This way too you'll also know if your spring
rate on the rear, suits your weight.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:58.510
So if I can recommend anything to anybody,
it's adjust your forks for the right height

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.510
and adjust your sag.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.000
Very, very important and I will show you how
this week.&lt;/p&gt;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.460
&lt;p&gt;All right, I've got my sweet Motion Pro
Sag Tool and I've got a Sharpie marker.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.640
So what you want to do is put this in the
hole of the axle.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.360
Find a spot on your fender that's pretty much
a straight line, adjust it accordingly, and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.619
find zero.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.789
So there we found zero right there, tighten
this back up on the bottom and just for sanity's

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.990
sake, put a little mark there so you know
you're at zero.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.200
And that's your base while the bike is on
the stand with no weight on it.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.270
All right, so for this, we've got the Photo
Editor of TransWorld Motocross, Brandon Lutes

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
[SP], Lutes come on in.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.450
What size [inaudible 00:01:47] do you think
I would need for this to adjust properly?&lt;/p&gt;

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.420
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: What's the biggest size?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: They make like a 5.8, 6.0.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.550
Anyways, get on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: I don't know what mine...I don't

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.260
know what's in it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: Okay.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.810
So what we've got is we already know we're
at zero, I highly suggest that you and your

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.750
buddy get together to do your sag.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450
Dress up in your gear because your gear adds
10 to 15 pounds to your weight with boots

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.950
and a helmet and everything.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.319
So to get precisely accurate, dress up in
your gear, get your buddy to help you.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.819
So we're at zero, we know we're at zero on
our mark.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.220
Lutes is at neutral...stay neutral on the
bike, don't shift back and forth, basically,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.359
sit where you would sit to ride the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: Do you want to keep your feet

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.560
in front of the footpegs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: It doesn't really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: It doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.519
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: All right, so what we have here

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:50.519
with Lutes on it, we're going to mark it back
up to our mark and we are at 1.08.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.290
So from zero to 1.08 milimeters on our scale.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.890
So what we want, we want 105 for Lutes, for
his speed and for his suspension settings,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.359
so let's go to 105.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.650
I recommend a punch, here at the palatial
TransWorld offices, no punch was available

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.840
so we're using a big screwdriver, but you
can use one, too.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.880
Basically get in there, break the lock ring
loose, give yourself a few threads, and now

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.700
you're ready for adjustment.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.510
Now we're at 108, we want 105, so what we
want to do is we want to go less.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.400
So we want to turn the spring, we want to
tighten the spring down in a clockwise position

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.120
to get less sag.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.150
If you need more, you back it off.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.530
So just reach in there, one complete turn
and you could put a magic marker in there

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.080
or just eyeball.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.230
One complete turn is about 4 millimeters.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.180
That's a good guideline to know how many turns
to go.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.549
I went almost one turn all around.

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.620
Now, let's remeasure.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.530
All right, we've got Lutes back on and as
you can see instead of 105, I'm actually at

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:12.790
102 right now, so I need to give him a little
bit more sag.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.670
And as you can see right now, we're at 105,
so we're perfect for where he wants to go.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.710
And the bike will handle like a dream, it
will handle the bumps better, and like I recommend,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.320
adjusting the sag is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that has been this week's "TransWorld

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.470
Motorcross How To," presented by BikeBandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust that sag. &lt;/p&gt;
