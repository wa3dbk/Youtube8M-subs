think is pretty pertinent that are

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.299 
think is pretty pertinent that are
pretty<00:00:11.759> curtain<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.559> it's<00:00:13.559> educating<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
pretty curtain and it's educating the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
pretty curtain and it's educating the
people<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.730> muscular<00:00:15.150> dystrophy<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
people to muscular dystrophy this is a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.930 
people to muscular dystrophy this is a
disease<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.550> three<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.910> half

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
disease that about three and a half

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.200 
disease that about three and a half
years<00:00:18.240> ago<00:00:18.300> very<00:00:18.630> few<00:00:18.840> people<00:00:19.140> knew<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
years ago very few people knew about I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.580 
years ago very few people knew about I
suppose<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.779> lack<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:21.990> funds<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
suppose because of lack of funds and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
suppose because of lack of funds and
there<00:00:22.680> was<00:00:22.769> no<00:00:22.970> possible<00:00:23.970> chance<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.539> them

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there was no possible chance of them

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.170 
there was no possible chance of them

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they could take the disease and wipe it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.960 
they could take the disease and wipe it
off<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> face<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> earth<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> matter<00:01:14.670> of

off the face of the earth in a matter of
three<00:01:15.840> months<00:01:16.170> times<00:01:16.759> that's<00:01:17.759> pretty

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
three months times that's pretty

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.870 
three months times that's pretty
frightening<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.320> true<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.340> reason<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

that so that you understand is so that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
that so that you understand is so that
they<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.799> take<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.189> nine<00:01:23.369> million<00:01:23.610> dollars

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
they can take the nine million dollars

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
they can take the nine million dollars
and<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.900> radium<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.369> work<00:01:26.580> in
