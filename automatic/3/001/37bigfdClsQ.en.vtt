will see that there is the heating
source<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:32.570> top<00:01:32.950> which<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.100> where<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
source and the top which is where the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.600 
source and the top which is where the
coffee<00:01:34.550> beans<00:01:34.850> go<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:36.410> goes<00:01:36.590> right<00:01:37.010> in<00:01:37.310> like

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
coffee beans go it goes right in like

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.990 
coffee beans go it goes right in like
that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.940 
that
and<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:39.170> lock<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:41.050> there<00:01:42.050> now<00:01:42.410> it's<00:01:42.590> locked

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
and you lock it there now it's locked

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.090 
and you lock it there now it's locked
and<00:01:43.400> then<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.210> top<00:01:44.480> goes<00:01:44.750> on<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.980> was

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
and then the top goes on and I was

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.450 
and then the top goes on and I was
showing<00:01:46.370> you<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.580> chaff<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.560> that's

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
showing you that chaff and so that's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.420 
showing you that chaff and so that's
where<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.880> chaff<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.450> end<00:01:50.630> up<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:51.430> there

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
where the chaff will end up going there

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.850 
where the chaff will end up going there
the<00:01:52.880> top<00:01:53.120> fits<00:01:53.480> on<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:57.260> main<00:01:57.530> top

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the top fits on and then the main top

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.270 
the top fits on and then the main top
and<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.850> there<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.600> roaster<00:01:59.960> itself<00:02:00.440> these

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and so there is the roaster itself these

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.790 
and so there is the roaster itself these
are<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.420> coffee<00:02:02.630> beans<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.290> these<00:02:03.560> are
