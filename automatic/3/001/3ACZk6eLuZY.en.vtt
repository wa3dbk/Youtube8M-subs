00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and this is the main problem i have with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.369 
and this is the main problem i have with
him<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.449> only<00:00:57.570> problem<00:00:58.140> i<00:00:58.199> had

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
him and probably the only problem i had

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
him and probably the only problem i had
of<00:00:58.500> him<00:00:58.620> he<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.640> all<00:00:59.910> positioned<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of him he is out all positioned the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
of him he is out all positioned the
whole<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.879> hell<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.300> wrong<00:01:03.510> with

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
whole time what the hell is wrong with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
whole time what the hell is wrong with
him<00:01:03.870> even<00:01:04.290> though<00:01:04.500> his<00:01:04.739> positioning<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.489> meant

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
him even though his positioning is meant

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940 
him even though his positioning is meant
to<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.850> okay<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.470> thinking<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to be okay so if you are thinking of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
to be okay so if you are thinking of
buying<00:01:08.220> him<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:09.060> sure<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> know

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
buying him just make sure that you know

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
buying him just make sure that you know
that<00:01:09.900> he<00:01:10.260> won't<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.520> forward

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that he won't be in that right forward

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.179 
that he won't be in that right forward
position<00:01:12.240> most<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.409> sometimes<00:01:13.860> i'll

the only problem i had with him and if

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
the only problem i had with him and if
it<00:01:41.130> wasn't<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.060> guy<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.659> a

finessing it from anywhere you want and
it<00:02:11.340> most<00:02:11.640> likely<00:02:11.730> might<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.599> because<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it most likely might go in because the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.670 
it most likely might go in because the
goalkeepers

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
goalkeepers

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
goalkeepers

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I don't know the bookkeepers positioning

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
I don't know the bookkeepers positioning
is<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.719> stupid<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.349> game<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.950> he's<00:02:17.189> got

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
is just stupid in this game and he's got

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
is just stupid in this game and he's got
very<00:02:17.640> good<00:02:17.760> passing<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.719> want<00:02:18.930> him<00:02:19.019> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
very good passing so if you want him to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.470 
very good passing so if you want him to
cross<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.829> awesome<00:02:20.609> at<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.879> as<00:02:21.000> well<00:02:21.209> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
cross it is awesome at that as well so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170 
cross it is awesome at that as well so
that<00:02:22.170> definitely<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:23.189> be<00:02:23.219> suitable<00:02:23.969> for<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that definitely can be suitable for a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.970 
that definitely can be suitable for a
rapid<00:02:24.510> fill<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.810> role<00:02:24.989> because<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.799> guy's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
rapid fill the role because this guy's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.740 
rapid fill the role because this guy's
got<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.640> high<00:02:26.790> aggression<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.629> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
got really high aggression so if you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.349 
got really high aggression so if you
want<00:02:27.930> him<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.319> defensively<00:02:29.280> effective<00:02:29.879> he

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
want him to be defensively effective he

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.149 
want him to be defensively effective he
will<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.319> midfielder<00:02:31.769> position

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
will be in the right midfielder position

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.830 
will be in the right midfielder position
but<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.609> want<00:02:32.790> him<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.909> you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:33.659> be

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
but if you want him to you know just be

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.750
