right now that i could i'm going to be

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
right now that i could i'm going to be
telling<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> guys<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.870> might

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
telling you guys on what we might

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.369 
telling you guys on what we might
potentially<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.280> getting<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> next<00:00:57.780> t12

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
potentially be getting for the next t12

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.970 
potentially be getting for the next t12
update<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> basically<00:01:01.230> there'll<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> new

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
update so basically there'll be a new

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
update so basically there'll be a new
map<00:01:02.640> file<00:01:02.940> called<00:01:03.180> an<00:01:03.390> anvil<00:01:03.629> allowing<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> new

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
map file called an anvil allowing a new

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.539 
map file called an anvil allowing a new
height<00:01:04.860> limit<00:01:06.049> 256<00:01:07.049> instead<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> 128<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.460> will

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
height limit 256 instead of 128 so will

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.990 
height limit 256 instead of 128 so will
be<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> much<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.900> more<00:01:10.080> higher<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.670> also<00:01:11.670> will

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
be a much much more higher and also will

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.160 
be a much much more higher and also will
be<00:01:12.180> probably<00:01:12.479> getting<00:01:13.700> may<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:15.049> expanding<00:01:16.049> out

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
be probably getting may be expanding out

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.399 
be probably getting may be expanding out
the<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.159> world's<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:19.140> it's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the the world's like how it is like it's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.240 
the the world's like how it is like it's
um<00:01:20.210> it's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> small<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.619> maps<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> maps

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
um it's kind of small the maps the maps

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
um it's kind of small the maps the maps
are<00:01:23.580> small<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> micro<00:01:24.390> best<00:01:24.600> works<00:01:24.810> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
are small in the micro best works so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
are small in the micro best works so
probably<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.860> increasing<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> hundred

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
probably be increasing it by a hundred

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
probably be increasing it by a hundred
baby<00:01:27.150> well<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.770> pretty

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
baby well that that will be pretty

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
baby well that that will be pretty
fantastic<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> bigger

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
fantastic so we can have a bigger

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
fantastic so we can have a bigger
adventure<00:01:30.900> map<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.470> anything<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.950> if

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
adventure map or anything like that if

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
adventure map or anything like that if
you<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> bigger<00:01:32.790> survival<00:01:33.150> map<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.840> for

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you want a bigger survival map and for

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
you want a bigger survival map and for
the<00:01:35.119> UM<00:01:36.650> for<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> nether<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.630> layers<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the UM for the nether the layers will be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
the UM for the nether the layers will be
instead<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.549> 28<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
instead of one in 28 it will be up to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
instead of one in 28 it will be up to
255<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:45.740> also<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:47.869> will<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.990> getting<00:01:49.290> new
