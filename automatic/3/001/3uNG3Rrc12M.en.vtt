my<00:01:12.380> boots<00:01:12.740> they're<00:01:13.070> not<00:01:13.190> coming<00:01:13.460> up<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.150> game

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
my boots they're not coming up this game

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.000 
my boots they're not coming up this game
is<00:01:14.510> very<00:01:14.690> glitchy<00:01:15.110> by<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.470> way<00:01:15.710> I'm<00:01:15.830> laggy<00:01:18.010> and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
is very glitchy by the way I'm laggy and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.790 
is very glitchy by the way I'm laggy and
I<00:01:19.130> didn't<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:19.869> time<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.710> have

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
I didn't do it on time you have to have

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.070 
I didn't do it on time you have to have
precise<00:01:22.280> timing<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.660> have<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.930> get

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
precise timing with this you have to get

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.280 
precise timing with this you have to get
it<00:01:24.490> exactly<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.090> otherwise<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:27.110> won't

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
it exactly on to it otherwise it won't

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.230 
it exactly on to it otherwise it won't
work<00:01:27.500> like<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:28.009> have<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.280> get<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.580> just<00:01:29.000> before

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
work like you have to get it just before

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.499 
work like you have to get it just before
he's<00:01:29.600> trained<00:01:31.060> there<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:32.180> go

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
he's trained there we go

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.020 
he's trained there we go
as<00:01:32.570> he<00:01:33.440> hits<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.740> train<00:01:34.040> actually<00:01:34.520> while<00:01:34.820> he's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
as he hits the train actually while he's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.499 
as he hits the train actually while he's
hitting<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.479> train<00:01:35.750> got<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:36.740> it

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.310

just get it on you can go through

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.830 
just get it on you can go through
actually<00:02:18.959> go<00:02:19.380> through<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.980> obstacles<00:02:20.720> let<00:02:21.720> me

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
actually go through the obstacles let me
