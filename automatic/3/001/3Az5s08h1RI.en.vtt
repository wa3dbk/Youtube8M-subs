people had which was how we animated the
web<00:00:15.930> for<00:00:16.410> Lego<00:00:16.800> spider-man<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.610> you<00:00:18.180> might<00:00:18.300> be

web for Lego spider-man and you might be

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.440 
web for Lego spider-man and you might be
familiar<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.410> element<00:00:19.860> which<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
familiar with this element which is a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.790 
familiar with this element which is a
Lego<00:00:21.450> string<00:00:21.840> piece<00:00:22.079> and<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.410> got<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> bunch

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
Lego string piece and it's got a bunch

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.310 
Lego string piece and it's got a bunch
of<00:00:22.919> bars<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.790> molded<00:00:24.660> around<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.110> so<00:00:25.290> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of bars kind of molded around it so that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.979 
of bars kind of molded around it so that
minifigures<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.189> grasp<00:00:26.400> bond<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.270> while<00:00:27.960> I

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
minifigures can grasp bond and while I

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.540 
minifigures can grasp bond and while I
would<00:00:28.200> have<00:00:28.290> loved<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.739> just<00:00:28.860> animated

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
would have loved to have just animated

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.609 
would have loved to have just animated
this<00:00:29.849> piece<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.360> spider-man's<00:00:31.110> web<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this piece as spider-man's web it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
this piece as spider-man's web it
doesn't<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.220> hold<00:00:32.430> its<00:00:32.669> shape<00:00:32.759> well<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
doesn't really hold its shape well and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.050 
doesn't really hold its shape well and
the<00:00:34.350> way<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.680> were<00:00:34.800> animating<00:00:35.160> his<00:00:35.790> web

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
the way we were animating his web

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.540 
the way we were animating his web
slinging<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.840> required<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.559> element

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
slinging kind of required an element

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.759 
slinging kind of required an element
that<00:00:38.760> could<00:00:39.030> hold<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.390> shape<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> didn't

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
that could hold a shape so I didn't

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.290 
that could hold a shape so I didn't
actually<00:00:40.890> end<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.969> string

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
actually end up using this string

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.169 
actually end up using this string
element<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.019> spider-man's<00:00:43.469> animation<00:00:44.179> what

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
element for spider-man's animation what

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.000 
element for spider-man's animation what
I<00:00:45.210> did<00:00:45.420> instead<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:46.109> I<00:00:46.410> took<00:00:46.679> a<00:00:46.710> piece<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I did instead was I took a piece of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.689 
I did instead was I took a piece of
white<00:00:47.519> Technic<00:00:48.120> tubing<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.500> cut<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> into<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
white Technic tubing and I cut it into a

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.970 
white Technic tubing and I cut it into a
bunch<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.089> very<00:00:51.390> small<00:00:51.839> sections<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bunch of very small sections like this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.610 
bunch of very small sections like this
and<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:54.210> Technic<00:00:54.539> tubing<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and the Technic tubing is actually the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
and the Technic tubing is actually the
same<00:00:55.859> diameter<00:00:56.249> as<00:00:56.489> each<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.059> little

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
same diameter as each of these little

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.380 
same diameter as each of these little
bar<00:00:57.600> pieces<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:59.399> pieces<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.910> cut<00:01:00.179> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
bar pieces and the pieces that I cut of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
bar pieces and the pieces that I cut of
the<00:01:00.510> Technic<00:01:00.809> tubing<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.620> length

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the Technic tubing are the same length

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.090 
the Technic tubing are the same length
as<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.760> bar<00:01:02.909> pieces<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> had<00:01:04.100> basically

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
as the bar pieces so I had basically

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.790 
as the bar pieces so I had basically
kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.580> an<00:01:05.670> approximation<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.170> bars<00:01:07.440> on

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
kind of an approximation of the bars on

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.400 
kind of an approximation of the bars on
this<00:01:08.190> string<00:01:08.520> element<00:01:08.940> but<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.020> once<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.260> had

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
this string element but then once I had

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.770 
this string element but then once I had
that<00:01:10.620> how<00:01:11.160> do<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> make<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.820> string<00:01:12.300> that<00:01:12.600> can

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that how do you make a string that can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620 
that how do you make a string that can
hold<00:01:12.990> its<00:01:13.230> shape<00:01:13.670> well<00:01:14.670> instead<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> using<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hold its shape well instead of using a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.320 
hold its shape well instead of using a
string<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.230> looked<00:01:17.190> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> various<00:01:17.790> lengths

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
string I looked at the various lengths

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.040 
string I looked at the various lengths
of<00:01:18.510> wire<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.260> found<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.660> Technic

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
of wire and found one that the Technic

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.820 
of wire and found one that the Technic
tubing<00:01:22.410> would<00:01:23.400> fit<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.790> perfectly<00:01:24.830> kind

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
tubing would fit around perfectly kind

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.900 
tubing would fit around perfectly kind
of<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:27.860> then<00:01:28.860> once<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.400> had<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.700> wire<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
of like that then once I had the wire I

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.210 
of like that then once I had the wire I
needed<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.110> Technic<00:01:31.470> tubing<00:01:31.770> pieces<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
needed and the Technic tubing pieces I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.390 
needed and the Technic tubing pieces I
needed<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.700> sat<00:01:33.510> down<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.280> bit

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
needed I sat down and with a little bit

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.610 
needed I sat down and with a little bit
of<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:36.030> patience<00:01:36.420> glued<00:01:37.350> them<00:01:37.530> all

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
of time and patience glued them all

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.320 
of time and patience glued them all
together<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.370> something<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:38.970> looks<00:01:39.210> like

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
together into something that looks like

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.660 
together into something that looks like
this<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> piece<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this and this is actually the piece that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.820 
this and this is actually the piece that
we<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.390> animate<00:01:42.720> spider-man's<00:01:43.380> web<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
we used to animate spider-man's web and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.830 
we used to animate spider-man's web and
you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.150> kind<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.360> bend<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.690> into

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
you can see you can kind of bend it into

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.500 
you can see you can kind of bend it into
any<00:01:46.050> shape<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.940> it'll<00:01:47.940> hold<00:01:48.330> that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
any shape you want and it'll hold that

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.110 
any shape you want and it'll hold that
shape<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.340> when<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> came<00:01:50.550> time<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.970> have

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
shape so when it came time to have

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.570 
shape so when it came time to have
spider-man<00:01:51.810> swinging<00:01:52.170> around<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> city<00:01:52.710> it's

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
spider-man swinging around the city it's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.520 
spider-man swinging around the city it's
just<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.820> matter<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.120> sticking<00:01:54.810> his<00:01:55.110> arm<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
just a matter of sticking his arm on

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.860 
just a matter of sticking his arm on
there<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> attached<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> top<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
there and then I attached the top of the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.690 
there and then I attached the top of the
web<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.680> support<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.400> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
web to a little support that was just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
web to a little support that was just
off-screen<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.480> from<00:02:01.470> there<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.800> only<00:02:01.950> thing

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
off-screen and from there the only thing

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
off-screen and from there the only thing
left<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> figure<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.300> actually

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
left was to figure out how to actually

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080 
left was to figure out how to actually
animate<00:02:04.020> someone<00:02:04.530> swinging<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> web<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
animate someone swinging on a web but I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.640 
animate someone swinging on a web but I
think<00:02:06.720> that's<00:02:06.870> probably<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.230> whole<00:02:07.440> other

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
think that's probably a whole other

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.609 
think that's probably a whole other
video<00:02:08.509> anyway<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.720> hope<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.170> answers<00:02:10.590> your

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
video anyway I hope that answers your

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740 
video anyway I hope that answers your
questions<00:02:11.099> about<00:02:11.430> how<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> made<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.269> string

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
questions about how I made this string

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.390 
questions about how I made this string
element<00:02:12.870> into<00:02:13.590> something<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.130> usable

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
element into something that was usable

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.350 
element into something that was usable
for<00:02:14.700> animation

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
for animation

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
for animation
it's<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.020> little<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> cheat<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
it's a little bit of a cheat and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.460 
it's a little bit of a cheat and
if<00:02:17.760> you're<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> lego<00:02:18.480> purist<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.080> might<00:02:19.320> not

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
if you're a lego purist you might not

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
if you're a lego purist you might not
approve<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.670> worked<00:02:20.850> perfectly<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.450> what

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
approve but it worked perfectly for what

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.710 
approve but it worked perfectly for what
we<00:02:21.690> needed<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> do

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.780
