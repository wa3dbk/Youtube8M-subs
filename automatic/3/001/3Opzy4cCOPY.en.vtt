00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
invasive plants is they move into our

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.819 
invasive plants is they move into our
natural<00:02:13.450> areas<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.049> they<00:02:14.290> start<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.650> take

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
natural areas and they start to take

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.319 
natural areas and they start to take

how do I get rid of it the best way to
do<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.579> is<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.030> try<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.239> remove<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> by

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
do it is just to try to remove it by

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.509 
do it is just to try to remove it by
pulling<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.440> that's<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.920> most<00:02:36.130> organic

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
pulling it that that's the most organic

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.009 
pulling it that that's the most organic
and<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> least<00:02:37.239> sort<00:02:37.389> of<00:02:37.480> intrusive<00:02:37.810> to

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
and the least sort of intrusive to

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.259 
and the least sort of intrusive to
things<00:02:38.350> there's<00:02:38.920> also<00:02:39.130> more<00:02:39.489> organic<00:02:39.940> ways<00:02:40.090> of

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
things there's also more organic ways of

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.420 
things there's also more organic ways of
using<00:02:40.389> vinegar<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:41.139> an<00:02:41.350> herbicide<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.040> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
using vinegar as an herbicide and you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.009 
using vinegar as an herbicide and you
can't<00:02:42.639> actually<00:02:42.819> turn<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.120> herbicides<00:02:43.569> if<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
can't actually turn to herbicides if you

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.360 
can't actually turn to herbicides if you
follow<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> label<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.889> instructions

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
follow the label in the instructions

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.870 
follow the label in the instructions
properly<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.650> if<00:02:47.799> identify<00:02:48.370> these<00:02:48.579> in<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
properly so if identify these in the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.970 
properly so if identify these in the
yard<00:02:49.120> should<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.450> take<00:02:49.660> them<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.930> fall<00:02:50.440> spring

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
yard should I take them out fall spring

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500 
yard should I take them out fall spring
winter<00:02:51.340> when's<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.790> best<00:02:51.910> time<00:02:52.030> usually

herbicide this time of year the plants
are<00:03:00.970> taking<00:03:01.120> all<00:03:01.359> that<00:03:01.450> nutrition<00:03:01.959> back<00:03:02.200> into

today we've talked about taking
those<00:03:40.240> invasive<00:03:40.540> plants<00:03:41.080> removing<00:03:41.740> them<00:03:41.890> from

those invasive plants removing them from
the<00:03:42.250> environment<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.940> allowing<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.690> native
