00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm fine. I came here today. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 here to give you some drawing and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 asked in the comments to make 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.780
 This is how I decided to do it and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 not start talking about the zagat acre that is 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 a harder act is to humanize a risk 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 so but drier but more erased and is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.039
 Hard to quit, you can not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.130
 kapok 3h 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.510
 then there is the intermediate hb 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:39.140
 entered a and b 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:39.140
 I'm making you have ohe have op 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 The greater the number here, the harder it is. 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.829
 will be the greater the number here but 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.039
 mole will be then oh 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.039
 I think it's harder and usually here. 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.610
 We do not use it so much, but I use more 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.309
 to do so is seen effort to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.220
 start drawing even then but you 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.649
 b may have a pencil and will serve the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.740
 same way to say that it is a phase b 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.229
 and looks at his risk on the risk side of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.869
 pencil to gal 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:22.360
 looks like the baby much stronger much more 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.360
 soft it loose well there's more smoking 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 of course not give up as much as 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.170
 a pencil for example 16 b but he was already 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.649
 approach when caught in a rain 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.280
 practically nothing 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:40.310
 the fish is then foam b 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.090
 this is a pencil 6b so pencils well 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.090
 soft 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:54.099
 we used to make shade to make 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:59.020
 which are darker and super soft areas 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.020
 it's very easy to smoke 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.770
 and there is also the 8 b that has up to 19 see 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.569
 19 more in time to show it to you and 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.650
 this one is 8b it is very very soft 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.370
 It's very dark too so we have 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.500
 hb that the intermediate to harder cat 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.590
 and the softest bacon the best for 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 draw to start drawing are the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.430
 baby because it 's softer but only draw 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.489
 easier to then pay are soft 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.470
 good to draw are the baby then 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.230
 so if you want to start you can 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.810
 start buying one to spend to have a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.260
 pencil a little harder then like 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 office hagar against a baby with two b16 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.590
 and 18 times as you want and also 19 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.239
 promotes holds cases already ready the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.940
 office as soon as it comes with all 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.900
 types of pencils but you can choose the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.310
 that you preferred what you think it is 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.019
 better and also have this one just took 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.139
 to show you what a pencil is 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:14.930
 coal 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:18.130
 it is very close to youtube but the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.130
 car even darker 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.610
 this one here to make charcoal drawings 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.830
 You have to use a fixative after 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.769
 because otherwise it will erase all the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.170
 I forgot to mention this challenge. 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.599
 here that the evolution of the brand w 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 and it's a great brand but you can use 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.690
 brand you prefer fab 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.470
 the margin was easier to find but 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.519
 the ones I use are from the stable and 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.410
 also the same thing if 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.200
 You 're starting to draw start. 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.510
 with pencil you can not do it because it's more 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.030
 difficult is the one that scales but the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.880
 leaf then begins the first to draw 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.709
 with pencil and there was only can draw 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.280
 how they did it but I really prefer it 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.690
 draw with pencil and here we have 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.200
 103 the first of the brand by tel 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.780
 this is a 0 3 this is a rule 5 and 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.239
 This is a 07 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:26.520
 just look here at 05 tac a graphite b 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.050
 The soft well, well, the grind at 07 she's with 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.800
 graphite h 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.350
 so look normally you could 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.520
 think that to 07 make a dash more 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.830
 thicker and stronger than 05 more per 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.530
 cause she 's graffiti she does 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.120
 a weaker trait that graphite and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.409
 feel that it is harder as long as the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.419
 other 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.550
 is much softer and can make the 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.550
 The exchange is darker and the one here 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:00.899
 the series had the same thing then it has 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.129
 various types of graphite I caught the girl 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.979
 show you 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:09.029
 this one is 107 hp or whatever 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.949
 so normal we are one day 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:17.729
 Good to write with him then it would be 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:22.379
 neither so hard nor so soft but it is 107 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:27.029
 105 b or more that is what 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:30.239
 you're here even if you were 10 without paying 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:34.469
 extra would be weaker because graphite 

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:37.679
 is much harder here have O 052 b that 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.860
 105 more grinder than this one even I 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:47.189
 Can I do a stronger risk? 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:48.059
 using the same fair 05 on 07 and here 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.479
 also 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:54.389
 O 105 hb that is keeping a diary is not 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.169
 neither so glance nor so hard glasses good 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.769
 also to write a graphite and here 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:05.129
 has another brand of graphite has 107 hv 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:08.969
 also that it is intermediate, I know that 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.139
 I'm wearing a benton it would be normal 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.519
 also 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.069
 so that's what I had to talk to 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.779
 You on graphite pencil 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.339
 I hope you have understood if 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.569
 have any questions let us 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.639
 comments 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.849
 while also the rubber that you should 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.619
 using rubber selected so the molinha 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.319
 rubber of that same brand which is also 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.629
 very good but any rubber a line 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.360
 also then it serves it so hopefully 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.729
 you have 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.969
 the state a super kiss and until the next 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.969
 video
