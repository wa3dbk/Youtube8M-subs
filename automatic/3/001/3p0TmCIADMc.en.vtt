the star so here's how to make the
souffles<00:01:02.489> we're<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:02.999> to<00:01:03.059> start<00:01:03.299> out<00:01:03.479> by

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
souffles we're going to start out by

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
souffles we're going to start out by
melting<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.199> chocolate<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:04.949> bit

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
melting some chocolate with a little bit

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160 
melting some chocolate with a little bit
of<00:01:05.280> milk<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> tiny<00:01:06.150> bit<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.540> butter<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of milk and a tiny bit of butter and I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.290 
of milk and a tiny bit of butter and I
like<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> add<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.650> pinch<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.160> salt<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.820> it's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
like to add a pinch of salt to this it's

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.930 
like to add a pinch of salt to this it's
an<00:01:09.420> unspecific<00:01:09.930> amount<00:01:10.620> but<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.980> makes<00:01:11.730> for

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
an unspecific amount but it makes for

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.630 
an unspecific amount but it makes for
good<00:01:12.150> flavor<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.410> point<00:01:13.770> three<00:01:14.370> egg

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
good flavor and at this point three egg

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
good flavor and at this point three egg
yolks<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> stir

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
yolks go in and I'm just going to stir

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.840 
yolks go in and I'm just going to stir
those<00:01:17.190> around<00:01:18.830> now<00:01:19.830> I've<00:01:19.980> simplified<00:01:20.430> these

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
those around now I've simplified these

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
those around now I've simplified these
two<00:01:21.060> filets<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> process<00:01:22.860> again

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
two filets so much in the process again

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.150 
two filets so much in the process again
to<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.360> sure<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
to make sure that it's all about the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.220 
to make sure that it's all about the
chocolate<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.940> if<00:01:27.270> you've<00:01:27.540> made<00:01:27.720> souffles

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
chocolate so if you've made souffles

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.720 
chocolate so if you've made souffles
before<00:01:28.650> you'll<00:01:28.800> notice<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.160> I've<00:01:29.400> skipped

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
before you'll notice that I've skipped

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.390 
before you'll notice that I've skipped
some<00:01:29.970> steps<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.510> made<00:01:30.660> this<00:01:30.810> even<00:01:31.170> easier<00:01:31.400> now

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
some steps and made this even easier now

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.870 
some steps and made this even easier now
i'm<00:01:32.550> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.760> put<00:01:32.910> four<00:01:33.240> egg<00:01:33.540> whites<00:01:33.570> into

i'm going to put four egg whites into
clean<00:01:35.880> dry<00:01:36.060> mix<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.510> all<00:01:36.660> I'm<00:01:37.050> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> beat

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
clean dry mix of all I'm going to beat

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.630 
clean dry mix of all I'm going to beat

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
when the egg whites look like they're

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.140 
when the egg whites look like they're
sniffing<00:01:53.340> shiny<00:01:54.350> know<00:01:55.350> sometimes<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.120> like<00:01:57.120> to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
sniffing shiny know sometimes I like to

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.090 
sniffing shiny know sometimes I like to
finish<00:01:57.510> them<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> few<00:01:58.380> strokes<00:02:01.100> now

finish them up with a few strokes now
the<00:02:02.160> usual<00:02:02.700> technique<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.420> twofold<00:02:03.870> just<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the usual technique is twofold just a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.320 
the usual technique is twofold just a
little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.340> egg<00:02:05.460> whites<00:02:05.760> into<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
little bit of the egg whites into the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.510 
little bit of the egg whites into the
chocolate<00:02:06.690> batter<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.440> first<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.070> lighten<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
chocolate batter at first to lighten the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
chocolate batter at first to lighten the
chocolate<00:02:08.910> batter<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.500> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> go

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
chocolate batter and I'm going to go

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
chocolate batter and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.460> like<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.850> use<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> nice

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
ahead and do that I like to use a nice

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.880 
ahead and do that I like to use a nice
big<00:02:12.540> bowl<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.110> there's<00:02:13.290> plenty<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.590> room<00:02:13.680> for

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
big bowl so there's plenty of room for

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.040 
big bowl so there's plenty of room for
that<00:02:14.160> folding<00:02:14.640> stroke<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:17.490> then<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.690> rest<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that folding stroke and then the rest of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.040 
that folding stroke and then the rest of
the<00:02:19.140> egg<00:02:19.260> whites<00:02:20.180> quite<00:02:21.180> frankly<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the egg whites quite frankly I like to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.560 
the egg whites quite frankly I like to
switch<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> giant<00:02:23.250> giant<00:02:23.640> spatula<00:02:24.180> because

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
switch to a giant giant spatula because

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.060 
switch to a giant giant spatula because
it's<00:02:24.840> better<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.290> folding<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.920> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
at least three-quarters full one secret

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.340 
at least three-quarters full one secret
is<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.209> fill<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.570> little<00:03:18.780> higher<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.230> you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
is to fill in a little higher and you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.530 
is to fill in a little higher and you
get<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:20.160> bit<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.850> boost<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.390> the

oven from them or the other way to cheat

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.310 
oven from them or the other way to cheat
is<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.700> use<00:03:23.970> smaller<00:03:24.330> cups<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.049> fill<00:03:25.230> them

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
is to use smaller cups and fill them

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.420 
is to use smaller cups and fill them
higher<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.799> then<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> little<00:03:26.280> more

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
higher and then you get a little more

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.970 
higher and then you get a little more
drama<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:27.030> they<00:03:27.150> rise<00:03:27.410> now<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.620> has<00:03:28.799> been
