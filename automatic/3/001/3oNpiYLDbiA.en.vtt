00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
Canadian rock maple prototype flute

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
Canadian rock maple prototype flute
which<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> prototype<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> other

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
which was the prototype for the other

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
which was the prototype for the other
two<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.649> reason<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> brought<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.370> today<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
two and the reason I brought it today is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
two and the reason I brought it today is
because<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.960> been<00:01:01.260> used<00:01:01.530> fairly<00:01:02.160> heavily

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because it's been used fairly heavily

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.529 
because it's been used fairly heavily
over<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> past<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.210> years

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
over the past three years

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
over the past three years
and<00:01:03.690> has<00:01:04.049> received<00:01:04.350> regular<00:01:04.589> regular<00:01:05.430> oiling

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and has received regular regular oiling

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.020 
and has received regular regular oiling
with<00:01:06.710> almond<00:01:07.710> oil<00:01:07.890> well<00:01:08.220> initially<00:01:08.460> tung<00:01:08.850> oil

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
with almond oil well initially tung oil

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.070 
with almond oil well initially tung oil
and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.840> since<00:01:10.260> almond<00:01:11.070> oil<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.659> oil<00:01:12.689> has

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and then since almond oil so the oil has

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
and then since almond oil so the oil has
had<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> chance<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.040> absorb<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> wood<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
had a chance to absorb into the wood and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
had a chance to absorb into the wood and
harden<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> surface<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> wood<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
harden on the surface the wood over the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
harden on the surface the wood over the
past<00:01:17.909> few<00:01:18.030> years<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> maybe<00:01:18.960> you'll<00:01:19.259> detect<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
past few years and maybe you'll detect a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
past few years and maybe you'll detect a
difference<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.460> tone<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.500> so

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
difference in tone because of that so

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.160 
difference in tone because of that so
I'm<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.770> play<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.189> fairly<00:01:23.850> well-known<00:01:24.170> reel

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I'm gonna play a fairly well-known reel

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
I'm gonna play a fairly well-known reel
on<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:26.159> three<00:01:26.520> flutes<00:01:26.759> we're<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
on these three flutes we're going to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.740 
on these three flutes we're going to
start<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.009> African<00:01:29.009> Blackwood<00:01:29.250> flute

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and I'll just boot into it a little bit

00:01:32.850 --> 00:02:24.740 
and I'll just boot into it a little bit
to<00:01:33.000> give<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.780> idea<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> tone

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750

next we'll play the Canadian rock maple

00:02:27.819 --> 00:03:20.420 
next we'll play the Canadian rock maple
flute<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> was<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.690> finished<00:02:28.989> last<00:02:29.170> week

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.100 

you<00:03:21.430> ought<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.610> excuse<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.270> few<00:03:22.570> mistakes<00:03:22.690> in

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
you ought to excuse a few mistakes in

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.430 
you ought to excuse a few mistakes in
there<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> test<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.580> tone<00:03:25.440> rather

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
there this is a test for tone rather

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.630 
there this is a test for tone rather
than<00:03:27.270> competency<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.800> last<00:03:30.010> flute<00:03:30.520> we're

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
than competency and the last flute we're

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.380 
than competency and the last flute we're
going<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.820> try<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.750> rock<00:03:32.230> maple<00:03:33.390> Canadian

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
going to try is a rock maple Canadian

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.990 
going to try is a rock maple Canadian
rock<00:03:34.570> maple<00:03:34.750> prototype<00:03:35.530> flute<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.040> was<00:03:36.100> made

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
rock maple prototype flute that was made

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.600 
rock maple prototype flute that was made
about<00:03:37.120> three<00:03:37.420> years<00:03:37.540> ago<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:39.040> has<00:03:39.220> been

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
about three years ago and it has been

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.740 
about three years ago and it has been
regularly<00:03:40.060> oiled<00:03:40.740> since<00:03:41.740> and<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:43.540> least

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
regularly oiled since and at least

00:03:43.750 --> 00:04:53.010 
regularly oiled since and at least
monthly<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:45.130> almond<00:03:45.490> oil

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.159 

so<00:04:54.020> there<00:04:54.199> you<00:04:54.229> have<00:04:54.469> it<00:04:54.680> three<00:04:54.889> flutes<00:04:56.169> fairly

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
so there you have it three flutes fairly

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.129 
so there you have it three flutes fairly
identical<00:04:57.289> in<00:04:57.999> manufacture<00:04:58.999> the<00:04:59.599> first<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.020> an

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
identical in manufacture the first is an

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.200 
identical in manufacture the first is an
african<00:05:00.589> blackwood<00:05:00.860> flu<00:05:01.309> so<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.610> lot<00:05:01.879> denser

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
african blackwood flu so a lot denser

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.959 
african blackwood flu so a lot denser
wood<00:05:02.629> and<00:05:02.930> wood<00:05:03.529> that<00:05:03.589> most<00:05:04.339> Irish<00:05:04.699> food

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
wood and wood that most Irish food
