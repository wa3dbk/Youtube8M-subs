00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.870
 and rotation of the body and the hip 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.860
 between the arms 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.580
 at first 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.840
 this condition 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.320
 this condition 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:47.770
 let's try to start walking the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:51.100
 steps are the first to say that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.100
 they start walking 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.780
 to get started 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.930
 the movement of crossing 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.150
 because I'm cold 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.019
 the body is the same 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.780
 the company with the movement of 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:47.150
 move forward one step forward 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.569
 once they learn this pretty much 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.730
 they say good I'm a little more comfortable and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.459
 I think I've already grabbed his hands back 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.069
 leave it there everything can be given a 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.160
 position and it's already apprentice principle 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.569
 with cones going putting knew if I 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.110
 I want to do from here to back always 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.110
 true left to the ball back 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.189
 and this is 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.189
 personal 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.810
 behind 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.790
 today a lot of fear 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 yes 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.680
 the next step 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.900
 and look where it's going 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.680
 paths to a magnesium turn that is 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.680
 important commented 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.050
 ah 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.340
 until completion 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.290
 the truth 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:27.110
 to the rotation of the body at minute to 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:27.110
 ensure that you look at it by force 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.180
 movement determination 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.120
 will leave many more things 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:06:04.720
 it's something you do not learn in the morning 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:17.250
 the issue is that midmorning 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:17.250
 at the end of week 34 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.889
 but it is not over, it is not understood 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.379
 those are the basic steps for more or 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:36.840
 least start learning to cross by 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.840
 front personal too 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.210
 when we do this 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.820
 stable 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.820
 all right
