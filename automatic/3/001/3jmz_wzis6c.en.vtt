rim tips correct all the fine details
it's<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.340> 100<00:00:28.640> mile<00:00:28.820> race<00:00:29.149> so<00:00:30.489> and<00:00:31.489> he's<00:00:31.669> not

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's a 100 mile race so and he's not

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.610 
it's a 100 mile race so and he's not
traveling<00:00:32.270> over<00:00:32.480> here<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.840> doing<00:00:33.050> two<00:00:33.380> weeks

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
traveling over here and doing two weeks

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.210 
traveling over here and doing two weeks
of<00:00:33.800> altitude<00:00:34.340> altitude<00:00:34.670> training<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.600> lose

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
of altitude altitude training to lose

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.990 
of altitude altitude training to lose
he's<00:00:37.600> he's<00:00:38.600> pushing<00:00:38.960> very<00:00:38.990> hard<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.650> I<00:00:39.740> think

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
he's he's pushing very hard and I think

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.250 
he's he's pushing very hard and I think
the<00:00:41.000> wind<00:00:41.180> won't<00:00:41.300> be<00:00:41.480> enough<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.810> him<00:00:41.930> I'd<00:00:42.080> say

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
the wind won't be enough for him I'd say

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.390 
the wind won't be enough for him I'd say
he'll<00:00:42.440> be<00:00:42.470> pushing<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:42.920> get<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.190> course

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
he'll be pushing to get the course

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:52.090 
he'll be pushing to get the course
record<00:00:48.790> so<00:00:49.790> tomorrow<00:00:50.150> we<00:00:50.630> have<00:00:50.990> three<00:00:51.860> feet

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
record so tomorrow we have three feet

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.050 
record so tomorrow we have three feet
zones<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:54.260> out<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:54.710> back<00:00:54.950> race<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:55.730> in

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
zones and it's out in back race so in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.110 
zones and it's out in back race so in
both<00:00:56.300> speed<00:00:56.720> zones<00:00:57.050> I'll<00:00:57.590> take<00:00:58.250> two<00:00:58.880> bottles

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
both speed zones I'll take two bottles

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.960 
both speed zones I'll take two bottles
ones<00:00:59.870> on<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.800> way<00:01:00.920> out<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.370> once<00:01:01.670> on<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.850> way

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.899 
ones on the way out and once on the way
back<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.860> feeds<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:05.860> pipeline<00:01:06.909> seats

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
back so this is feeds on pipeline seats

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.450 
back so this is feeds on pipeline seats

gonna be super important that everyone
knows<00:01:32.960> exactly<00:01:33.170> what<00:01:33.619> which<00:01:33.830> bottles<00:01:34.190> would

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
knows exactly what which bottles would

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.149 
knows exactly what which bottles would
go<00:01:34.520> where<00:01:34.760> because<00:01:35.690> if<00:01:36.020> if<00:01:36.680> they<00:01:36.830> get<00:01:36.979> messed

go where because if if they get messed

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.910 
go where because if if they get messed
up<00:01:37.369> or<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:38.750> know<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.229> could<00:01:39.260> mean<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
up or you know it could mean the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.580 
up or you know it could mean the
difference<00:01:39.950> between<00:01:40.400> like<00:01:41.380> not<00:01:42.380> getting

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
difference between like not getting

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.530 
difference between like not getting
enough<00:01:42.770> energy<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.340> not<00:01:43.670> finishing<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.450> race

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
enough energy and not finishing the race

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.590 
enough energy and not finishing the race
with<00:01:44.780> enough<00:01:45.369> enough<00:01:46.369> carbs<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.000> blowing

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
with enough enough carbs and blowing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.179 
with enough enough carbs and blowing
towards<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.049> end<00:01:48.200> which<00:01:48.619> then<00:01:48.890> could<00:01:49.040> mean

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
towards the end which then could mean

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.770 
towards the end which then could mean
someone<00:01:49.490> else<00:01:49.549> passing<00:01:49.970> him<00:01:50.090> who<00:01:50.180> has<00:01:50.540> been

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
someone else passing him who has been

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.590 
someone else passing him who has been
feeding<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:52.490> hit<00:01:52.640> obviously<00:01:53.180> marking<00:01:53.510> all

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
feeding so we hit obviously marking all

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.960 
feeding so we hit obviously marking all
the<00:01:53.689> bottles<00:01:53.900> properly<00:01:54.350> making<00:01:55.040> sure<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.670> I

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
the bottles properly making sure that I

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.560 
the bottles properly making sure that I
kind<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.780> almost<00:01:57.430> overcompensating<00:01:58.430> career<00:01:58.790> I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
kind of almost overcompensating career I

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.570 
kind of almost overcompensating career I
was<00:01:59.930> going<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.140> be<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.259> lot<00:02:00.619> more<00:02:00.799> food<00:02:01.159> than<00:02:01.340> he

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
was going to be a lot more food than he

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.109 
was going to be a lot more food than he
actually<00:02:01.670> needs<00:02:02.090> but<00:02:02.979> it's<00:02:03.979> better<00:02:04.189> better<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
actually needs but it's better better to

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.380 
actually needs but it's better better to
do<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.450> way<00:02:05.600> then<00:02:05.840> not<00:02:06.290> have<00:02:06.439> enough<00:02:07.390> heating

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
do that way then not have enough heating

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.620 
do that way then not have enough heating
wise<00:02:08.750> not<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.379> hundred<00:02:09.649> percent<00:02:09.769> decided<00:02:10.639> yet

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.850 
gonna start with a bar and then I have
two<00:02:15.680> different<00:02:15.860> gels<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.790> liquid<00:02:17.450> energy

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
two different gels one is liquid energy

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.010 
two different gels one is liquid energy
long<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.130> one<00:02:19.400> energy<00:02:20.060> plus<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:20.810> year

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
long and one energy plus so this year

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.350 
long and one energy plus so this year
contains<00:02:21.500> most<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.010> faster<00:02:22.550> sugar<00:02:22.820> this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
contains most of the faster sugar this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.040 
contains most of the faster sugar this
is<00:02:23.510> more<00:02:23.870> sustained<00:02:24.710> very<00:02:25.220> low<00:02:25.720> GI<00:02:28.150> energy<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
is more sustained very low GI energy is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.590 
is more sustained very low GI energy is
these<00:02:30.470> these<00:02:31.250> are<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.460> music's<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:32.120> feedbacks

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
these these are the music's or feedbacks

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.470 
these these are the music's or feedbacks
that<00:02:32.780> we'll<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.200> using<00:02:33.290> tomorrow

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that we'll be using tomorrow

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290 
that we'll be using tomorrow
so<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.230> each<00:02:36.800> pitch<00:02:37.220> bag<00:02:37.460> will<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.120> two

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
so so each pitch bag will have the two

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.670 
so so each pitch bag will have the two
bottles<00:02:38.600> it'll<00:02:39.140> have<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:40.060> bar<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.230> has

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
bottles it'll have a bar and then it has

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.040 
bottles it'll have a bar and then it has
the<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.280> journals<00:02:44.180> attached<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> bottle

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
the the journals attached to the bottle

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.280 
the the journals attached to the bottle
so<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.380> easy<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.680> grab<00:02:45.950> out<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.080> then

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
so it's easy to grab out and then

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.750 
so it's easy to grab out and then
whatever<00:02:48.470> fruit<00:02:48.860> whatever<00:02:49.190> else<00:02:49.400> will<00:02:49.640> make

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
whatever fruit whatever else will make

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.900 
whatever fruit whatever else will make
some<00:02:49.970> small<00:02:50.180> cakes<00:02:50.780> tomorrow<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.370> then<00:02:52.760> you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
some small cakes tomorrow and then you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.000 
some small cakes tomorrow and then you
have<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.360> there<00:02:53.510> as<00:02:53.600> well<00:02:53.860> well<00:02:54.860> it's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
have them in there as well well it's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.400 
have them in there as well well it's
more<00:02:55.250> complex<00:02:56.260> tomorrow<00:02:57.460> first<00:02:58.460> of<00:02:58.640> all

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
more complex tomorrow first of all

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.690 
more complex tomorrow first of all
you're<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.440> coming<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.130> off<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.430> ten

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
you're not coming like off the ten

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.250 
you're not coming like off the ten
minutes<00:03:02.000> right<00:03:02.150> away<00:03:02.330> into<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.630> feed<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:02.960> again

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
minutes right away into a feed so again

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.560 
minutes right away into a feed so again
if<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.500> don't<00:03:03.650> miss<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> bowl<00:03:04.490> in<00:03:05.330> cross

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
if you don't miss a bowl in cross

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.360 
if you don't miss a bowl in cross
country<00:03:05.840> doesn't<00:03:06.620> matter<00:03:06.770> if<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.190> easy

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
be a half lap or a lot without ball and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.420 
be a half lap or a lot without ball and
then<00:03:12.130> tomorrow<00:03:14.080> actually<00:03:15.080> buy<00:03:15.560> or<00:03:15.740> do<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.400> by

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
then tomorrow actually buy or do it by

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.390 
then tomorrow actually buy or do it by
myself<00:03:17.020> it's<00:03:18.020> also<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.440> lay<00:03:18.650> out<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.100> know<00:03:19.220> all

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
myself it's also to lay out you know all

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.970 
myself it's also to lay out you know all
those<00:03:19.580> bubbles<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.720> see<00:03:20.930> water<00:03:21.230> enough<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
those bubbles to see water enough on the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.680 
those bubbles to see water enough on the
balls<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.610> bottles<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.090> cross<00:03:23.390> count

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
balls and in the bottles in cross count

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.780 
balls and in the bottles in cross count
you<00:03:23.840> have<00:03:24.020> all<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.320> experience<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:25.610> know

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
you have all the experience you know

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.580 
you have all the experience you know
every<00:03:26.270> ten<00:03:26.450> minutes<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.900> come<00:03:27.080> around<00:03:27.230> again

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
every ten minutes you come around again

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.490 
every ten minutes you come around again
so<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.610> tell<00:03:29.180> Pete<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.630> want<00:03:29.930> that's<00:03:30.140> it

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so just tell Pete what I want that's it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.860 
so just tell Pete what I want that's it
but<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:31.730> wanted<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> see<00:03:32.540> with

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
but here I actually wanted to see with

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.570 
but here I actually wanted to see with
the<00:03:33.110> bubbles<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.590> know<00:03:33.800> what<00:03:34.040> are<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.340> time

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
the bubbles you know what are the time

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.090 
the bubbles you know what are the time
gaps<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:35.120> between<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.840> between<00:03:38.830> twin<00:03:39.830> lakes

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
gaps in between like between twin lakes

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.750 
gaps in between like between twin lakes
and<00:03:41.170> pipeline<00:03:42.170> it's<00:03:42.680> going<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.040> be<00:03:43.130> short<00:03:43.459> but

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and pipeline it's going to be short but

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.390 
and pipeline it's going to be short but
then<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.780> have<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.170> big<00:03:45.380> climb<00:03:45.650> up<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
then you have the big climb up to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.660 
then you have the big climb up to
Columbine<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.360> also<00:03:47.630> want<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.990> know<00:03:48.670> with

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
Columbine so you also want to know with

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.160 
Columbine so you also want to know with
the<00:03:49.820> bottle<00:03:50.120> layout<00:03:50.450> okay<00:03:50.750> that's<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:51.080> to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
the bottle layout okay that's going to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.680 
the bottle layout okay that's going to
be<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:51.440> more<00:03:51.800> than<00:03:51.980> an<00:03:52.130> hour<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.790> what<00:03:53.330> do<00:03:53.570> you

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
be like more than an hour so what do you

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.000 
be like more than an hour so what do you
want<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.020> there<00:03:54.200> in<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.500> bottles<00:03:54.830> or

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
want to have there in the bottles or

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:07.610 
want to have there in the bottles or
just<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.670> see<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:55.910> graphically
