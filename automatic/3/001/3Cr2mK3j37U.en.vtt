00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.560 
is going to hit multiple enemies and
also<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.490> extra<00:02:15.880> sword<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.360> just

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
also that that extra sword that just

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.560 
also that that extra sword that just
popped<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.110> are<00:02:17.530> also<00:02:17.740> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> mimic<00:02:18.370> any

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
popped out are also going to mimic any

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.110 
popped out are also going to mimic any
weapon<00:02:19.570> attacks<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:21.100> including<00:02:21.610> if

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
weapon attacks that I do including if

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.900 
weapon attacks that I do including if
they<00:02:22.270> hit<00:02:22.390> double<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:24.220> very<00:02:24.370> useful<00:02:24.880> for

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
they hit double so it's very useful for

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.900 
they hit double so it's very useful for
for<00:02:25.840> blood<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:27.430> you're<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.790> get<00:02:27.850> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
for blood because you're going to get a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.750 
for blood because you're going to get a
lot<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> health<00:02:28.330> back<00:02:28.600> as<00:02:28.870> well<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.740> if<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.580> saw

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
lot of health back as well as if you saw

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.340 
lot of health back as well as if you saw
my<00:02:30.910> health<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:31.390> took<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.660> four<00:02:31.930> enemies

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350

five six hundred health and burned one
cool<00:02:39.070> down<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.390> wasn't<00:02:40.750> bad<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.440> most

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
cool down so it wasn't bad and most

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.000

cool<00:02:45.280> downs<00:02:45.520> are<00:02:45.670> very<00:02:45.850> simple<00:02:46.480> easy<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.930> they

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
cool downs are very simple easy and they

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.960 
cool downs are very simple easy and they
are<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:47.740> much<00:02:47.950> back<00:02:48.010> by<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.550> time<00:02:48.790> you

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970
