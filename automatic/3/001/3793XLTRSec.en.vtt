00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.310
 the series is the current middle one 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.509
 wheel loader series from volvo the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.099
 manufacturer promises some 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.370
 improvements in productivity 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.349
 and raced loudly before the l 250 g 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.570
 volvo industry first stock in the 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.730
 35 tons of weight he should 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.770
 especially to 40 tons of dump trucks and 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 Common street trucks fit well 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.029
 What benefits does it offer the user 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.369
 actually have this machine stop 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.160
 built for in this heavy use in 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.899
 quarries high from brechts forces where 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.679
 high breakout forces are required 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.729
 therefore equipped with a theme 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.819
 we want the 40th with this machine 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:46.699
 tons of dump trucks with four loading cycles 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:50.629
 load and on the other side the 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.699
 Normal road trucks in three charging cycles 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.850
 This machine is loaded with one 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.600
 volvo 13 liter engine has equipped 290 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.079
 kw performance is according to the new 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.699
 mother exhaust limits built at this 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.979
 machine we have in ours 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.590
 drive train our optical system 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.930
 also installed if the font is 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.909
 on the one hand a converter 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 Bridging it in the second third 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.609
 and fourth gear and combined 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.030
 with reverse at break the words by brick 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.759
 is a patent of us means 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.490
 automatically applying brake 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.340
 direction change 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.799
 So we have one first 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.999
 relief for the driver and on the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.280
 other side less stress throughout 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:43.520
 force less stress in the process 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.039
 Transformers and ultimately that leads to it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.490
 that we also save fuel 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.249
 we also changed the gas pedal 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.819
 we have a resistance in this 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:02:00.079
 gas demand you feel this resistance 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.450
 at about 1605 to the engine revolutions the 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.499
 we are also enough for normal work 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.869
 perform 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.600
 yes also with this machine as an option 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.640
 also our cdc a joystick steering 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.860
 that means we have in this 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.050
 machine an electrohydraulic front 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.120
 control in this way well 30 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.340
 We have integrated a control system 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.240
 automatic scoop recycling we 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.920
 have integrated this return to dig 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.060
 automatic lowering of the scaffold 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.860
 a certain preset lift height 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.840
 and hub height limit and that is 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.450
 Everything from the cabin is simple 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.290
 to adjust for the driver 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.740
 a very high driving comfort driving comfort 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.740
 to have 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.730
