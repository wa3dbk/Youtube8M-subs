00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 Gifts point tv I have you this time 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.400
 special gifts that brought 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 he might not be the same 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880
 it comes down to it that it at all 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.160
 give as is who of you would 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.839
 give away a foot people voluntarily 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 Of course, the whole thing looks a little bit 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.100
 different if the doormat like a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 pokerface star did and the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 name of the gift or family 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.580
 name says it will be right 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.429
 cool because the doormat is pretty 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.170
 big she is 70 centimeters wide 50 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.930
 centimeters high you can sometimes something 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 Greater feet on it and what 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.750
 really nice is the doormat has one 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 rubberized back 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.590
 so the doormat does not slip 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 open tiles or on the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 laminate floor back and forth yes what happens 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 Of course if you use the doormat 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 I transfer something but no 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 problem is because the doormat you can 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.039
 at 40 degrees just in the washing machine 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 Wash it and then you will see it completely 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.059
 just like they are here now 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
