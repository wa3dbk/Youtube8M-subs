 and no special place 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.430
 you follow the phase until you reach the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.430
 entrance to the temple of croco then you go 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.790
 have these enemies running in your 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 direction you kill only the enemies that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 run towards you you do not kill the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 other enemies enemy friends who 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.970
 do not kill with the limits 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 who are shooting mate only the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.130
 enemies racing towards you as 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.960
 You are seeing in the video after 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.530
 You killed all the enemies that run in the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.049
 your direction is between 20 and 30 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.750
 enemies you leave the other enemies 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.540
 to kill you give the lead in the area 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.689
 How did you see me doing how to do it? 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.020
 again you die of the main 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.689
 around enemies and continues to do 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
 this until you get the number of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.799
 items you do not want to have to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.750
 worry about picking up items before 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.489
 You die, because then you come back. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.819
 after the main items are 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.959
 remain on the ground so do not 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.629
 worry wick without problem but not 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.909
 Kill the shooting enemies I repeat 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.439
 do not kill the enemies who shoot because 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.139
 if you kill them you will lose 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.389
 checkpoints in front of the door then 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.760
 kill the enemies who shoot mate only 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.980
 links that runs in your direction but this 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.260
