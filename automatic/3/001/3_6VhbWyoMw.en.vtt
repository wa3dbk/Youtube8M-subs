I've<00:00:37.140> been<00:00:37.290> using<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.770> benefit<00:00:38.190> push-up

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I've been using the benefit push-up

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
I've been using the benefit push-up
liner<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.719> cool<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.200> gel<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
liner which is really cool it's a gel in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
liner which is really cool it's a gel in
a<00:00:40.980> pen<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.879> rather<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.329> having<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
a pen so rather than having to use a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
a pen so rather than having to use a
little<00:00:44.250> pot<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> gel<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> brush<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> apply

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it it's all in an easy to use pen so you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
it it's all in an easy to use pen so you
just<00:00:50.160> click<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.030> gel<00:00:51.300> comes<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> tip<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
just click the gel comes out the tip you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
just click the gel comes out the tip you
apply<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.180> keep<00:00:54.539> dipping

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
apply it you don't have to keep dipping

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.240 
apply it you don't have to keep dipping
your<00:00:55.469> brush<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.280> find<00:00:57.000> sometimes<00:00:57.210> with

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
your brush in I find sometimes with

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
your brush in I find sometimes with
brush<00:00:59.250> applicators<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.390> doesn't<00:01:00.719> always<00:01:00.840> give

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
brush applicators it doesn't always give

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
brush applicators it doesn't always give
the<00:01:01.440> smoothest<00:01:01.859> cleanest<00:01:02.309> line<00:01:02.550> sometimes

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the smoothest cleanest line sometimes

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329 
the smoothest cleanest line sometimes
one<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.989> bristle<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> brush<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> sticking

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
one one bristle the brush is sticking

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.620 
one one bristle the brush is sticking
out<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> little

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
out and then you get you know a little

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
out and then you get you know a little
bit<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
bit up here a little bit down there and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
bit up here a little bit down there and
I<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:09.000> find<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> doesn't<00:01:09.600> give<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I just find it doesn't give the the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.850 
I just find it doesn't give the the
cleanest<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> love<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.350> push-up

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cleanest look so I love that the push-up

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
cleanest look so I love that the push-up
liner<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.820> dark<00:01:15.409> pigmentation

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
liner has the really dark pigmentation

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.670 
liner has the really dark pigmentation
super<00:01:17.340> black<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.960> gel<00:01:19.200> liner

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
super black look of a gel liner

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.710 
super black look of a gel liner
but<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.759> append<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.810> let's<00:01:22.530> jump<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
but it's an append so let's jump into it

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
but it's an append so let's jump into it
okay<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> start<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.310> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
okay so we are going to start off with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
okay so we are going to start off with
the<00:01:27.119> benefit<00:01:27.930> they're<00:01:28.320> real<00:01:28.350> push-up<00:01:29.159> liner

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
the benefit they're real push-up liner
which<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.479> gel<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> pen<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
which is the gel in a pen that I was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.149 
which is the gel in a pen that I was
talking<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.520> earlier<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.770> because<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:34.950> eyes

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
talking about earlier so because my eyes

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.960 
talking about earlier so because my eyes
are<00:01:35.549> closed<00:01:36.060> set<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.780> generally<00:01:37.680> only<00:01:37.729> line<00:01:38.729> my

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
are closed set I generally only line my

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.060 
are closed set I generally only line my
eye<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> middle<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> outwards

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
eye from the middle to the outwards

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
eye from the middle to the outwards
corner<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> find<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.720> line<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.649> way

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
corner I find if I line all the way

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
corner I find if I line all the way
across<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.670> inner<00:01:44.850> corner<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> way

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
across from my inner corner all the way

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.429 
across from my inner corner all the way
out<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:47.450> closes<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.659> eye<00:01:48.689> off<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
out it actually closes my eye off and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
out it actually closes my eye off and
makes<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.829> appear<00:01:50.130> smaller<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
makes it appear smaller so you have a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.190 
makes it appear smaller so you have a
smaller<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.909> close-set<00:01:53.909> eyes<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
smaller or close-set eyes this is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380 
smaller or close-set eyes this is
definitely<00:01:55.500> better<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.820> once<00:01:57.240> I've

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
definitely better for you so once I've

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.319 
definitely better for you so once I've
done<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.710> corner<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.280> eye<00:01:59.329> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
done that I use the corner of my eye to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.780 
done that I use the corner of my eye to
the<00:02:00.659> end<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.469> eyebrow<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.189> guideline<00:02:02.759> for

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the end of my eyebrow as a guideline for

the end of my eyebrow as a guideline for
weird<00:02:03.270> put<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> wing<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> once<00:02:04.950> I've<00:02:05.100> done

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
weird put the wing and once I've done

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.580 
weird put the wing and once I've done
that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> try<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.229> fill

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that I go back in and try to just fill

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
that I go back in and try to just fill
in<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.890> close<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> possibly<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
in as close as I possibly can to the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.790 
in as close as I possibly can to the
lashline

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
lashline

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.500 
lashline
this<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.340> definitely<00:02:12.820> not<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> foolproof

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this is definitely not a foolproof

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.020 
this is definitely not a foolproof
method<00:02:14.320> as<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.160> there's<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.670> little

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
method as you can see there's a little

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.270 
method as you can see there's a little
bit<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.270> gel<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.110> crumbled<00:02:17.470> off<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
bit of gel that crumbled off there I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.980 
bit of gel that crumbled off there I
mean<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.910> definitely<00:02:19.090> not<00:02:19.600> going<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> be

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
mean it's definitely not going to be

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.380 
mean it's definitely not going to be
perfect<00:02:20.410> every<00:02:20.680> time<00:02:20.710> but<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.790> me<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.210> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
perfect every time but for me this is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.480 
perfect every time but for me this is
the<00:02:22.420> method<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.080> works<00:02:23.470> best<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.340> does

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
the method that works best and it does

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.860 
the method that works best and it does
require<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.850> little<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.330> work<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.660> some

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
require a little bit of work and some

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.020 
require a little bit of work and some
touch-ups<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.560> overall<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.370> think<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.850> turned

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
touch-ups but overall I think it turned

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.580 
touch-ups but overall I think it turned
out<00:02:28.120> okay<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.730> my<00:02:30.940> second<00:02:31.480> eye<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:32.380> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
out okay so for my second eye this is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.770 
out okay so for my second eye this is
always<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.340> trickier<00:02:33.760> one<00:02:34.000> because<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.750> only

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
always the trickier one because not only

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.960 
always the trickier one because not only
are<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.380> trying<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.830> line<00:02:36.100> your<00:02:36.280> eye<00:02:36.310> but

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
are you trying to line your eye but

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.420 
are you trying to line your eye but
you're<00:02:37.120> also<00:02:37.300> trying<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.870> match<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:39.220> your

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
you're also trying to match it to your

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.130 
you're also trying to match it to your
other<00:02:39.580> eye<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.150> you're<00:02:40.480> trying<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.810> make<00:02:40.990> them

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
other eye so you're trying to make them

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.020 
other eye so you're trying to make them
look<00:02:41.170> symmetrical<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.310> sometimes<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.820> wings

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
look symmetrical and sometimes the wings

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.300 
look symmetrical and sometimes the wings
don't<00:02:43.270> always<00:02:43.480> work<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.900> way<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
don't always work out that way and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.550 
don't always work out that way and
that's<00:02:45.520> fine<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.630> wipe<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.110> off<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
that's fine you can just wipe it off and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.290 
that's fine you can just wipe it off and
start<00:02:47.770> over<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.400> again<00:02:48.640> I'm<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.180> go

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
start over but again I'm going to go

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.450 
start over but again I'm going to go
from<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.990> corner<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.590> my<00:02:50.830> eye<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.040> outer

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
from the corner of my eye the outer

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.840 
from the corner of my eye the outer
corner<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.560> edge<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.950> my<00:02:54.070> eyebrow<00:02:54.490> and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
corner up to the edge of my eyebrow and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.720 
corner up to the edge of my eyebrow and
then<00:02:55.660> go<00:02:55.840> back<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.500> fill<00:02:56.890> as<00:02:57.160> close<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
then go back in and fill as close to the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.170 
then go back in and fill as close to the
lashline<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.930> get<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> realized<00:03:00.730> at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
lashline as I can get so I realized at

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.600 
lashline as I can get so I realized at
this<00:03:01.600> point<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.620> haven't<00:03:03.070> pushed<00:03:03.370> up

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
this point that I haven't pushed up

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.230 
this point that I haven't pushed up
enough<00:03:04.060> gel<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> pen<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:06.100> that's<00:03:07.060> why<00:03:07.150> I'm

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
enough gel in the pen so that's why I'm

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.430 
enough gel in the pen so that's why I'm
having<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.540> little<00:03:07.630> bit<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.930> trouble<00:03:08.110> here<00:03:08.410> I

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
having a little bit of trouble here I

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.170 
having a little bit of trouble here I
realized<00:03:08.920> afterwards<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.670> definitely<00:03:10.060> should

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
realized afterwards I definitely should

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.060 
realized afterwards I definitely should
have<00:03:10.300> done<00:03:10.480> one<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:10.960> two<00:03:11.110> more<00:03:11.260> twists<00:03:11.920> and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
have done one or two more twists and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.490 
have done one or two more twists and
would<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.060> had<00:03:13.210> enough<00:03:13.660> product<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.110> fill<00:03:14.380> in

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
would have had enough product to fill in

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.320 
would have had enough product to fill in
my<00:03:14.590> eye<00:03:14.620> completely<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:15.760> that's<00:03:16.120> neither

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
my eye completely but that's neither

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.410 
my eye completely but that's neither
here<00:03:16.510> nor<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.910> pretty<00:03:19.209> much

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
here nor there and that is pretty much

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.720 
here nor there and that is pretty much
it<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.290> like<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.709> video<00:03:20.920> please<00:03:21.280> give<00:03:21.400> it
