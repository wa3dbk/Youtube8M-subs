00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.940
 let's put a pot with water and let's go 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.880
 to put another container inside this is 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.150
 called Mary's Bath this is to avoid 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.650
 that the chocolate burns and we're going to 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:34.340
 use 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:37.010
 70 74 percent chocolate bars 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.770
 notice this is pure chocolate does not carry 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:46.820
 sugar additives or other things 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:50.420
 we can also use 90% chocolate 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.200
 and I think there's 99% too if you 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.540
 they do not like it too bitter they can 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.530
 add your own whole sugar but 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.550
 too little to maintain the nutrients of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.050
 your chocolate when we add sugar 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.630
 sometimes many nutrients are lost 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.080
 but by adding sweet nuts like 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.690
 are the plums or the apricots 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.940
 you are going to have the fruit candy 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:25.710
 without having to add more sugar 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 let's cut into pieces 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 as it is pure chocolate it is a little parched 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.909
 so I use to put the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.880
 equivalent of a teaspoon of 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 butter or margarine margarines 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.100
 they are very bad because by adding them in 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.729
 hydrogenated fats so they put a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.039
 teaspoon of butter so that your 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.020
 blend is softer if they do not have 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.649
 problems of acne or cholesterol 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 can add more butter I do not 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 I have no cholesterol problem but 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.340
 I do not like excess fat either 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.630
 I do not say that I do not eat fats like 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.350
 quite but in its proper measure 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.540
 while the chocolate melts I'm going 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.490
 to show how they can do to have 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.270
 I'm going to make some small bars 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.340
 because they are for a little gift and look 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.849
 to put the fruits first in each mold 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.470
 the truth that I do not know if they will reach me 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.800
 the chocolate because I have not done much 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800
 quantity 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.970
 try to make two decades 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.409
 the seeds of 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 there are sunflower seeds forgiveness that to 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 Sometimes I remember the words but in 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.890
 French, I have taken them a bit because 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.710
 thus they are better integrated with chocolate 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.400
 let's take a little 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.400
 in each 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.470
 in each space and the powder of 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.840
 hazelnuts 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.740
 these are toasted hazelnuts that give a 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.740
 very rich flavor 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.840
 when your chocolate is already melted 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.580
 mixing a bit to integrate well the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.720
 Butter 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.720
 we mix like this 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.360
 and we have our chocolate ready 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.040
 melted now to pass it I have 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.370
 preferred to make chocolates 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.490
 small to prevent my neighbor eat 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.730
 much 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:13.140
 now we throw the mixture 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.140
 in each mold 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.880
 a little bit to shape 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.960
 we miss the other one I already have all my 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.340
 filled molds and now removes a 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.240
 little for what 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.240
 mix well 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.560
 and I stayed 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.560
 more flat above 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.880
 and when they have done this, and only 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.430
 it is that they let it cool 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.810
 and later 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.840
 to enjoy it rather to taste them 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.840
 those who have ground granites 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.780
 mix well to integrate ay 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.889
 sorry 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.499
 mix them 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.770
 so that they integrate well in all the 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:11.770
 chocolate 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.420
 If they are in a hurry to eat them, they can 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.650
 put in the fridge for a while until it 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.650
 have hardened this is very good for 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.290
 give it to your children because that gives them 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.710
 will give a lot of energy is going to bring 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.540
 many minerals vitamins and what's good is 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.810
 that they will not get used to things 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.800
 candy so you can do it like you 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 I showed in some small mold 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.990
 to prevent children from eating 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.840
 too much chocolate because when you 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.520
 hook up I know I can be one 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.690
 become addicted 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.550
 and well this has been the advice of the 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.830
 eco-friendly 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.400
 until next time 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.400
 bye 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.660
