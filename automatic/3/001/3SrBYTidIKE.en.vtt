00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hello and welcome to discs that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.769
 I am I have a penis time your 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.809
 professor of biology and today 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.690
 we're going to see the motor arts and the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 motor message which first thing we 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 let's actually see how the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 researchers have determined which are the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.830
 motor arts so they did it thanks 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 to a technique that is called related to the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 sea ​​or resonance imaging 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 functional magnetic 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 so this irm there is an image that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.920
 so has an irm and so the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 protocol associated with this method 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.860
 of imagery was at first 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 will ask about staying in the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 scanner we will scan its activity 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 brain resting and then ask again 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 to move your hand and when it will move 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 the hand have earned no one will be scanning his 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.180
 brain activity 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.239
 then we will just have to do the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 contrast between the two scans and this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.700
 we will determine the tunes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700
 driving 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.110
 so looking for them 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.090
 evidence the different motor terms 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.960
 they realized several 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.840
 things are they are located 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.040
 mostly at the level of the cortex 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.060
 and they are also 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.860
 the opposite side of the muscle in action 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.910
 so this will explain to you later 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.910
 why this is the case 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.530
 so they determined three zones 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.150
 motor firstly the motor 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 additional above 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.370
 which is above the brain here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.670
 then the premotor cortex or their 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.950
 motorized us the pre- motor era the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 promoter who stands here forward 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.300
 in the frontal lobe and the motor cortex 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.910
 primary where the primary motor art that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.560
 is here back and in fact the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.690
 first two or two first bodies 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 text as you want are going to have a 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.810
 role in the preparation of the movement 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.890
 that is to say that you actually go 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 maybe not count but make a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.100
 movement was going so would 4 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 cup in front of you requires to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.619
 many calculations and is a task 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.810
 relatively complex that involve 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.850
 so at least two areas for the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 then prepare the time the cortex 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.020
 primary motor we go meanwhile 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.369
 allow the execution of the action and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.619
 so allow the movement so if they 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 have some Cylons pay this art 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.520
 primary motor and more specifically if 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.230
 we detail the different territories 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120
 of the primary motor we realize 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.680
 that in fact there are territories 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.140
 neurons inside some 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120
 primary motor that each have a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 different size and volume so a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.170
 number of different neurons and which 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.140
 are associated with different parts of the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.660
 body like here lips here mouth 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.610
 and the face here the hand and in fact one 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.049
 realizes on the basis we counted 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.850
 the number of neurons in these 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.500
 neuronal territories and we made a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.019
 figure called homom kudus 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.959
 engine this mockery this engine is 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.700
 represented here and so we can see that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.260
 the neuronal territory of the motor 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.299
 primary associated with the movement of the hand 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.799
 is much more important than the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.660
 territory neurons to the motor 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.660
 primary associated with the leg 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.540
 this being mainly due to the fact that 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.650
 well hand and had a body part of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.269
 our body that needs to be a lot 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.390
 more to have much more motor skills 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.510
 fine that leg is so this form 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.799
 This engine is also available for 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.209
 somatosensory air the army 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.579
 somatosensory that actually corresponds 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.450
 to the tactile sensitivity of 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.450
 parts of our body 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.900
 now we have seen how the air 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.370
 primary motor standards the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.560
 motor how the neurons of the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.340
 primary motor coded information to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.200
 driving 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.190
 so now that's your wife on our 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.599
 history although it comes to the level 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.330
 of its effector organ, ie the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.580
 muscle and this is done thanks to so everything 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.260
 a nervous system that starts all 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.870
 simply at the level of the monnerie this 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.400
 as we have seen 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.349
 neuron axons of the motor 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.239
 primary will come up to the level of 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.549
 brainstem where he's actually going to have 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.920
 tasting ie in fact the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.989
 Nerve extensions of neurons 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 of the motor will change side is 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.480
 to say that if the neurons was to 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.739
 left at the level of the motor they go 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.120
 spend their dive you go to 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.400
 right this is what explains the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.610
 results when we see an activity at 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.530
 brain level which is the opposite of the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 muscle side then it's 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.980
 extension axons water from the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.799
 air motor neurons are going to come 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.000
 connect the motoneurons his notes to 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.859
 neurons are the same as those 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 applied in reflex nota tic and so 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.780
 they follow the same logic ie 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.900
 that their action will come to the level of va 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.910
 is an extension to chronic valley at 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.440
 level of the spinal nose and then contact 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.800
 the muscle fiber and allow it to 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.800
 contraction 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.419
 that will be all for the motor arts and 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.889
 the motor message I hope that you 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.889
 helped very soon this speech
