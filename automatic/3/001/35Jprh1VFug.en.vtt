this<00:00:01.640> is<00:00:01.850> the<00:00:02.060> thank<00:00:02.300> you<00:00:02.420> ocean<00:00:02.840> report<00:00:03.260> algae

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
this is the thank you ocean report algae

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.650 
this is the thank you ocean report algae
are<00:00:04.310> little<00:00:04.670> plants<00:00:05.090> that<00:00:05.210> grow<00:00:05.390> in<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:05.569> ocean

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
are little plants that grow in the ocean

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.680 
are little plants that grow in the ocean
groups<00:00:06.470> of<00:00:06.650> them<00:00:06.770> are<00:00:06.920> called<00:00:07.130> phytoplankton

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:07.690 
groups of them are called phytoplankton

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.299 
groups of them are called phytoplankton
think<00:00:08.690> of<00:00:08.809> them<00:00:08.930> as<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.110> grass<00:00:09.559> of<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:09.920> sea

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
think of them as the grass of the sea

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.400 
think of them as the grass of the sea
but<00:00:10.639> sometimes<00:00:11.209> they<00:00:11.449> can<00:00:11.480> produce<00:00:11.750> harmful

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
but sometimes they can produce harmful

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.379 
but sometimes they can produce harmful
toxins<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:13.430> may<00:00:13.580> have<00:00:13.699> heard<00:00:13.879> two<00:00:14.090> terms

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
toxins you may have heard two terms

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.689 
toxins you may have heard two terms
which<00:00:14.719> refer<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:15.350> type<00:00:15.410> of<00:00:15.830> event<00:00:16.129> red

tides or harmful algal blooms they're

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.730 
tides or harmful algal blooms they're
both<00:00:19.730> used<00:00:20.179> pretty<00:00:20.480> commonly<00:00:20.929> and<00:00:21.259> there<00:00:21.589> is

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
both used pretty commonly and there is

both used pretty commonly and there is
some<00:00:22.130> issues<00:00:22.550> with<00:00:22.730> both<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:23.119> them<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:23.509> red

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
some issues with both of them so red

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.659 
some issues with both of them so red

more or less harmless their
discolorations<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.260> water<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:45.710> they're

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
discolorations of the water but they're

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.459 
discolorations of the water but they're
not<00:00:46.070> producing<00:00:46.430> toxins<00:00:46.989> however<00:00:47.989> they<00:00:48.260> can

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
not producing toxins however they can

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.860 
not producing toxins however they can
cause<00:00:48.710> skin<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.519> eye<00:00:49.609> irritation<00:00:49.660> so<00:00:50.660> there's

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
cause skin and eye irritation so there's

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.709 
cause skin and eye irritation so there's
increasing<00:00:51.379> awareness<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:52.850> surfers<00:00:53.539> and

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
increasing awareness that surfers and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.209 
increasing awareness that surfers and
other<00:00:53.840> people<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.440> are<00:00:54.530> using<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.859> water<00:00:55.129> a

other people that are using the water a

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.279 
other people that are using the water a
lot<00:00:55.489> are<00:00:55.879> actually<00:00:56.300> sensitive<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.929> these<00:00:57.050> red

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
lot are actually sensitive to these red

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.810 
lot are actually sensitive to these red
tides<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.679> can<00:00:57.859> develop<00:00:58.250> essentially<00:00:58.699> an

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
tides and can develop essentially an

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.540 
tides and can develop essentially an
allergic<00:00:59.059> reaction<00:00:59.410> dr.<00:01:00.410> Kadel<00:01:00.679> a--<00:01:00.710> says<00:01:01.039> red

allergic reaction dr. Kadel a-- says red

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.400 
allergic reaction dr. Kadel a-- says red
tides<00:01:01.850> are<00:01:02.120> also<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.480> source<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:03.109> food<00:01:03.350> for

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
tides are also a source of food for

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.590 
tides are also a source of food for
bacteria<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:04.790> we've<00:01:04.940> actually<00:01:05.150> been<00:01:05.450> able

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
bacteria and so we've actually been able

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.020 
bacteria and so we've actually been able
to<00:01:05.780> directly<00:01:06.320> connect<00:01:06.800> bacterial<00:01:07.400> infections

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
to directly connect bacterial infections

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.480 
to directly connect bacterial infections
in<00:01:08.180> humans<00:01:08.330> things<00:01:08.780> like<00:01:09.020> ear<00:01:09.290> infections<00:01:09.860> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
in humans things like ear infections to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.100 
in humans things like ear infections to
the<00:01:10.640> fact<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:10.970> there<00:01:11.120> was<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> red<00:01:11.420> tide<00:01:11.690> that

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the fact that there was a red tide that

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.020 
the fact that there was a red tide that
stimulated<00:01:12.710> more<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.220> bacteria<00:01:13.700> these

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
stimulated more of the bacteria these

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.430 
stimulated more of the bacteria these
blooms<00:01:14.360> come<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.750> go<00:01:14.870> they're<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.230> a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
blooms come and go they're just a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.590 
blooms come and go they're just a
natural<00:01:15.830> part<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.220> ocean<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.880> so

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
natural part of the ocean and so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.240 
natural part of the ocean and so
sometimes<00:01:18.020> they're<00:01:18.500> blooming<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.130> can

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
sometimes they're blooming and that can

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.430 
sometimes they're blooming and that can
cause<00:01:19.430> big<00:01:19.670> problems<00:01:19.730> we<00:01:20.540> oftentimes<00:01:20.930> wonder

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
cause big problems we oftentimes wonder

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440 
cause big problems we oftentimes wonder
well<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.860> get<00:01:22.040> rid<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> them<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.000> probably

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
well can we get rid of them and probably

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.000 
well can we get rid of them and probably
not<00:01:23.630> they've<00:01:23.990> been<00:01:24.140> around<00:01:24.350> for<00:01:24.620> millions<00:01:24.650> of

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
not they've been around for millions of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.220 
not they've been around for millions of
years<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.090> do<00:01:26.360> know<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.570> there<00:01:27.140> are

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
years but we do know that there are

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.620 
years but we do know that there are
certain<00:01:27.410> clauses<00:01:27.920> or<00:01:28.520> implications<00:01:29.330> for

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
certain clauses or implications for

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.240 
certain clauses or implications for
exacerbating<00:01:30.620> these<00:01:30.740> balloons<00:01:30.980> that<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
exacerbating these balloons that you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
exacerbating these balloons that you
will<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.910> if<00:01:32.150> we<00:01:32.360> get<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.720> right<00:01:32.930> condition

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
will so if we get the right condition

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.530 
will so if we get the right condition
such<00:01:33.740> as<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.100> lot<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.460> runoff<00:01:34.670> or<00:01:35.000> increased

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
such as a lot of runoff or increased

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.050 
such as a lot of runoff or increased
nutrient<00:01:36.260> pollution<00:01:36.410> from<00:01:36.920> humans<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.850> can

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
nutrient pollution from humans this can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.660 
nutrient pollution from humans this can
actually<00:01:38.270> stimulate<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.560> blooms<00:01:39.830> more<00:01:40.460> than

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
actually stimulate the blooms more than

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370 
actually stimulate the blooms more than
they<00:01:40.790> would<00:01:40.970> occurred<00:01:41.270> naturally<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.200> as

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
they would occurred naturally and as

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.130 
they would occurred naturally and as
such<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:43.100> become<00:01:43.790> dangerous<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.780> toxic

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
such they can become dangerous and toxic
