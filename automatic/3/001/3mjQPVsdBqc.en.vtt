00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
at a foreign one what I mean by four and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790

one is four yards off one yard outside

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
one is four yards off one yard outside
that's<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> pretty<00:00:32.579> typical<00:00:32.730> alignment<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that's a pretty typical alignment for a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's a pretty typical alignment for a
cover<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:35.130> let<00:00:35.790> me<00:00:35.880> tell<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.450> their

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
cover two now let me tell you what their

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
cover two now let me tell you what their
responsibilities<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.640> I'll

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
responsibilities are first and then I'll

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.080 
responsibilities are first and then I'll
go<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.960> identify<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:41.579> coverage

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
go into how you identify this coverage

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
go into how you identify this coverage
versus<00:00:42.660> other<00:00:43.020> coverages<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
versus other coverages that have a to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.729 
versus other coverages that have a to
safety<00:00:44.579> look<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> might<00:00:45.090> look<00:00:45.270> similar<00:00:45.739> his

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
safety look that might look similar his

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
safety look that might look similar his
area<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> responsibility<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:48.120> far<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.420> his

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
area of responsibility as far as his

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
area of responsibility as far as his
coverage<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> anything<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
coverage is going to be anything in the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
coverage is going to be anything in the
flats<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.149> he's<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.629> covering

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
flats so he's going to be covering

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720 
flats so he's going to be covering
anything<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.559> gets<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> flat<00:00:53.309> area

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
anything that gets in the flat area

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
anything that gets in the flat area
there<00:00:54.030> he's<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.989> covering<00:00:55.289> anything

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there he's going to be covering anything

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
there he's going to be covering anything
that<00:00:55.770> gets<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> flat<00:00:56.399> area<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.210> he's<00:00:57.809> got

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that gets in the flat area here he's got

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
that gets in the flat area here he's got
what's<00:00:58.289> called<00:00:58.530> half<00:00:58.920> coverage<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> he's<00:01:00.600> got

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
what's called half coverage and he's got

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.770 
what's called half coverage and he's got
what's<00:01:01.140> called<00:01:01.350> half<00:01:02.070> coverage<00:01:02.670> okay<00:01:03.210> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
what's called half coverage okay that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
what's called half coverage okay that
means<00:01:04.049> they're<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.409> drop<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.489> split<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
means they're gonna drop it split the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
means they're gonna drop it split the
difference<00:01:06.350> between<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> middle<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
difference between the middle of the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.140 
difference between the middle of the
field<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> sidelines

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
field the sidelines

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
field the sidelines
so<00:01:09.270> his<00:01:09.450> area<00:01:09.780> responsibilities<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> cover

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
so his area responsibilities is to cover

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
so his area responsibilities is to cover
from<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> center<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> field<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.659> over<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
from the center of the field or over the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
from the center of the field or over the
ball<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> side<00:01:14.189> lines<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:15.000> here

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
ball to the side lines over here

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
ball to the side lines over here
anything<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> gets<00:01:15.900> deep<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.590> that's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
anything that gets deep there that's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
anything that gets deep there that's
called<00:01:17.070> half<00:01:17.340> coverage<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.500> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
called half coverage now you do have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490 
called half coverage now you do have
linebackers<00:01:20.400> depending<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.210> front<00:01:21.509> what

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
linebackers depending on your front what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
linebackers depending on your front what
their<00:01:22.799> coverages<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.460> typically<00:01:23.909> hook<00:01:24.090> curl

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
their coverages are typically hook curl

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.190 
their coverages are typically hook curl
I'm<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.570> gonna<00:01:24.720> worry<00:01:24.900> about<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I'm not gonna worry about the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
I'm not gonna worry about the
linebackers<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> don't

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
linebackers right now because I don't

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
linebackers right now because I don't
use<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.689> identifier<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.680> far<00:01:28.890> as

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
use them as an identifier as far as

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.800 
use them as an identifier as far as
whether<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> cover<00:01:29.970> two<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
whether this is a cover two or not I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.980 
whether this is a cover two or not I
like<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> safeties<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
like to look at the safeties and the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
like to look at the safeties and the
corners<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.159> determine<00:01:35.549> whether<00:01:35.970> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
corners to do to determine whether it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
corners to do to determine whether it's
a<00:01:36.270> cover<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.079> determine<00:01:37.500> whether

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a cover two and to determine whether

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
a cover two and to determine whether
it's<00:01:38.820> zone<00:01:39.060> versus<00:01:39.479> man<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.350> here's<00:01:40.560> what

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it's zone versus man so here's what

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's zone versus man so here's what
we're<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
we're going to do it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
we're going to do it
receivers<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> quarterbacks<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.560> need

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
receivers and quarterbacks really need

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
receivers and quarterbacks really need
to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.040> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> identify<00:01:44.399> coverages<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
to be able to identify coverages the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
to be able to identify coverages the
same<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> identify<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> number<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
same way you identify the number of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
same way you identify the number of
safeties<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.590> thing<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.100> we

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
safeties that you have first thing so we

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
safeties that you have first thing so we
look<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.210> Samer<00:01:51.509> quarterback

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
look out there or Samer quarterback

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.929 
look out there or Samer quarterback
looks<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.829> sees<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.310> we've<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:53.670> two

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
looks out sees that we've got two

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.310 
looks out sees that we've got two
safeties<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.619> high<00:01:55.860> saviors<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.990> next

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
safeties to high saviors then the next

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
safeties to high saviors then the next
thing<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> alignment<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
thing you look at is the alignment of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
thing you look at is the alignment of
the<00:01:59.969> corner<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> corner<00:02:01.560> who's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the corner now if you see a corner who's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.550 
the corner now if you see a corner who's
aligned<00:02:02.130> outside<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> receiver<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.020> then

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
aligned outside of the receiver and then

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.679 
aligned outside of the receiver and then
his<00:02:04.770> eyes<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.460> looking<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
his eyes are looking in at the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.869 
his eyes are looking in at the
quarterback<00:02:07.079> his<00:02:08.069> eyes<00:02:08.250> looking<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.789> at

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
quarterback his eyes looking in at

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.859 
quarterback his eyes looking in at
quarterback<00:02:09.090> tell<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.470> that's

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
quarterback tell you one that that's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.869 
quarterback tell you one that that's
zone<00:02:11.080> coverage<00:02:11.620> because<00:02:12.010> he's<00:02:12.250> reading<00:02:12.730> that

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
zone coverage because he's reading that

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.850 
zone coverage because he's reading that
quarterbacks<00:02:13.390> drop<00:02:13.870> step<00:02:14.290> whether<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
called a funnel quarter which means that

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.059 
called a funnel quarter which means that
when<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.330> receiver<00:02:34.750> releases<00:02:35.500> he's<00:02:35.769> going<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
when the receiver releases he's going to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.970 
when the receiver releases he's going to
force<00:02:36.340> him<00:02:36.580> inside<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:37.750> he<00:02:37.959> has<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> safety

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
force him inside because he has a safety

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.820 
force him inside because he has a safety
over<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.250> top<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:40.390> could<00:02:40.569> get<00:02:40.810> over<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.620> top

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
over the top that could get over the top

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.039 
over the top that could get over the top
of<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.970> route<00:02:43.239> if<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.510> happens<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.019> a

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
of that that route if it happens to be a

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.809 
of that that route if it happens to be a
fade<00:02:44.380> route<00:02:44.590> he's<00:02:45.190> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> force<00:02:45.610> him

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
fade route he's going to force him

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.550 
fade route he's going to force him
inside<00:02:46.000> forcing<00:02:46.630> close<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.079> closer<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
inside forcing close to the closer to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.170 
inside forcing close to the closer to
the<00:02:47.709> safety<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.340> hit<00:02:48.519> can<00:02:48.700> play<00:02:48.880> over<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the safety so this hit can play over the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.690 
the safety so this hit can play over the
top<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.690> now<00:02:50.470> that's<00:02:51.130> how<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.400> identify

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
top of that now that's how you identify

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.970 
top of that now that's how you identify
a<00:02:52.150> cover<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.720> well<00:02:52.930> look<00:02:53.049> at<00:02:53.170> his<00:02:53.349> eyes<00:02:53.560> if

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
a cover to well look at his eyes if

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.410 
a cover to well look at his eyes if
they're<00:02:54.130> looking<00:02:54.400> at<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.549> quarterback<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
they're looking at a quarterback and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.809 
they're looking at a quarterback and
then<00:02:55.989> he<00:02:56.140> funnels<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.769> guy<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:56.980> mean<00:02:57.400> things

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
then he funnels this guy I mean things

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.970 
then he funnels this guy I mean things
can<00:02:58.060> change<00:02:58.090> post<00:02:58.720> snap<00:02:59.019> as<00:02:59.260> well<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.709> can<00:02:59.860> do

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
can change post snap as well you can do

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100 
can change post snap as well you can do
a<00:03:00.010> pre<00:03:00.280> snap<00:03:00.579> read<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.940> looks<00:03:01.120> one<00:03:01.360> way<00:03:01.569> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
a pre snap read it looks one way and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.660 
a pre snap read it looks one way and
then<00:03:02.200> things<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.680> change

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
then things can change

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.330 
then things can change
