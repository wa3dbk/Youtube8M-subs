00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.169
 The story about my tattoo is a very elaborate and intense story. 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:12.169
 It stands for all the things that mean something to me that I love and that touches me in the depth of my heart. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.170
 Before we started working, I talked to my tattoo artist for hours. After that we prayed together. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.449
 In total, it took 60 hours to complete 3 sessions of 20 hours each until everything was done. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.390
 And because we're talking about the history of the tattoo here: it tells the story of my life. About my development, a story bigger than me. 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.390
 The story of my ancestors and my culture, paternal and maternal. 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.170
 It stands for my African and Samoan roots. And for everything that is important to me. 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 Like the protection of my family, the preservation of the spirit of my ancestors. 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.740
 Also, my tattoos stand for the struggles I've overcome. But they also symbolize the appreciation of my achievements. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.490
 Like the sun that shines on the daylight shining here on my neck. 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.539
 And the "spirit of Puu Mana", which means "spirit of the flower". 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.539
 The flower in my story stands for a woman or the women who surround me. 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.840
 And I am fortunate to be surrounded by many strong women. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 As I said, the tattoo is very elaborate and detailed. I am very proud of it. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 But essentially it stands for three things: my family, the protection of my family, and my unruly spirit of struggle. 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.679
 Which I can only very difficult to tame. I will continue to fight and I will win. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 This part of the tattoo is right above my heart. 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 It's funny because a lot of people talk to me and say, you're still so young and you'll still have so much to talk about. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 Since I can only answer, I also have a lot of space on my body!
