00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.940
 hello how about youtube friends are my 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.639
 means a new video of the channel windows 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.940
 hack and this time I bring you a 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.180
 Real video how to make this button 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.010
 that is the button to get windows 10 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.350
 appear as it has happened to us 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.240
 several that we recently informative the pc 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.250
 where this button is appearing 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.770
 although we have already received all the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.870
 updates so without further by the 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.309
 moment we go with the intro and then they 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.309
 I will teach how to get the button 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.720
 go to the link that I will leave in the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
 video description 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 it's a mega link here in the link 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 mega the only thing they will do in the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.380
 true who to download is a file 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.450
 very light is 8 kilobytes as can 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.010
 see the download starts 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.470
 Well I canceled it because I already have it 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.320
 then you can go to the folder where 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 they have saved it 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.240
 in my case I have it here 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 and what are you going to click right and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.950
 they will execute him as administrator 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 wait here they will give a enter 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.890
 that they are going to hope they will give another interest 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 and here they will give you button 13 first 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.179
 h 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179
 of status 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.600
 is already shrinking 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.020
 It is worth mentioning that during this process 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.180
 if the button appears then 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.050
 they would have to cancel the process since 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.820
 if they could not damage the button then yes 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 while they are doing this process they 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.250
 it appears already done and already close 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.600
 this program and in case they do not continue 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.600
 all the steps to the end 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.769
 let's hope 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.990
 ok here as you can see it already tells me that 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.470
 the first update for the button 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.880
 is installed then that that is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.710
 I could say what is important and 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.540
 of we can give enter 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.930
 ok says that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.020
 no longer there is everything installed that already 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.020
 there are no updates 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.570
 for the center button and here what we're going 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.280
 to do is good there are two methods the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.890
 method 2 and the 3 good here is 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.260
 selected by number 2 and 3 that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.060
 actually it would be method 1 and 2 the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.320
 method that I recommend most and the one that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.450
 more button works is 22 and doing nothing 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.980
 20 I do not do it because as I already have the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.520
 button I did it before 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.920
 then you can not damage the button and 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.870
 after already a functional number in case 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.270
 that you do not work with the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.140
 number two that already comes to him and that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.200
 install them all that go to button 93 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.630
 good for the 13 button and also 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.110
 Andrew puts you enter and you give that 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.200
 sure you have to work 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.180
 then good then that nothing else 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.430
 already once they've done all that and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.640
 that the button had already appeared to them 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.280
 and nothing else was 53 exit enter and already 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.240
 it comes out in the good program they will already have x 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.670
 your button can now click 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.880
 and it will open what it is to get windows 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.880
 10 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.300
 and here already says that you can book your 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.540
 free copy and you can follow all the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.670
 steps from here shows you here 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.650
 you can have all the news 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.629
 since they arrived in an expert their 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.629
 things about windows 10 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.579
 and some of the subscribers have 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.340
 been wondering hey why do you 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.890
 come back to windows 8 as you can see 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.080
 is windows 8 if you already had the day is 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.790
 well I went back to windows 8 because 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.320
 the day is the truth was very unstable 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.320
 with my amd processor 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.000
 and it's going very slow they're running around there 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.920
 rumor is that windows 10 is more 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.680
 thought and more optimized for equipment 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.040
 intel later what I think can 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.800
 save 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.630
 well that has been all subscribe from 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.220
 like and more often will be going up 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.370
 videos because I already look like German 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.540
