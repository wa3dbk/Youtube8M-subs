00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello my name is jim pansa and you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.609
 see a call of duty comments 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 weapons and / or one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.120
 Weapons setup a compilation the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.370
 once sent me for the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.660
 call of duty ghost blood series join 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.490
 commander warriors in between always 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'll play the two with them 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 silencer and this fire quickly 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160
 or again dirt means that the balls 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.900
 stop being cut out even faster 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 and that with the wise anyway 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.420
 extremely fast fire 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.920
 but that should not be the case today 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.150
 this is now only on the edge 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.610
 again at the wise snacks 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 thanks for the setup i play 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.480
 in between, still quite happy 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.300
 However, I'm currently more at the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.930
 mtx landed so I really celebrate 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 And so a lot of good tear away so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.899
 people in the video by two different 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 things go first, yesterday I was in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.730
 Munich on the Titan full event and off 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 tomorrow from the 12 may then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.219
 Video material that we recorded 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.629
 I have already published 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 a lot ask if the videos 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.320
 come and yes there are several 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.199
 once with me and with commander 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 warrior at warrior he becomes so in the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 direction are a few gameplays with 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 a couple of heir explanation what you see 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.890
 what you can do a bit 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 feedback and criticism with me will be synonymous 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 Glocks to give so you have to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 Tomorrow in principle only the eyes open 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 hold off in the afternoon sometime it goes 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 then go and from 18 o'clock in the evening then may 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.990
 Video material will be published like this 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.710
 At least I saw that for me 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.689
 and read 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 that means in the afternoon there's the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.290
 first blocks from the actual event was 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 since it happened, etc. I think at least 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.180
 and in the evening it starts at 18 o'clock 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.299
 with the actual gameplay videos for 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 play info for you tomorrow from 18 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.689
 Watch gameplays full of me and deeds 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.909
 Of course, from many others 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.320
 youtuber have been on the start 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 I partly even with me again 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 hopefully link and then 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.470
 can you ever look like a good picture 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.840
 also playmaker important advance info 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.390
 It's not an open beta 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.799
 So I got the info back then 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.079
 yes it is an open beta is the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.720
 now it can mean no it can gamble 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.330
 No open beta you have to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.290
 Pick up aoki somewhere or apply for it 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.000
 or 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.800
 no idea so there was none 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.630
 information exactly so each of the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.700
 told you something about it now 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.990
 either new information or know it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 do not stop yourself and scatter 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.280
 somehow just rumored again 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 So official information as I said 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.790
 no open beta but it should of course 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.160
 as many players as possible 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.820
 Possibility to be given the game 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.290
 now to test once in advance 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.170
 We know what to think about it 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.610
 I think all the more I want now 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.110
 frankly do not say ingredients 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.280
 so if only you have this topic 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.900
 interested now directly 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.010
 switch off announced otherwise easy 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 to hear a little further 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.360
 because right now I'm so in a bit 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.070
 the restructuring phase mean something 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.580
 channel was quici xetra and so on 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.320
 As for 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.610
 i'm building a bit around i have 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.980
 a bit of a text screwed the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.690
 animals I'm just doing this 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.730
 Tinker some new ones for videos longer 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.870
 and also in the streaming area there 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.640
 I wonder what is there still such a 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.980
 I can and can do something 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.510
 looked at my last videos or 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.690
 the last streams still as 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.070
 video by witch are looked at what me 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.230
 liked and I do not think so 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.610
 yes and that goes in both 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 directions so i have for example 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.600
 seen that I often rock too much 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.360
 power or us in channels 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.130
 stop where too many people stop 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.190
 we can chatter and we have to 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.700
 future even a little bit stronger yes 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.050
 Respect and a bit 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 I still do not know how to confine ourselves 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440
 do exactly that or 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.030
 I know what exactly to do but that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.920
 I do not want to be like this here yet 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.580
 in any case, it is me 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.200
 noticed 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.430
 we already have five people in part 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.560
 given talk power and then come yet 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.480
 three four five additional channels in 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.310
 who then speak there again 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.890
 We must be able to stream at future 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.690
 make a little bit smaller than then 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.799
 are we honestly i could do that 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.180
 like to join others on twitter 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.769
 just on the top right then videos too 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 click on a channel and the last one 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.489
 Listen to things or look there it will be 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.720
 Sometime just a bit too loud and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.040
 a bit too stressful and then it does 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.700
 of course no fun there anymore 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.830
 to listen to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.120
 I feel that way and I know that 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.170
 many spectators also go so have the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.269
 in between, then in between 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.010
 complains and just have it right 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.560
 then it's just that's what it's like 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.299
 Just do not be in a high mood there 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.180
 I do not know eight nine or ten 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.939
 people 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.200
 they babble together to babble that 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.060
 we have to restrict a bit then 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.549
 I definitely want more in the future 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.750
 with a little better known youtube lay 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.189
 stream together in between 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.870
 I already have the first questions 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.639
 sent out or with 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.259
 a few people talked about it and you 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.330
 know how it is when youtube 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.220
 premature makes or there anyway strong 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.070
 is involved then the schedule 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.780
 always somehow yes I say so 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.220
 a bit crowded and of course you have to 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.530
 also take that into account 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.900
 experienced or bigger people then too 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.430
 in her i say own send 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.300
 Plans are not possible 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.349
 in between times a bit 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.789
 somehow fun 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.259
 just for fun just like we do here 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.940
 I always do that all the time and I have 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.349
 also understanding for but that brings 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.110
 me of course not really much now 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.520
 further forward that means I have got there 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.050
 already talked a few people but if 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.340
 I then slip in between us 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.900
 make that pretty spontaneous with the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.789
 this can be seen in the future 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.780
 I'll just keep this up now 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.910
 as until now 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.979
 otherwise I looked at how 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.139
 you joke a little more the 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.389
 it can encourage interactivity 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.800
 that it could give the possibility that 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.699
 I would like to then only at this place 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.750
 Do not promise that you have diverse 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.000
 little things have the possibility 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.470
 directly in the stream on to baptize message 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.419
 which one sends a certain address 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.949
 take away no idea maybe comes 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.120
 even another domain with it 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.440
 I am currently not as a 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.300
 real friend in front but just what 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.070
 the streaming I think it is 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.659
 actually a very cool solution right now 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.909
 for people like me this way 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.370
 between transition phase 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.199
 but never based on because of 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.639
 only who united has any 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.560
 rights that I find complete nonsense 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.870
 and totally over the topic 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.400
 I think streams always have to be clean 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.949
 stay and it always has to be 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.139
 possibility that all active yes 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.180
 can join quasi also with 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.919
 I want to play in the future like that 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.570
 have done something before what you have 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.639
 See which servers are playing 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.490
 can and that we could follow suit etc 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.590
 continue to bring forward so on this 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.729
 I do that I read the video 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.380
 now first in the name of the have 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.000
 starting from the one seen by the gameplay 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.669
 and right now the border had leaks 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.400
 and thus the whole thing is not too full 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.900
 is because the 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.729
 the criticism that I also accept 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.199
 want is that the videos in last 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.449
 time have become much too long so 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.430
 that there are always 10 12 15 minutes of videos 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.410
 and I want that too 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.940
 move slightly in both directions 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.350
 So that's for five minutes videos 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.900
 Already in this case there are almost seven 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.280
 minutes and there in the match against it but 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.350
 then a little longer things too 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.160
 partially then be 20 30 minutes long 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.199
 can 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.210
