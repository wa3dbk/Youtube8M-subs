00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.439
 welcome to the youtube channel of dn 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.939
 gamer point is in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.010
 teach how to get this view 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.080
 fonce caverns shark and puzzle 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.820
 what's next in the city of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 lion's bow for it what we have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 what to do is leave from the point of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 distant coast route go south 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 up to the stump mill once 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 let's get to the mill what we have to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 do is already the back and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 there we will find straw bales 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.839
 over which we will jump until we reach 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.580
 roof of the mill once we are 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.560
 here on the roof of the mill we have to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.650
 drop us into this kind of pantry 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 and go through this secret passage that 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.240
 it's quite hidden and it 's swallowing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 here comes another complicated part because 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.040
 we have to climb this slope 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.110
 which is a bit complicated and move on 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.260
 through the other secret passage through 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 here that is also a bit 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 hard to find like that at a glance 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 once we got here because we have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 continue to go up and and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 practically we are only us 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.059
 missing here take a few more breaks 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.229
 and we are already at the top of the view 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.229
 and in that way we get it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.930
 once we are here in the mouth of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 the jaws are from the mountain because we 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.340
 we drop we'll surely hear 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 voices that incite us to go down and if 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 we do well because we fall in the center 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 of water and we do not die 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.380
 well once we are here 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.200
 we have to follow the path here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.670
 that I do not remember where to go where 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.890
 I went the other time 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.320
 and bear in mind also that this area 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.290
 it's quite dark so at 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 you better have to raise the range to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.430
 monitor I think I'm right now 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.130
 recording on screen in small window 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.049
 so I do not see very well where is the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.390
 way but good more or less is for 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.940
 here at the beginning you simply have to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 follow the only path there are and sometimes 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.560
 so I told them on the way you go 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 listening to the voices of a ghost or 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.360
 something like that is telling you that they 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.480
 follow or something like that the voices are in 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 English 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.000
 once we got here we got to a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.250
 kind of labyrinth 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 what you have to do is here is a 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.160
 grotto right hand 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.900
 well you can also talk with the light 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.750
 strange that is guiding you theoretically 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100
 there is another here in front but there is another 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.800
 entrance here is the one you have 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.190
 to follow when you get here to the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.860
 Finally it seems that there is no way out 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.670
 the others but here tachÃ¡n 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.290
 it goes through the walls 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 if we continue here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.879
 where it was I think it was around here 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.400
 you do not have to pass in front of 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.980
 remains of the first officer yes and by 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.989
 somewhere it has to be the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.800
 one side to one side was going through this 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.470
 I do not remember where I was here anymore 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.690
 ok and here also there has to be 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.470
 another point where the wall is crossed 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.470
 here and we have finished the first 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.930
 part of the puzzle is worth now we continue 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.880
 going up and we are again where the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.110
 cavern of the beginning but we are in a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.090
 Upper level 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.300
 we have to follow the only way 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.560
 available around here 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.560
 we went through this cataract 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.959
 Be careful not to fall because if you do not 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.770
 you have to start over from below 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.370
 completely 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.720
 we jump around here now it's over here 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.819
 well once you get here that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.290
 there is apparently no exit what 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.230
 you have to do is jump on these 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.460
 small stones and in this way you are going up 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.030
 as an additional level 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.819
 and in this way then you go through again 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.159
 where was it here 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.280
 to these stairs and we got the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.790
 next to the next level of the puzzle 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.260
 this is a passage so to speak that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.870
 is full of traps this part of the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.999
 You can start it directly 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.430
 because we get to give good and some 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:07.549
 Yes, they come to give you spears 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.250
 and here be careful when you turn the 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.019
 tunnel the second time good if they make you 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.799
 a lot of damage to them between always 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.889
 between two thick torches regenerates what 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.320
 dark is what is good here a lot 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.720
 careful because there is a well full of 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.150
 skewers and here behind there are more skewers 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.759
 still 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.470
 but well this is nothing that can be 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.760
 solve with a speed increase and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.340
 taking a long jump 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.040
 Now here in this area, yes, you can 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.040
 give more to the two spikes but good is 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.290
 quite easy in general this whole area 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.120
 you have to be very careful you can also 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.790
 pass without much difficulty 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.060
 I tell you if they knock you down a lot 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.460
 pinchos whatever it is then between 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.450
 always between two dark torches a 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.450
 little and keep moving 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.470
 and in this way we have completed the 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.470
 second part of the puzzle 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.300
 well now we're still here and 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.390
 again we have to go up one level 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.010
 additional here when we mix let's go out what 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.790
 What we have to do is let ourselves fall 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.790
 this outgoing from here 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.610
 now if I remember correctly, we have to 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.320
 jump to that platform we have two 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.590
 platform jumping options in 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.930
 platform or I think here with 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.930
 an increase in speed should be enough 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.870
 and we went up this side of here 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.870
 we keep going up 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.370
 we keep going up this part is easy 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:48.229
 here we have a new part of the puzzle 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.850
 arrived at this point if you still do not 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.960
 you have put the range to the maximum 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.430
 you are going to have to put here 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.560
 apparently this is an area that is 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.530
 very well lit but when you enter 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.470
 in it, the light is turned off by the uncle and 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.050
 then every so often because when 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.810
 unless you expect it, the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.639
 light for a minimum period one thing 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.900
 as well as two seconds that I would give you 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.120
 time to jump from platform to 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.520
 platform however good at the trick 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.780
 we went to the range to the maximum as 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.220
 you can jump from platform to 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.650
 platform in a pretty way 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.199
 simple me here in the video what recorded 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.760
 to a mid-range and still good has 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.669
 cost a bit but with range to 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.110
 maximum you can do pretty well here 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.639
 what we have to do is jump out of 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.630
 pillar in pillar the falls are very 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.550
 easy what happens is that in a 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.729
 you see no cake until 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.050
 get here to the last pillar here 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.220
 well it seems that you can jump more 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.050
 above but really what we 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.729
 interesting to say until the structure is a 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.320
 the bottom wall that is where we have 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.419
 that to go one that we arrive here we have 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.190
 three options to throw ourselves into the water of 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.750
 left to right and center if you 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.400
 pull on the one on the left or on the 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.910
 center you will die so you go 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.970
 simply by the one on the right 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.620
 and you will fall on the water once 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.190
 let's be here then what you have to 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.400
 to do is simply go out by the only 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.250
 opening there and when you get here 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.040
 then you will find a chest and they will give you a 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.440
 achievement for having completed the puzzle and 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.880
 well then you can open the chest now 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.160
 I do not know if this is one of those that 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.230
 can repeat again if it does not work 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.590
 that was I got it and here you have then 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.990
 the captain is the ghost you were 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.180
 watching the voices and that he was guiding 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:28.380
 you have here also an exit by hand 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.260
 right that is a hole that there is in the 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.000
 wall and that is the way out 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.000
 quickly and where you will find a 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.850
 merchant offering yellow objects 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.360
 for level 40 onwards in exchange for 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.880
 karma I do not know if the corners also the 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.980
 Well, man asks you 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.420
 almost 10,000 karma points which is 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.500
 quite then how will you understand 

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.740
 Well, I have not bought the 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.780
 the weapons or the shields that he sells 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.990
 but well surely they will be 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.990
 less
