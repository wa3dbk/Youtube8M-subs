whole steps that way I can do a minor
third<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:35.840> get<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.080> vibrato<00:01:40.840> all<00:01:41.840> right<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.110> if

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
third and get a vibrato all right so if

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.010 
third and get a vibrato all right so if
we<00:01:42.290> take<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> look<00:01:42.830> at<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.100> bridge<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.780> see

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
we take a look at the bridge you can see

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.500 
we take a look at the bridge you can see
that<00:01:45.230> it's<00:01:45.410> raised<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:46.100> off<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.000> body<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.360> the

get a better look at it so you can see
it's<00:01:54.350> raised<00:01:54.620> up<00:01:54.830> quite<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> bit<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:56.920> way

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.260 

while<00:02:01.940> playing<00:02:02.440> jeff<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.680> not<00:02:04.640> only<00:02:04.820> go<00:02:05.060> down

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
and then there's a variety of other

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.380 
and then there's a variety of other
techniques<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.600> he<00:02:11.810> uses<00:02:12.430> he'll<00:02:13.430> play<00:02:13.790> with

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
techniques that he uses he'll play with

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.150 
techniques that he uses he'll play with

index finger somewhere near the tip of
the<00:02:19.100> bar<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.520> then<00:02:19.700> he's<00:02:19.880> picking<00:02:20.360> with<00:02:20.540> his

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the bar and then he's picking with his

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.770 
the bar and then he's picking with his
thumb

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.270

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.559 
and
and<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.570> way<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.960> either

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.150

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
like this where you play a note and then

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.470 
like this where you play a note and then
you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.810> use<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.140> arm<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you can use the arm to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.340 
you can use the arm to
to<00:02:49.379> create<00:02:49.590> an<00:02:49.830> in-between<00:02:50.310> note

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350

another thing that he'll do is he'll

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.990 
another thing that he'll do is he'll
flick<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.410> bar

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.980 

you<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.150> those<00:03:09.330> flutters

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.900 

and<00:03:17.990> I<00:03:18.560> want<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.830> show<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.610> have<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and I want to show you that I have the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.150 
and I want to show you that I have the
guitar<00:03:20.060> set<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.630> with<00:03:20.810> three<00:03:21.230> springs<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
guitar set up with three springs and the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
guitar set up with three springs and the
claw<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:23.830> relatively<00:03:24.830> far<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:26.510> would<00:03:27.260> say

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
claw is out relatively far I would say

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.460 
claw is out relatively far I would say
to<00:03:27.560> get<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> sort<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.610> floating<00:03:29.470> ability

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
to get the sort of a floating ability

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.070 
to get the sort of a floating ability
with<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.890> bridge<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.750> amount<00:03:32.990> of

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
with the bridge and the amount of

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.720 
with the bridge and the amount of
softness<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:33.830> need<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.400> certainly

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
softness that you need you certainly

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.310 
softness that you need you certainly
shouldn't<00:03:35.000> use<00:03:35.210> more<00:03:35.450> than<00:03:35.600> three<00:03:35.900> Springs

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
shouldn't use more than three Springs

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.440 
shouldn't use more than three Springs
now<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.400> use<00:03:37.550> two<00:03:37.730> Springs<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.360> then

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
now you could use two Springs and then

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
now you could use two Springs and then
tighten<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.840> Cline<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.500> little<00:03:39.770> bit<00:03:39.890> more<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
tighten the Cline a little bit more and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.410 
tighten the Cline a little bit more and
then<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.520> case<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.850> would<00:03:40.910> use<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.240> two

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
then in that case I would use to two

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.600 
then in that case I would use to two
outside<00:03:41.840> Springs<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:42.890> I've<00:03:43.010> achieved<00:03:43.130> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
outside Springs but I've achieved the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.500 
outside Springs but I've achieved the
same<00:03:45.130> flexibility<00:03:46.130> with<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.400> arm<00:03:46.610> using

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
same flexibility with the arm using

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.620 
same flexibility with the arm using
three<00:03:47.780> Springs<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.440> way
