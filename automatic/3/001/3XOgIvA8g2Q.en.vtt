literature yeah sure yeah yeah I am very
excited<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.820> put<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.260> am

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
excited to put it in there because I am

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.150 
excited to put it in there because I am
going<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.539> 2<00:00:30.539> volt<00:00:30.750> RC<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> signal<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> 7

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
going from a 2 volt RC a signal to a 7

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.240 
going from a 2 volt RC a signal to a 7
volt<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.640> means<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.390> able<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
volt which means that I will be able to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
volt which means that I will be able to
set<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.430> gains<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
set my gains up a little bit and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
set my gains up a little bit and
hopefully<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> signal

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
hopefully I can actually get a signal

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.010 
hopefully I can actually get a signal
gain<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.670> worry<00:00:41.910> about

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
gain and not have to worry about

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.130 
gain and not have to worry about
clipping<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.860> am<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.280> now

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
clipping as much as I am right now

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
clipping as much as I am right now
anyways<00:00:46.140> here's<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> before<00:00:47.190> video<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.850> I
