 federline in the ice mode it's a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.550
 attack that I passed the defense that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 was not very interesting scattered 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 voeckler after two beautiful attractions 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 same mode 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 we will see what we will succeed in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.160
 I hope I 'm fine 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.719

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.739
 above 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.379
 sometimes it happens and it's not very 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.940
 fun to be walked on 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.940
 apparently not open so I'm going 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 I do not like that much I see if 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.700
 I should have thrown me feeling where I 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.739
 know nothing and we see that touches 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.870
 look look I made a clip of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.840
 Too much the wall hiding we go the door 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.350
 from the garage suffers by here ok no 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.160
 problem to the consorts is doing well we are going 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.160
 do not pay for it here 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.150
 who is it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.150
 it diffuses I am discreet and machado 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 we will put on the moment 10 rebounds 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 to finance it come in there and block 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.020
 wahou fucking access I took 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.510
 the usual sweat a shot like vibe 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 can dream a dad wakes me up people 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.119
 do not know the informer when he 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.170
 have to go buy it and where we spend 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 no money in the discounter 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 rather spend some money for the spect 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.910
 weapon 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.150
 if we have plenty of source not serious laura 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.150
 sportback 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.500
 on having seen and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.549

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.130

 to six tales to agree we are still there 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.730
 the township thing makes a 90 + assist 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.440
 95 like that no doubt it counts as 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.840

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.850
 a few days for my break I covered 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.400
 the trick of dodging could not see 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.400
 I try to help with the recovery 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.230
 you do 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.870

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.980
 I'm going rather last week for the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.270
 just because we hear this 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.430
 bac and I have no interest though 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.660
 between them and finally here is when my base 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.370
 and I'm going to get violent and then to 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.340
 less if they want to catch the bp finally the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.840
 bpa goes to dpp because that's for the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.280
 it's all the same. 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.160
 these sniper facts elsewhere I know their 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.960
 will go there 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.610
 you worry my mouth I tapped 1,800 m 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.240
 for you ok so we'll put that 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.240
 the fire on the thing 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.010
 justice order to prevent the 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.180
 recovery we agree and who 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.180
 turn on we are 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.080
 we are a chorister she has him 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.670
 Perhaps death is still death 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.130
 recover the little one to serve chitika at 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:38.270
 beyond I do not care I understood okay 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.340
 but the idea is the recovery of 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.260
 n 1 that thing just right 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.150
 so I'm careful my ass you go 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.600
 to look for him right away he is 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.600
 behind in fact 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.030
 it's not the means it's there behind 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.670
 we must not let the stakes 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.230
 because after we get into shit 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:04.000
 I try a small burst I do not pass 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.000
 there ok 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.830
 3 the carnage over there falling his head 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.780
 wake up I do not know what's good 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.070
 good we are there are nine tickets left 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.130
 so a priori we won you I 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:22.780
 will not work sorry locals them 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:31.240
 pop up shop boys are the cobras ring 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:32.590
 it's nickel in the bowl all ok super I 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.170
 I'm fine here I do not know where it leads 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.919
 but I go there is not the right plan 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.410
 general to mount small double heads 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.700
 is good in real it was clearly close 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.190
 shackle of a tube you do not mount a 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.990
 thing like that in standby mode to hi I 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.500
 did not pass by chance because 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.240
 you do made in my garden he goes 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.919
 die not go him but yeah nickel 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.300
 excellent ben listens and I hope that 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.860
 this little video we will have more for 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.290
 the coup I did the taf on this range 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.190
 e 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.419
 we are just saying to ourselves 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.830
 soon for a new game mode and 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.730
 new maps all that all for 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.730
 down his fall
