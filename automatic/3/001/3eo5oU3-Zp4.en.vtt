all<00:00:22.450> right<00:00:22.600> so<00:00:22.780> we're<00:00:22.930> standing<00:00:23.260> behind<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:24.010> 98

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
all right so we're standing behind a 98

70 John Deere combine and I want to

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.550 
70 John Deere combine and I want to
spend<00:00:26.980> just<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.310> few<00:00:27.340> minutes<00:00:27.850> here<00:00:28.030> with<00:00:28.210> you

with<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.790> straw<00:00:34.180> chopper<00:00:34.210> I'd<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.380> draw

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
with a straw chopper I'd like to draw

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.890 
with a straw chopper I'd like to draw
your<00:00:35.680> attention<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:36.160> these<00:00:36.340> four<00:00:37.180> photos<00:00:37.480> just

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
your attention to these four photos just

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.070 
your attention to these four photos just
showing<00:00:38.680> different<00:00:39.220> challenges<00:00:39.850> as<00:00:40.450> a<00:00:40.510> result

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
showing different challenges as a result

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.049 
showing different challenges as a result
of<00:00:41.260> not<00:00:41.379> being<00:00:41.620> able<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.890> spread<00:00:42.220> residues<00:00:42.790> so

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
of not being able to spread residues so

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.450 
of not being able to spread residues so
I'm<00:00:43.420> not<00:00:43.629> picking<00:00:43.960> on<00:00:44.050> any<00:00:44.230> brand<00:00:44.620> or<00:00:44.949> type<00:00:45.250> of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
I'm not picking on any brand or type of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.970 
I'm not picking on any brand or type of
combine<00:00:45.879> within<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.330> series<00:00:46.570> but<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.470> combine

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
combine within a series but this combine

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.610 
combine within a series but this combine
as<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.280> can<00:00:48.460> see<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:49.210> not<00:00:49.660> spreading<00:00:50.050> residue

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
as you can see is not spreading residue

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.130 
as you can see is not spreading residue
evenly<00:00:51.220> across<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.580> head<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.059> wood<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
evenly across the head of wood and the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.649 
evenly across the head of wood and the
net<00:00:53.320> result<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:53.920> you've<00:00:54.129> got<00:00:54.280> heavy

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
net result is you've got heavy

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.299 
net result is you've got heavy
concentrated<00:00:55.659> bands<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:56.110> residue<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:57.129> then

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
concentrated bands of residue and then

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.369 
concentrated bands of residue and then
you<00:00:57.400> got<00:00:57.550> regions<00:00:58.059> with<00:00:58.300> no<00:00:58.510> residue<00:00:58.989> at<00:00:59.199> all

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
you got regions with no residue at all

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.740 
you got regions with no residue at all
so<00:01:00.010> regardless<00:01:00.550> of<00:01:00.850> what<00:01:01.089> seeding<00:01:01.629> equipment

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
so regardless of what seeding equipment

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.790 
so regardless of what seeding equipment
you<00:01:02.379> run<00:01:02.710> if<00:01:03.129> you're<00:01:03.699> trying<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:04.239> set<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:05.050> cedar

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
you run if you're trying to set a cedar

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.539 
you run if you're trying to set a cedar
to<00:01:06.610> seed<00:01:06.909> into<00:01:07.120> heavy<00:01:07.540> residue<00:01:08.340> compared<00:01:09.340> to

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
to seed into heavy residue compared to

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.969 
to seed into heavy residue compared to
no<00:01:09.790> residue<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.170> just<00:01:11.440> gonna<00:01:11.590> give<00:01:11.860> you

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
no residue then it's just gonna give you

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.740 
no residue then it's just gonna give you
a<00:01:12.010> lot<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.370> challenges<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.030> that's<00:01:13.120> that's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
a lot of challenges and that's that's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990 
a lot of challenges and that's that's
basically<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.680> importance<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.490> residue

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
basically the importance of residue

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.420 
basically the importance of residue

combine across the wait for the of the
header<00:01:27.610> okay<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.660> that's<00:01:28.840> where<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.170> starts<00:01:29.620> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
header okay so that's where it starts so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.210 
header okay so that's where it starts so
let<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.750> start<00:01:31.990> out<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.650> ready<00:01:32.950> cut

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220

this<00:01:52.330> chopper<00:01:52.720> will<00:01:52.960> do<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.110> pretty<00:01:53.350> good<00:01:53.440> job

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this chopper will do a pretty good job

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.220 
this chopper will do a pretty good job
spread<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.700> evenly<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.420> that's<00:01:55.570> important<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
spread it evenly and that's important to

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.500 
spread it evenly and that's important to
the<00:01:56.500> word<00:01:56.680> evenly<00:01:57.220> but<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:57.880> important<00:01:58.420> to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
the word evenly but it's important to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.350 
the word evenly but it's important to

and if you find one end or the center or
the<00:02:20.800> other<00:02:20.950> end<00:02:21.250> has<00:02:21.790> got<00:02:21.849> more<00:02:22.269> wear<00:02:22.599> on<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and then that gives you a good

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.310 
and then that gives you a good
indication<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.420> whatever<00:02:28.570> reason<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
combine like this is delivering more

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.680 
combine like this is delivering more
material<00:02:32.110> one<00:02:32.350> side<00:02:32.710> or<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> other<00:02:33.100> okay

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
material one side or the other okay

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.850 
material one side or the other okay
you're<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> combine<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.290> I'll<00:02:35.440> mention<00:02:35.620> in

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
you're the combine that I'll mention in

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.470 
you're the combine that I'll mention in
a<00:02:35.920> minute<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.280> delivering<00:02:36.670> more<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.270> end

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
a minute is delivering more to one end

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.500 
a minute is delivering more to one end
so<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:38.290> important<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.280> how<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.090> adjust

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so it's important to know how to adjust

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.920 
so it's important to know how to adjust
the<00:02:41.020> residue<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:42.220> any<00:02:42.400> combine<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.630> feeds

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
the residue on any combine so it feeds

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.410 
the residue on any combine so it feeds
evenly<00:02:44.620> into<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.130> chopper<00:02:45.520> if<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.000> feed

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
evenly into the chopper if you feed

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.720 
evenly into the chopper if you feed
residue<00:02:47.020> even<00:02:47.350> evenly<00:02:47.860> into<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> chopper

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
residue even evenly into the chopper

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.370 
residue even evenly into the chopper
you're<00:02:49.060> not<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.420> overload<00:02:49.840> one<00:02:50.140> end

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
you're not going to overload one end

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.170 
you're not going to overload one end
compared<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> other<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.910> will<00:02:52.000> get

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
compared to the other and it will get

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.750 
compared to the other and it will get
you<00:02:52.330> more<00:02:52.540> uniform<00:02:53.230> residue<00:02:53.920> distribution

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you more uniform residue distribution

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.060 
you more uniform residue distribution

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
ready cut machines also got what we call

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.060 
ready cut machines also got what we call
an<00:03:18.310> adjustable<00:03:18.970> tail<00:03:19.180> board<00:03:19.740> where<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.770> can

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
an adjustable tail board where you can

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.060 
an adjustable tail board where you can
raise<00:03:21.340> or<00:03:21.700> lower<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.570> tail<00:03:22.900> board<00:03:23.230> obviously

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
raise or lower the tail board obviously

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.730 
raise or lower the tail board obviously
as<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.730> raise<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.030> tail<00:03:25.480> board<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.260> spreads

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
as you raise the tail board it spreads

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.550 
as you raise the tail board it spreads
wider<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:27.910> lower<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.810> tail<00:03:29.050> board<00:03:29.290> it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
wider as you lower the tail board it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.830 
wider as you lower the tail board it
concentrates<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> spread<00:03:30.790> weight<00:03:31.030> into<00:03:31.810> a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
concentrates the spread weight into a

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.660 
concentrates the spread weight into a
narrower<00:03:32.200> area<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> nice<00:03:33.250> feature

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
narrower area so this is a nice feature

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.000 
narrower area so this is a nice feature
if<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.480> make<00:03:34.720> something<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:35.440> easy<00:03:35.740> to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
if you make something that's easy to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.040 
if you make something that's easy to
adjust<00:03:36.130> there's<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> good<00:03:37.270> chance<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.630> people

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
adjust there's a good chance that people

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.199 
adjust there's a good chance that people
are<00:03:38.110> going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.320> adjust<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.860> by<00:03:39.370> contrast<00:03:40.000> some

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
are going to adjust it by contrast some

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.120 
are going to adjust it by contrast some
of<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.360> factory<00:03:40.780> models<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.290> takes<00:03:41.560> wrenches

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
of the factory models it takes wrenches

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.060 
of the factory models it takes wrenches
sockets<00:03:42.670> sometimes<00:03:43.530> modifications<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.800> get

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
sockets sometimes modifications to get

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.250 
sockets sometimes modifications to get
it<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.370> spread<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.850> way<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.060> want<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.600> if<00:03:47.050> it's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
it to spread the way you want it if it's

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.449 
it to spread the way you want it if it's
going<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.410> take<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.650> lot<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.980> time<00:03:48.160> with

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
going to take a lot of time with

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.910 
going to take a lot of time with
wrenches<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.180> make<00:03:49.330> these<00:03:49.540> changes<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
wrenches to make these changes the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320 
wrenches to make these changes the
chances<00:03:51.340> are<00:03:51.490> some<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:51.940> operators

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
chances are some of the operators

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.790 
chances are some of the operators
probably<00:03:52.780> aren't<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.170> take<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.530> time

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
probably aren't going to take that time

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.610 
probably aren't going to take that time
so<00:03:54.459> yeah<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.850> lot<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.090> things<00:03:55.390> but<00:03:55.720> adjusting

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
so yeah a lot of things but adjusting

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.560 
so yeah a lot of things but adjusting
the<00:03:56.740> tail<00:03:56.950> board<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> direction<00:03:58.330> of

residue flow into the chopper are two

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.440 
residue flow into the chopper are two
real<00:04:01.530> important<00:04:02.530> points<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.160> spread<00:04:03.850> residue

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
real important points to spread residue

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.050 
real important points to spread residue
better<00:04:04.690> with<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> chopper<00:04:05.590> such<00:04:05.890> as<00:04:06.040> this<00:04:06.220> all

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
better with a chopper such as this all

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.580 
better with a chopper such as this all
right<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.300> we're<00:04:07.450> standing<00:04:07.600> behind<00:04:07.959> in<00:04:08.290> ninety

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
right so we're standing behind in ninety

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.260 
right so we're standing behind in ninety
eight<00:04:08.709> seventy<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.580> example<00:04:09.940> with<00:04:10.180> a

standard<00:04:10.840> sharper<00:04:11.530> tail<00:04:11.770> board<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:12.490> is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
standard sharper tail board so this is

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.310 
standard sharper tail board so this is
obviously<00:04:12.940> not<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.240> advanced<00:04:13.690> power<00:04:13.959> cast

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
obviously not the advanced power cast

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.170 
obviously not the advanced power cast
not<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180

that<00:04:40.570> measure<00:04:40.840> an<00:04:41.080> inch<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.500> quarter<00:04:41.740> apart

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
that measure an inch and a quarter apart

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.040 
that measure an inch and a quarter apart
the<00:04:42.880> ready<00:04:43.090> cut<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.630> showed<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> few

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
the ready cut that we showed a few

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.560 
the ready cut that we showed a few
minutes<00:04:44.410> ago<00:04:44.530> that's<00:04:45.190> 48<00:04:45.610> stationary<00:04:46.360> knives

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
minutes ago that's 48 stationary knives

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.440 
minutes ago that's 48 stationary knives
an<00:04:46.840> inch<00:04:47.020> apart<00:04:47.639> so<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.700> get<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> slightly

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
an inch apart so you get a slightly

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.980 
an inch apart so you get a slightly
finer<00:04:50.139> shot<00:04:50.710> with<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.070> ready<00:04:51.340> car<00:04:51.990> compared

finer shot with the ready car compared
to<00:04:53.200> this<00:04:53.380> one<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.070> if<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.310> want<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.669> chop

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
to this one and if you want to chop

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.800 
to this one and if you want to chop
residue<00:04:55.540> fine<00:04:56.160> then<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.760> tie<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.060> nice<00:04:58.389> knife

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
residue fine then the tie the nice knife

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.290 
residue fine then the tie the nice knife
spacing<00:04:59.410> is<00:04:59.560> obviously<00:04:59.919> important<00:05:00.580> but<00:05:00.760> don't

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
spacing is obviously important but don't

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.330 
spacing is obviously important but don't
I<00:05:01.510> don't<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.050> cut<00:05:02.260> residue<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.979> fine

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
I don't like to cut residue to fine

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.510 
I don't like to cut residue to fine
because<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.240> finer<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.780> chop<00:05:05.050> residue<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
because the finer you chop residue the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520 
because the finer you chop residue the
more<00:05:06.729> difficult<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.419> is<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.600> spread<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.290> now<00:05:08.410> on

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
more difficult it is to spread it now on

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.680 
more difficult it is to spread it now on
an<00:05:08.650> SDS<00:05:09.100> machine<00:05:09.520> you're<00:05:09.729> obviously<00:05:09.880> blending

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
an SDS machine you're obviously blending

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
chat with residue which is a big

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.210 
chat with residue which is a big
positive<00:05:13.300> because<00:05:14.290> it's<00:05:14.440> really<00:05:14.680> hard<00:05:15.010> to

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
positive because it's really hard to

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.030 
positive because it's really hard to
spread<00:05:15.460> check<00:05:15.910> so<00:05:16.630> if<00:05:16.780> you<00:05:16.930> can<00:05:17.139> blend<00:05:17.410> for
