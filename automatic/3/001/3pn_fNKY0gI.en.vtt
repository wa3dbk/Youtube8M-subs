00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.390
 in this tutorial i will tell you such basic 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.789
 moments a slight introduction to the ladies and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.890
 tell you what you get in 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.839
 principle of this course in this series 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.939
 lessons 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.100
 so the first moment you know what 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.380
 behavioral strategies will allow you 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.540
 solve almost all issues in 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.720
 relationship with your man is peaceful 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.000
 way further you get right here 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.910
 ready-made phrases and designs like you 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.770
 need to say you get what you want 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.380
 while the relationship with a man you do not 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.240
 spoiled and only strengthened the third 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.280
 the moment you will understand why men in general 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.490
 Frequently patient advice 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.110
 women are the fourth moment you find out 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.630
 what are the hidden mechanisms of the psyche 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.210
 our male heads work when 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.340
 you give advice to a man in a certain 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.720
 manner and finally you will find out what 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.909
 key point is always to be remembered 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.249
 to effectively impact on 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.070
 man but not harming your relationship what 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.179
 very often because 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.310
 working on a man in principle is easy 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.380
 There are many ways to influence 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.229
 the vast majority of them lead 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.240
 to the fact that the relationship is spoiled I want you 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.009
 tell how to make you 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.520
 could influence the attitude while not 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.009
 just not spoiled yet and improved here 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.609
 such an eye with you a small plan on 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.289
 this course and let us begin with you 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.990
 look as usually happens in life when 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.600
 the relationship gets worse then each side 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.200
 men or women all try 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 shift the responsibility for 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.139
 worsening attitude on his 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.319
 partner they say is he to blame or is she 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.209
 guilty and what causes it 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.119
 This is natural to the fact that men 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.670
 women's sites do not listen and why not 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.310
 listen because women are all these 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.289
 advice given in such a way that listen to them 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.470
 absolutely do not want to naturally and me 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.680
 I want to follow which is quite logical and I 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.260
 I'll tell you right now such a thing after 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.420
 which you probably all run away who 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.300
 where at least half of you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.830
 close and say well well of course well this is the same 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:29.300
 again we are to blame women are ready well 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 each of us be male or 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.209
 a woman should start work with herself 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.870
 the question arises 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.330
 who should start doing it first and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.430
 the answer is something stronger but who will be stronger 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.130
 and here is just what you didn't want 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.540
 would hear what work on yourself in 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.980
 the first must start a woman 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 why i say this i say it not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.660
 because I'm a man I'm so bad to me 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.280
 so comfortable there is no objective 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.560
 reality this is what is real in 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.959
 life there is this reality 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.480
 this is the law of life and they do not need 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.600
 neglect because a woman is very 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.430
 strongly emotional mentally not alone 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.060
 man no matter how strong energy is 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.370
 possessed 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.280
 I think you know yes he is close and not 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 worth even the weakest 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.329
 women let's say you know perfectly well and 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.790
 me and you are all men all other women 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.700
 what female energy has on men 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.709
 very big influence on just men 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.079
 paralyzing when women are something 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.700
 purposefully want to do when they 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.250
 affect it meaningfully on 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.739
 man and why am I talking about this date 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.329
 statements are very much about it 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.190
 filmed there hundreds don't know thousands 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.609
 movies tens of hundreds of thousands of books 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.040
 written about how a woman can her 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.590
 energy man and kill gave them how would 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.840
 one glance and also one glance 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.600
 in short, it can elevate to 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.570
 lift up to heaven practically and it is not 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.150
 metaphor because people are not metaphors 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.989
 addicted to people watching and reading what 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.340
 has a real background 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.880
 so this objective reality you 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.370
 should understand this so going back to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.709
 our such a baseline under which 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.450
 we will start to work 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.160
 above themselves first must 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.320
 woman 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.100
 if a woman will not take 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.900
 no action to improve relationships 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.340
 relationship nothing will save a man not 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.730
 save a relationship 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.530
 the more he does not save them alone you understand 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.550
 he can do nothing even if 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.979
 he really wanted 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.690
 but if you want to improve relationships 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.340
 if you want to learn to gently manage 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.930
 men and even improve relationships 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.940
 then a man will not be able to prevent you 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 he didn’t try he wo n’t be able to 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.210
 prevent and understand we live with you in 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.300
 world and national systems about this very 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.790
 often we all forget why there is 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.580
 here is a bunch of illusions why people lose 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.280
 time is the biggest illusion that people 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.830
 forget that if we have something already long 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.320
 did we have here that 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.540
 relationship of a certain type and so on 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.880
 we can't take it like this 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.700
 in a week in those even in a month 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.889
 turn around 180 degrees and that is all 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.990
 it was good this is the same as you 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.510
 driving along the highway by car to 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.970
 speed of 150 to 200 kilometers per hour and 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.010
 all of a sudden you decide here and so sharply car 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.419
 deploy you can't sharp 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.220
 deploy you can't dramatically 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.229
 slow down you need to smoothly 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.870
 brake smoothly change direction 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.690
 movements because if you do 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.120
 something sharp then it will be a crash it 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.400
 there will be an accident for your relationship for you 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.849
 and for your man you shouldn't be like that 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.010
 do again yes if you already 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.110
 formed a certain relationship 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.210
 a certain type of communication with a partner all 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.760
 it does not change by magic 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.650
 sticks you have it very clearly 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.440
 understand yes we are all here somewhere 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.849
 We understand new consciousness but do not accept 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.060
 we are always waiting for this magic 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:11.000
 transformations and the longer you drove those 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.530
 the higher your speed the more smoothly you 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.690
 need to slow down and change coming to 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.849
 relationship is just such a fright 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.139
 this way this way will help you 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.240
 really get good 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.760
 results 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.610
 what are these things that you wanted 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.979
 say in the introductory lesson so you immediately 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.050
 understood along the way whether you are with me or not 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.139
 yes do you want a magical transfiguration 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.360
 either you are ready to watch a series of simple 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.979
 how-to lessons and how-to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.960
 act according to them 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.720
 acts to gradually and improve your 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.190
 relations 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.500
 I hope that such a small 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.230
 preparation and he gave and already in the next
