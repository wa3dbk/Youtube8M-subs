00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
saving techniques in a home start out

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.840 
saving techniques in a home start out
first<00:01:55.780> with<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.289> installation<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.190> what<00:01:57.729> we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
first with the installation and what we

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.160 
first with the installation and what we
did<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:58.209> part<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.600> house<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.020> use

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
did in this part of the house is we use

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.300 
did in this part of the house is we use
what<00:01:59.350> they<00:01:59.440> call<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.709> insulated<00:02:00.039> concrete

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
what they call it insulated concrete

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.279 
what they call it insulated concrete
forms<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:01.270> all<00:02:01.450> these<00:02:01.630> walls<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.080> see

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
forms so all these walls that you see

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.260 
forms so all these walls that you see
here<00:02:02.440> are<00:02:02.590> solid<00:02:02.860> concrete<00:02:03.039> with<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.729> really

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
here are solid concrete with a really

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.760 
here are solid concrete with a really
good<00:02:04.420> insulation<00:02:05.050> which<00:02:05.259> helps<00:02:05.530> us<00:02:05.619> with

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
good insulation which helps us with

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.469 
good insulation which helps us with
their<00:02:05.860> AC<00:02:06.009> bills<00:02:06.429> so<00:02:07.000> we<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.209> a<00:02:07.240> wireless

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
their AC bills so we have a wireless

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.090 
their AC bills so we have a wireless
switching<00:02:07.990> system<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> house<00:02:08.679> which

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
switching system in the house which

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.130 
switching system in the house which
means<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:10.090> saved<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.630> lot<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.869> copper

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
means that we saved on a lot of copper

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.750 
means that we saved on a lot of copper
wire<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:11.590> upfront<00:02:11.740> costs<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.459> terms<00:02:12.580> of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
wire and upfront costs in terms of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
wire and upfront costs in terms of
installing<00:02:13.150> our<00:02:13.420> light<00:02:13.660> switching<00:02:14.110> system

energy-efficient<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.810> big<00:02:29.050> tank<00:02:29.349> here<00:02:29.650> is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
energy-efficient this big tank here is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.250 
energy-efficient this big tank here is
actually<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> rain<00:02:30.819> barrel<00:02:31.080> commercial<00:02:32.080> rain

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
actually a rain barrel commercial rain

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.350 
actually a rain barrel commercial rain
bail<00:02:32.500> which<00:02:32.800> holds<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.400> water<00:02:33.730> from<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> roof

bail which holds the water from the roof

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.619 
bail which holds the water from the roof
so<00:02:34.390> we've<00:02:34.750> got<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> series<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> gutters<00:02:35.740> that

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
so we've got a series of gutters that

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.759 
so we've got a series of gutters that
you<00:02:37.629> know<00:02:37.720> drop<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.140> water<00:02:38.349> into<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> rain

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
you know drop the water into the rain

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.110 
you know drop the water into the rain
barrel<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.129> then<00:02:39.250> we<00:02:39.370> use<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.760> irrigate

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
barrel and then we use it to irrigate

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.460 
barrel and then we use it to irrigate
the<00:02:40.239> landscape<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.049> side<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.319> house

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the landscape on this side of the house

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.210 
the landscape on this side of the house
we<00:02:41.680> actually

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
we actually

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.280 
we actually
southside<00:02:42.730> facing<00:02:43.180> south<00:02:43.390> our<00:02:43.630> solar<00:02:43.870> panels

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
southside facing south our solar panels

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.160 
southside facing south our solar panels
you'll<00:02:45.250> see<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.730> black<00:02:46.000> strip<00:02:46.780> up<00:02:46.960> there

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you'll see a little black strip up there

and<00:02:47.320> those<00:02:47.440> are<00:02:47.590> actually<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> solar<00:02:48.190> panels

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and those are actually the solar panels

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.880 
and those are actually the solar panels
that<00:02:48.820> provide<00:02:48.970> us<00:02:49.480> our<00:02:49.870> power<00:02:50.290> during<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.680> day

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
that provide us our power during the day

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.240 
that provide us our power during the day
no<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.730> think<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.690> important<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.980> aware

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
no I think it is important to be aware

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860 
no I think it is important to be aware
because<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.060> fact<00:02:55.270> that<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.660> save<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
because of the fact that you can save a

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.960 
because of the fact that you can save a
lot<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.080> money<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.470> way<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.890> everyone<00:02:57.730> right

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
lot of money this way and everyone right

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.360 
lot of money this way and everyone right
now<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.420> looking<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.960> ways<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.140> save<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.860> this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
now is looking for ways to save and this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.980 
now is looking for ways to save and this
is<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:00.940> way<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.570> save<00:03:01.780> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
is just one way that you can save and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.840 
is just one way that you can save and
not<00:03:02.080> only<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.410> but<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.490> take<00:03:03.670> those

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
not only that but you can take those

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.610 
not only that but you can take those
savings<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.420> actually<00:03:04.810> multiply<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.500> you

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
savings and actually multiply it if you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.050 
savings and actually multiply it if you
take<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.160> use<00:03:06.460> it<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.640> pay<00:03:06.850> down<00:03:06.880> your

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
take it and use it to pay down your

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.510 
take it and use it to pay down your
mortgages<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:08.260> money<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.980> we're<00:03:09.130> saving<00:03:09.310> on

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
mortgages the money that we're saving on

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240 
mortgages the money that we're saving on
your<00:03:09.550> utility<00:03:10.270> bills<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.680> know<00:03:11.710> helps<00:03:12.070> offset
