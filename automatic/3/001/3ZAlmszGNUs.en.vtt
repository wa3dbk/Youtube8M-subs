in here we have a nice assortment of
luck<00:00:38.160> worms<00:00:38.399> they're<00:00:39.270> usually<00:00:39.629> somewhere

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the way that we hook these worms is the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
the way that we hook these worms is the
same<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.510> hook<00:00:45.690> blood<00:00:45.960> worms<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.500> nuclear

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
same as we hook blood worms and nuclear

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
same as we hook blood worms and nuclear
worms<00:00:47.520> although<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> nuclear<00:00:49.020> worm<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
worms although with a nuclear worm and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
worms although with a nuclear worm and
sometimes<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> blood<00:00:50.280> worm<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.700> not

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
sometimes with a blood worm but not

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.029 
sometimes with a blood worm but not
usually<00:00:51.329> I'll<00:00:51.629> cut<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.320> half<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
usually I'll cut it in half to make it a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
usually I'll cut it in half to make it a
little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.460> smaller<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.750> we're<00:00:54.899> going

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
little bit smaller so what we're going

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.209 
little bit smaller so what we're going
to<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> we're<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> pick<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
to do is we're going to pick one of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.430 
to do is we're going to pick one of
these<00:00:56.280> worms<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.199> next

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
these worms out of here and the next

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
these worms out of here and the next
thing<00:00:58.590> we're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> we're<00:00:59.250> going

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.360 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> long<00:00:59.940> shank<00:01:00.420> worm<00:01:01.170> hook<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to use a long shank worm hook to make it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
to use a long shank worm hook to make it
a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.789> easier<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.480> hooking<00:01:04.019> these

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
a little bit easier for hooking these

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.469 
a little bit easier for hooking these
worms<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.979> putting<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> hook<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
worms and putting them on the hook and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.469 
worms and putting them on the hook and
also<00:01:07.409> these<00:01:07.860> long<00:01:08.130> shank<00:01:08.460> hooks<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.939> better

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
also these long shank hooks are better

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
also these long shank hooks are better
when<00:01:09.780> you're<00:01:09.960> using<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> whole<00:01:10.439> worm<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
when you're using the whole worm and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
when you're using the whole worm and
want<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> keep<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> whole<00:01:12.510> thing<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.869> your

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
want to keep the whole thing on your

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
want to keep the whole thing on your
line<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.470> once<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
line at once what we're going to do is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
line at once what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> feed<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> warm<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> hook

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
we're going to feed the warm up the hook

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
we're going to feed the warm up the hook
and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.580> once<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.659> cast<00:01:18.930> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and then once we do that and we cast it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.780 
and then once we do that and we cast it
out<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> couple<00:01:19.860> bites<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.700> they

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
out we get a couple bites and they

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
out we get a couple bites and they
nibble<00:01:21.000> off<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> worm<00:01:22.619> we're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
nibble off the end of the worm we're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
nibble off the end of the worm we're
going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> slide<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> down<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going to go back and slide it down the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
going to go back and slide it down the
hook<00:01:25.920> again<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.790> another<00:01:27.060> piece<00:01:27.270> tease<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
hook again have another piece tease and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
hook again have another piece tease and
not<00:01:28.290> need<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.979> rehook<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> worm<00:01:29.759> every<00:01:30.240> single

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
not need to rehook the worm every single

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510 
not need to rehook the worm every single
time<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.310> take

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
time so what we're going to do is take

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
time so what we're going to do is take
the<00:01:32.670> worm<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.090> we've<00:01:33.180> got<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> head<00:01:33.750> point<00:01:34.110> up

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the worm so we've got the head point up

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.670 
the worm so we've got the head point up
first<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:36.570> we're<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> feed<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
first and then we're going to feed the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
first and then we're going to feed the
hook<00:01:37.890> itself<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.970> through<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> middle<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
hook itself down through the middle of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.710 
hook itself down through the middle of
the<00:01:40.200> worm<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.310> we'll<00:01:41.490> carefully<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the worm so we'll carefully do that and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.620 
the worm so we'll carefully do that and
of<00:01:43.439> course<00:01:43.649> takes<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.130> practice<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
of course takes a little practice to be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
of course takes a little practice to be
good<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.280> sometimes<00:01:47.280> you'll<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.490> able<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
good at this sometimes you'll be able to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.620 
good at this sometimes you'll be able to
do<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.270> away

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
do it right away

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
do it right away
other<00:01:49.259> times<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.829> hands<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.310> nice<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
other times your hands will be nice and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270 
other times your hands will be nice and
slippery<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.170> it'll<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
slippery like now and it'll be a little

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.999 
slippery like now and it'll be a little
bit<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.700> difficult<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
bit more difficult so you can see that

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
bit more difficult so you can see that
we're<00:01:56.159> starting<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.700> sliding<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.509> warm<00:01:57.810> up

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
we're starting by sliding that warm up

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.280 
we're starting by sliding that warm up
the<00:01:58.439> hook<00:01:58.649> itself<00:01:59.450> being<00:02:00.450> long<00:02:00.719> shank<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the hook itself being long shank as I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.649 
the hook itself being long shank as I
said<00:02:01.500> makes<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> easier<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
said makes it easier then what I do is I

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.550 
said makes it easier then what I do is I
turn<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.259> worm<00:02:04.469> over<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.259> head

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
turn the worm over I get it it's head

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
turn the worm over I get it it's head
right<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> top<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> eye<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
right up to the top and the eye of the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.010 
right up to the top and the eye of the
hook<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.700> then<00:02:11.700> once<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.270> there<00:02:12.420> ice

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
hook and then once it's up there ice

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
hook and then once it's up there ice
that<00:02:14.600> over<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.750> hook<00:02:15.900> itself<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.730> begin<00:02:17.730> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
that over the hook itself and begin to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.280 
that over the hook itself and begin to
push<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> worm<00:02:18.740> up<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.190> line<00:02:20.720> now<00:02:21.720> being<00:02:22.110> able

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
push the worm up the line now being able

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.280 
push the worm up the line now being able
to<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.950> getting<00:02:23.430> its<00:02:23.610> head<00:02:24.150> through<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
to do that getting its head through the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.620 
to do that getting its head through the
hook<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.010> getting<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> line<00:02:27.330> is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
hook there and getting it up the line is

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.740 
hook there and getting it up the line is
gonna<00:02:28.290> secure<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.220> hook<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.750> also

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
gonna secure it to the hook and also

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.390 
gonna secure it to the hook and also
make<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.960> much<00:02:31.380> easier<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.070> much<00:02:32.340> more

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
make it much easier and much more

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.600 
make it much easier and much more
natural<00:02:33.240> presentation<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.310> I've

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
natural presentation so now that I've

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.020 
natural presentation so now that I've
done<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.850> I've<00:02:36.450> gotten<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> worm<00:02:37.770> up<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
done that I've gotten the worm up the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.020 
done that I've gotten the worm up the
hook<00:02:39.240> up<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.960> line<00:02:40.170> itself<00:02:40.560> I'll<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.730> leave

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
hook up the line itself I'll just leave

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.390 
hook up the line itself I'll just leave
a<00:02:42.210> small<00:02:42.870> piece<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.260> hook<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.040> end<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
a small piece of hook the end of the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
a small piece of hook the end of the
hook<00:02:44.580> hanging<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.900> end<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> worm

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
hook hanging out the end of the worm

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.650 
hook hanging out the end of the worm
below<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.790> I'll<00:02:47.940> cast<00:02:48.210> sat<00:02:48.480> out

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
below that then I'll cast sat out

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.260 
below that then I'll cast sat out
several<00:02:49.110> times<00:02:49.260> if<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.370> bottom<00:02:50.790> part<00:02:51.000> gets

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
several times if this bottom part gets

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.870 
several times if this bottom part gets
bit<00:02:51.510> off<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.960> I'll<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:53.070> slide<00:02:53.520> more

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
bit off all I'll do is just slide more

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030 
bit off all I'll do is just slide more
of<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.120> down<00:02:54.300> onto<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> hook<00:02:54.980> rehook<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
of it down onto the hook rehook it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
of it down onto the hook rehook it
outside<00:02:56.580> there<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.090> leave<00:02:57.630> another<00:02:57.960> inch<00:02:58.320> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
outside there and leave another inch to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520 
outside there and leave another inch to
inch<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> half<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.520> tail<00:02:59.850> below<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.810> so

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
inch and a half of tail below that so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.120 
inch and a half of tail below that so
that's<00:03:01.740> it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that's it

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.910 
that's it
very<00:03:02.640> very<00:03:02.880> simple<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> hook<00:03:03.810> worms<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.680> best

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
very very simple to hook worms the best

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.800 
very very simple to hook worms the best
way<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.160> do<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.460> is<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:05.790> cut<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> piece<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
way to do it is not cut a piece of the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.200 
way to do it is not cut a piece of the
worm<00:03:07.350> off<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.890> hook<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> sideways<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:09.090> your

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
worm off and hook it sideways on your

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.410 
worm off and hook it sideways on your
hook<00:03:09.390> but<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.440> slide<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.130> up<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.430> hook<00:03:11.610> slide

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
hook but to slide it up the hook slide

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
hook but to slide it up the hook slide
it<00:03:12.570> up<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> line<00:03:12.990> itself<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.770> then<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.400> way

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it up the line itself and then this way

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.610 
it up the line itself and then this way
when<00:03:15.180> you're<00:03:15.300> retrieving<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.050> bait<00:03:16.260> back

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620

when you're retrieving the bait back
across<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.250> bottom<00:03:17.610> it'll<00:03:18.030> give<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.480> much

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
across the bottom it'll give it a much

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140 
across the bottom it'll give it a much
more<00:03:18.810> natural<00:03:19.380> presentation<00:03:20.340> you'll<00:03:20.790> catch<00:03:21.030> a
