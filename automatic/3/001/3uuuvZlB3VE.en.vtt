 I like you 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.110
 to make this recipe we need 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.870
 three egg whites four tablespoons 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.870
 of milk and three sheets of gelatin 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.149
 as always we will start cutting the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 sheets of gelatine in pieces more 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.229
 small and we will hydrate them in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229
 cold water for 3 minutes 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.950
 meanwhile we must warm the milk 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 we can do it quickly in the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.250
 microwave oven 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320
 once the milk is hot 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.180
 we will move to a container and add 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.180
 the gelatin already hydrated 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.990
 we will remove it well so that it dissolves 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.090
 completely 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 now the time has come to create the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 flavor with half a bolero envelope is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.270
 enough we will return to the rest for more 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.270
 late decorate our dessert 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.750
 we must remove it well so that it 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 dissolve completely 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.970
 once we have finished we will mount the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.890

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.360
 moment to pass them to the cups where

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.930

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.090
 sprinkle a little bolero on top 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930
