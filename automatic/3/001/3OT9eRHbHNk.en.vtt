00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
what is the point of putting in these

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.910 
what is the point of putting in these
lobbies<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> mentality

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
lobbies so this is like the mentality

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.080 
lobbies so this is like the mentality
that<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.100> guys<00:02:07.250> are<00:02:07.399> working<00:02:07.520> infinity<00:02:07.940> war
