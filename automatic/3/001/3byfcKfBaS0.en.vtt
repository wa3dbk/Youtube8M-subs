00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.500
 Waseda University Kabe Lab Group 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.509
 Support patients with sleep apnea syndrome 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.499
 I am developing a robot 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.709
 Remodeled plush bear 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.909
 This robot is called "Jyun Kusunkun" 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.280
 As the belly of the bear acts as a pillow 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.020
 In the face and neck of a person sleeping with moving arms 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.020
 It is that touching directly and giving stimulation 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.720
 I can do it 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.520
 First of all the pulse oximeter to be put on this finger 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.170
 This measures blood oxygen level 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 The rest is in this bear 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.500
 Collect “Snoring” with a microphone 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.920
 We put the two together and are in PC 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.809
 Make judgment by software 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.600
 And reflect it to the actuator 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.100
 Depending on the condition of the person 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.129
 I will change how to move the actuator 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.169
 By the movement of the actuator 

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:59.009
 Urge to turn over 

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:05.890
 Or when in awful apnea 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.920
 I will wake up the patient 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.940
 Currently, the number of patients with sleep apnea syndrome is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.020
 It is said that there are approximately 2 million people in Japan alone 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.320
 Daytime sleepiness caused by this 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 Decreased concentration leads to serious accidents 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 Cases have also been reported 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.000
 Sleep apnea syndrome 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.200
 What is used for treatment now 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 It's a bit annoying to say CPAP 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.830
 It is an appliance and if it is possible then 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.900
 If you can support something without such a thing 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.270
 The first way of thinking is that it is good 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.160
 It's just finished 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.080
 For real patients 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.690
 It has not been used yet 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.700
 To not disturb the patient's sleep 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 Communication between patient and robot 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.010
 By electric field communication along the surface of the human body 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.450
 We realize cordless 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.950
 Use such things if possible 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.840
 If you get used to going to the side and sleeping 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 By listening to your own "snoring sound" 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.760
 Change posture without using a machine 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330
 Be able to help one's breathing 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 I'm thinking about a few such programs
