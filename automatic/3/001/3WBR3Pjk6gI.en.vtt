mum that's what will populate the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.199 
mum that's what will populate the
child's<00:02:59.019> digestive<00:02:59.620> tract<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.579> if<00:03:00.700> mum<00:03:00.970> has

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
child's digestive tract so if mum has

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.819 
child's digestive tract so if mum has
got<00:03:01.390> abnormal<00:03:01.900> gut<00:03:02.079> flora<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.530> that's<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:02.799> I

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
got abnormal gut flora and that's what I

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.770 
got abnormal gut flora and that's what I
see<00:03:03.159> in<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.459> mothers<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.909> artistic<00:03:04.180> children

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
see in the mothers of artistic children

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.869 
see in the mothers of artistic children
they<00:03:05.170> all<00:03:05.379> have<00:03:05.620> got<00:03:05.799> conditions<00:03:06.280> related<00:03:06.760> to

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
they all have got conditions related to

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.210 
they all have got conditions related to
abnormalities<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> gut<00:03:08.049> flora<00:03:08.230> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
abnormalities and the gut flora then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.550 
abnormalities and the gut flora then
that's<00:03:09.430> what<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.700> baby<00:03:09.879> gets<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:11.260> baby<00:03:11.440> is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that's what the baby gets the baby is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.470 
that's what the baby gets the baby is
also<00:03:11.650> born<00:03:12.040> with<00:03:12.190> an<00:03:12.280> immature<00:03:12.519> immune<00:03:12.940> system

also born with an immature immune system

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.210 
also born with an immature immune system
this<00:03:13.690> establishment<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.440> normal<00:03:14.859> gut<00:03:15.040> flora

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
this establishment of normal gut flora

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.670 
this establishment of normal gut flora
in<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.640> first<00:03:15.879> 20<00:03:16.239> or<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:16.510> days<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.900> life<00:03:17.079> plays

in the first 20 or so days of life plays

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.099 
in the first 20 or so days of life plays
a<00:03:17.709> crucial<00:03:18.099> role<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.640> appropriate<00:03:19.269> maturation

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
a crucial role in appropriate maturation

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.159 
a crucial role in appropriate maturation
of<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.709> immune<00:03:20.919> system<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.269> because<00:03:22.959> these

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
of the immune system so because these

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.830 
of the immune system so because these
babies<00:03:23.380> don't<00:03:23.739> get<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.190> normal<00:03:24.459> gut<00:03:24.609> flora

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
babies don't get the normal gut flora

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.690 
babies don't get the normal gut flora
