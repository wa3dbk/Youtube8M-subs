00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.480
 so lifted this quasi the first independent tutorial 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.520
 what you should be about alternatives 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.520
 «What we needed and on a PSP 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.359
 rather with a normal original Sony rather a box aufzuspielen 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.960
 that is not easy it is not easy so that they are not in Lienz 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.730
 Stehlgut installed in a small detour I want you to go here 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.150
 Matthias Maute 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 bring closer Graßl needed here 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.099
 Memory stick 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.640
 with Joel Matip gg we are over 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.620
 and meadow must work too 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.180
 to come later 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 then we need an old normal r-kom 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 we have to turn that into Pandora 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 missing 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.800
 the PSG 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.840
 virtually without turning on Jannis moe-states and we can say directly 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 that they should do something from the stick 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.770
 As I said before, Canori has to be seen 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.690
 He could not do this himself 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.510
 Gallen 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.829
 You do not have PSP with Treasurer available, you have to do that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 of course a PSP 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.170
 who already has the cashier and movies on it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 use and make this battery to Pandora 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.650
 this program that does that can not run the normal movies 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.990
 there will be the problem 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 second problem is also known only to put this magic stick 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.340
 this through 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.180
 can also be created under Windows XP, we also have PS of course 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.450
 Look at the EU high some tutorials 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.830
 the normal case is of course that we have this stick 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.770
 many a Custom EasyTone PSP create you see the hook is already 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.590
 he always needs somebody who already has such a thing in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 Ancaster version has 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.310
 Possibilities are of course you let it do it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.250
 you can charge your battery and hi Memory Stick 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.980
 give it to someone so he will make you a magic stick and a panther 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.030
 Orko makes up 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.450
 or the gives off your PSP 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 so that you almost quit the PSP directly 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910
 both daily per cent 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.550
 more options 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.260
 and Wintry Church Smiley - do as it should 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.420
 prepared 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.610
 captivating but still simple 2 8 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.900
 Soost 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 that's normal 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.119
 it's called stalking 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.069
 the duo 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.069
 ready to start and instead new elections to shift knob 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.219
 And in the end, of course, it's off and if we available here 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.669
 I want to race 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:35.159
 there have this 2 n Pandora installer of three accomplices x in version 3 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.479
 from Hellgate 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.179
 this program is there to prepare the magic stick around the 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.179
 Prioritizing battery the city is what that is 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.340
 Here I can first prepare for bed that you are in this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.049
 Tutorial video and not 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.219
 The clearly stated on PSP stresses how it is done 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.359
 Anyhow, this program needs to be seen and seen 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.709
 That's because we're with it 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.519
 Bodo Kohlmeyer the function larger tour with the Kripo neu-ulm 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.149
 Porsche were traveled to Berthold 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.149
 that means I can get off with 3 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.049
 and that always hurts me next 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 after five seconds 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.139
 Rome swallows honorary artist from bitter tears and words 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.579
 out 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.979
 so and now take a discharge 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.559
 only it's usually hers 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.559
 have the reasons and see where the device 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.649
 FAS ass 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:45.739
 you could say 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.069
 and humming so far actually nonsense in the morning is so synonymous one 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.239
 counter 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.389
 that's just the function for it if you still have the Magic Stick 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.680
 want to use otherwise 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.260
 and not that it immediately adds momentum to the menu 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.749
 Kassen films plays 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.089
 that we then in any case too high 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:05.349
 what pulling in the shoulder to hold the ban 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.299
 and nobody has 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.189
 so what Matters also new elections 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.189
 starts again left shoulder that was worth it 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.529
 and documents in front of the wall also anonymous 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:22.439
 this Pandora menu in the most normal form I higher a vision 1 5 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.710
 play 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.699
 This version is for the original version with the KEC exploit 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.800
 check out the possibility offers from there every possible 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.840
 To install route guides 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.210
 Of course that is not possible for him because the first three 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.870
 Sets were shipped out and blocked 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.210
 without in which tricks no 1 5 0 impact 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.310
 therefore,% one invented this tool that is the day of c-mind karaoke what 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.750
 responsible for it 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.380
 direct this process one rather upplay, for example in this case 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.710
 the three Potash One in 33 in Revision 5 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.930
 thus can be made with this tool and that Lehmann to a 3 8 0 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.139
 Make m30 revision five 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.870
 Do this for you now by standing here extreme winters too he could 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.810
 to the number 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.300
 3power decline of his point of view 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.669
 some circles I could also use the originals 3 8 and redone that 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.919
 Actually, we do not want to like my function 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.759
 who will need it 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.840
 and which one would press Cham 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.910
 a very prosaic barrage of information in another 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.659
 Tutorial with it finds young percent 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.069
 where I get but then a bit with the upper range 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.870
 I do not do that now because this already box West should still 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.460
 once they explain the menu and it will look like this with you 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.499
 so bring Appel away from the intoxicant drug store 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.429
 at PSP already famous and beautiful that such a show really 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.020
 the municipal construction yard to another 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.830
 Nominate Ronny Ernst 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.199
 and now of course I want my iPhone again St 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.250
 normalize 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.939
 that means I have to go here 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.460
 the minuet 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.369
 on the Mauna Loa is Red 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.430
 Conclusion who recognizes roads again the same partner 1 $ Mimi of 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.539
 and then lost a point 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.669
 Dr therefore means 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.039
 the bulk of the TUI TUI has been taken 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.039
 Sprayer the motorcycle in Ahrensburg TUI normal than 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.699
 make sure that the triangular take off 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.809
 more out 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.689
 and we are almost back 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.849
 perfectly normal 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.960
 in our XMB 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.789
 that this works with shoulder button I come to the menu Porsche under the 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.520
 the city like the PSP normal 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.750
 I remember that these have whipped with a paella and market 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.030
 almost like a Bluetooth 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.680
 for your PC 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.090
 the special version is also in a second point to do if PSP King because 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.559
 Austen explained and made you clear 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.909
 This version is important, as I said earlier, "Here I am mine 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.789
 would like to use the biggest winner 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.519
 When inserting the battery, an area is requested here on the Memory Stick 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.350
 If I know now I do not do anything, he started our car from the Memory Stick 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.590
 First of all, he has to go well and pretend he's the one 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.020
 flip the switch 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.690
 90 but then the shoulder that he hold the pressed he comes into this menu 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.720
 that just seen on the black background 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.139
 is not a street now 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.720
 and a Berlin SPD does not talk about this internal use facts 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.550
 Cynthia with it 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.599
 start the EPSG normally 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:25.789
 wins do not want you to be able to start them normally anymore 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:27.130
 I do not accumulate everything anymore 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.369
 just turn it off without a battery adapter and you can start the PSP again 

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:35.050
 Euro and around ten ships allow facilities to sample my PSP 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.120
 Cypriot big we looked horny for Miro Front I hope and 9
