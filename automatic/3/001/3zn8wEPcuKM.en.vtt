00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello friends, in this video review I want to show the model 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.220
 BMW 750 Li (F01) 1/43 scale 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 in tuning performance LUMMA DESIGN CLR 750 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.410
 the manufacturer of this model is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.870
 RENN Miniatures 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.860
 when I saw the model data a couple of months ago 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.779
 it seemed to me that this is a new division 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.070
 company spark or maybe this is new 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.989
 Kyosho division 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.769
 It turned out that this is a Russian company 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.929
 which presented 3 very interesting models in tuning performance 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.879
 This is the BMW 5 Series (E60) Lumma 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.199
 BMW 8 Series (E31) Koenig-Specials 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:40.909
 and BMW model of the seventh series 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.280
 which you see in this video 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.100
 each model is made 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.240
 very limited edition 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.200
 thousands of units and price for each of the models 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.530
 makes 2200 rubles 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.540
 Of course, this is a fairly high price, but when you consider that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.890
 model is made of resin 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.870
 and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.320
 as models 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.280
 made from resin are high end models 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.130
 today the price of such models 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.630
 can reach five and six thousand rubles 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.170
 I think that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 direct competitors of these models 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 are models Spark and NEO 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 but the model from RENN Miniatures 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.820
 there is an undoubted advantage 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.799
 this is a lower price 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.409
 compared to competitors 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.720
 and higher model detailing 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 the model very precisely falls within 1/43 scale 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 she has the correct body geometry 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.610
 due to the fact that the model is made of resin 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.979
 it seems that 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.159
 each body part is made separately 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.360
 despite 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.210
 that the model has a solid cast body 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.180
 and no opening items 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.240
 the model is very light 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.150
 the model has a very high-quality body painting 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.050
 all individual parts are very well installed 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.000
 no smudges of paint or glue 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 I really liked how the salon was designed 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.240
 and the fact that the manufacturer 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.659
 paid special attention to various trifles 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.899
 very well designed seats, steering wheel 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.069
 highly detailed instruments and control buttons 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.769
 imitation of seat belts also available 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.749
 can be seen on the seat belt imitation latch 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.530
 very well made ceiling 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.269
 there is an imitation of pens 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.700
 sun visors 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.349
 In principle, such an imitation you will not meet 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.459
 even on very expensive models 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.869
 on the backs of the seats 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.109
 there is an imitation of monitors 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.279
 all this is done very neatly 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.069
 and looks very good on this model 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.269
 very well made rims 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.559
 the disc is painted in matt black 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.909
 disc rim is made of chrome 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.400
 there is an imitation of brake caliper 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.639
 and brake discs 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.919
 nameplates and logos 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:09.539
 very neatly installed 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.309
 everything is very beautifully done 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.649
 I liked how the manufacturer reproduced 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.129
 taillights 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.309
 who saw a real prototype, he knows that 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.539
 Optics for these models are made of LEDs 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.949
 as you can see on the model too 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.069
 imitation of the LEDs themselves 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.419
 only wish 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.459
 I would like to see 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.789
 on models of this level 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.209
 more detailed bottom 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.539
 also models from Spark and 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.629
 NEO models 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.659
 have a less developed bottom than cheaper models of the company AUTOart 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.249
 this is due to 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.460
 that most collectors 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.229
 will not remove this model 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.639
 from box display but still 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.949
 I would like to see 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.389
 more detailed bottom 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.499
 overall a very good model and very pleased that 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.109
 our compatriots 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.169
 produce models of this level 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.369
 until that time in Russia 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.109
 models of such a high level did not 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.959
 Of course there are small firms that produce models 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 trucks and buses but the quality 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.859
 their performance leaves much to be desired 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.490
 and when the next model comes out 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.060
 then it has many drawbacks 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.220
 here you see the finished product which 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.449
 able to compete 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.969
 with high end class models 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.180
 for example, with companies like Schuco from the Pro.R series 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.680
 Spark, NEO 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.720
 and maybe even RedLine and Looksmart 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.760
 if you collect models of the brand BMW 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.100
 or models in tuning performance 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.130
 be sure to pay these models 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.389
 they are limited edition 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.460
 and in the future such models you no longer buy 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.030
 You can purchase these models 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.710
 directly from the manufacturer 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.890
 they have their own website 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.060
 www.renn-miniatures.com 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 there is also a VKontakte group 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.660
 there you can ask various 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.140
 questions you are interested in 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.800
 links to sites and groups 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.709
 I will add in the description to this video 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.289
 very good models 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.729
 I am very pleased with the purchase in the future 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.499
 I will try to buy 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.029
 other models from this 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.240
 manufacturer and 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.419
 more new items are expected at the end of the summer 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.479
 I have already seen one of the new models 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.509
 This is a Mercedes W140, I will definitely buy it too 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.310
 and do a video review 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:06:00.220
 thank you borrowing it was a model review 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.919
 BMW 750 Li (LUMMA CLR 750) 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.940
 see you in the next video
