out of everybody as well so I don't know
personally<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.890> think<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:54.620> mean<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:56.460> hope

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
personally I think I mean I would hope

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
personally I think I mean I would hope
Broly<00:00:57.120> would<00:00:57.329> win<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> feeling<00:00:58.680> cell

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
Broly would win but I'm a feeling cell

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
Broly would win but I'm a feeling cell
might<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.789> he<00:00:59.910> could<00:01:00.059> regenerate

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
might just because he could regenerate

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.189 
might just because he could regenerate
and<00:01:01.020> he<00:01:01.739> has<00:01:01.949> everybody's<00:01:02.670> moveset<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.870> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and he has everybody's moveset so I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
and he has everybody's moveset so I
don't<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.460> again<00:01:05.580> broly<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
don't know but then again broly you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.830 
don't know but then again broly you
can't<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.570> very

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
can't really I don't know it's very very

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
can't really I don't know it's very very
difficult<00:01:09.900> mean<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> guys<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
difficult mean what do you guys think I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.679 
difficult mean what do you guys think I
mean<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.210> win<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.630> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
mean do you think is really win do you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.010 
mean do you think is really win do you
think<00:01:12.869> cell<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.200> kill<00:01:13.439> him<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:14.340> know

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
think cell would kill him I don't know

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.300 
think cell would kill him I don't know
just<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.259> hard<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> tell<00:01:17.070> me<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just very very hard to tell me and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
just very very hard to tell me and
broadly<00:01:17.580> got<00:01:17.729> those<00:01:17.909> super<00:01:18.270> powerful<00:01:18.540> attacks

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
broadly got those super powerful attacks

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.160 
broadly got those super powerful attacks
and<00:01:19.310> cell<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.340> mean<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.880> terms<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> speed<00:01:21.869> i

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and cell i mean in terms of speed i

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
and cell i mean in terms of speed i
think<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.850> cell<00:01:24.180> would<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.450> much

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
think so you know cell would be much

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
think so you know cell would be much
faster<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.229> terms<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.460> brute

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
faster in terms of you know brute

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
faster in terms of you know brute
strength<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.659> Goldie<00:01:28.020> got<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
strength i think Goldie got that in the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
strength i think Goldie got that in the
bag<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.100> uh<00:01:29.970> she<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> move

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
bag but uh she like it's like this move

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
bag but uh she like it's like this move
like<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.770> nearly<00:01:32.100> killed<00:01:32.460> Gohan<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> Super

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
like this nearly killed Gohan a Super

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
like this nearly killed Gohan a Super
Saiyan<00:01:33.270> 2<00:01:33.659> level<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.200> don't<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> would

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
Saiyan 2 level I don't know it would

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.789 
Saiyan 2 level I don't know it would
probably<00:01:35.700> injure<00:01:36.450> Broly<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.140> rolling<00:01:37.680> would

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
probably injure Broly but rolling would

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.490 
probably injure Broly but rolling would
probably<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.270> just
