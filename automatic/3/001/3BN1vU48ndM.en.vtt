00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
mechanics uh they're pretty easy to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.190 
mechanics uh they're pretty easy to
dodge<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.009> he<00:02:08.130> throws<00:02:08.340> random

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
dodge this one way he throws random

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.199

would<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.289> call<00:02:10.500> icicles<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> ground<00:02:11.520> so

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
would he call icicles to the ground so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.750 
would he call icicles to the ground so
you<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.360> got<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.630> stay<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> red

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you just got to stay out of the red

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090 
you just got to stay out of the red
circles<00:02:14.760> which<00:02:15.080> somehow<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.260> did<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.800> do

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
circles which somehow I did not do

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.380 
circles which somehow I did not do
through<00:02:17.340> well<00:02:18.140> his<00:02:19.140> second<00:02:19.830> ability<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
through well his second ability it's a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.840 
through well his second ability it's a
frost<00:02:21.720> breath<00:02:22.019> which<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.800> fun<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.280> cone<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
frost breath which is a fun so cone is a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.030 
frost breath which is a fun so cone is a
short<00:02:24.120> range<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:25.410> much<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.709> one

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
short range but it's pretty much a one

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.130 
short range but it's pretty much a one
shot<00:02:26.280> why<00:02:26.550> don't<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.730> get<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.540> touch<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
shot why don't you get if you touch the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.710 
shot why don't you get if you touch the
ice<00:02:28.350> breath<00:02:28.769> you're<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.519> down<00:02:29.720> that's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
ice breath you're going down that's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
ice breath you're going down that's
putting<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.140> child<00:02:31.410> goes<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.310> how<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
putting my child goes so how have a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.630 
putting my child goes so how have a
perfect<00:02:33.600> example<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.140> coming<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.709> then

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
perfect example of that coming up then

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
perfect example of that coming up then
he<00:02:35.760> also<00:02:35.910> has<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> second<00:02:36.690> form<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.170> otherwise

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
he also has a second form but otherwise

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.360 
he also has a second form but otherwise
he<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.280> doesn't<00:02:38.489> know<00:02:38.730> mainly<00:02:39.180> facts<00:02:40.370> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
he just doesn't know mainly facts so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.770 
he just doesn't know mainly facts so
we're<00:02:41.790> gonna<00:02:41.910> show<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.269> think<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
we're gonna show you I think this is a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990 
we're gonna show you I think this is a
frost<00:02:43.170> breath<00:02:43.350> coming<00:02:43.650> up<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:44.850> gonna

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
frost breath coming up so I'm gonna

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300 
frost breath coming up so I'm gonna
start<00:02:45.239> running<00:02:45.600> towards<00:02:45.810> him<00:02:46.049> yo<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:46.950> she<00:02:47.010> also

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
start running towards him yo so she also

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800 
start running towards him yo so she also
does<00:02:47.549> not<00:02:47.730> back<00:02:47.970> people<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.600> there

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
does not back people so right there

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
does not back people so right there
there<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.950> false<00:02:50.250> pair<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.700> breath

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
there you go one false pair of breath

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.240 
there you go one false pair of breath

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
second formula pond with this he got

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.460 
second formula pond with this he got
bugged<00:03:31.950> he<00:03:32.640> focuses<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:33.329> target<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.900> he's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
bugged he focuses one target and he's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.530 
bugged he focuses one target and he's
supposed<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.859> charge<00:03:35.100> after<00:03:35.400> them<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.450> were

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
supposed to charge after them you were

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.000 
supposed to charge after them you were
supposed<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> run<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.799> course<00:03:37.950> that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
supposed to run but of course that

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.940 
supposed to run but of course that
didn't<00:03:38.340> really<00:03:38.579> seem<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.820> work<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.380> i<00:03:40.680> decided

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
didn't really seem to work so i decided

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.479 
didn't really seem to work so i decided
to<00:03:41.370> run<00:03:41.549> around<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.910> circles<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:43.459> yeah<00:03:44.459> i

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
to run around in circles and then yeah i

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.770 
to run around in circles and then yeah i
probably<00:03:44.609> could<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.090> kept<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.510> running

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
probably could have kept just running

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.180 
probably could have kept just running
around<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.049> circles<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.739> course<00:03:46.920> i<00:03:47.010> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
around in circles but of course i just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.789 
around in circles but of course i just
wanted<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.900> challenge<00:03:48.900> even<00:03:49.709> though

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
wanted to have a challenge even though

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.680 
wanted to have a challenge even though
it's<00:03:49.890> very<00:03:50.069> challenging<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.819> i<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.569> decided

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
it's very challenging so i just decided

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.940 
it's very challenging so i just decided
to<00:03:52.019> run<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.530> start

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
to run up and start

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.410 
to run up and start
acronym<00:03:53.250> which<00:03:53.280> ended<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:53.849> being<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.180> stupid

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
acronym which ended up being a stupid

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.510 
acronym which ended up being a stupid
idea<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> quote<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.280> course

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
idea but a quote for the course

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.309 
idea but a quote for the course
otherwise<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:57.330> were<00:03:57.450> pretty<00:03:57.750> much<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.080> SAT

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
otherwise we were pretty much the SAT

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.830 
otherwise we were pretty much the SAT
