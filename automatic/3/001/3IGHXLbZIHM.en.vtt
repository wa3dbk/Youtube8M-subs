cool idea like even if I would you know

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.050 
cool idea like even if I would you know
by<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:57.200> thirty<00:04:58.200> dollar<00:04:58.380> item<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.070> sixty<00:04:59.880> people

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
by a thirty dollar item and sixty people

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.600 
by a thirty dollar item and sixty people
entered<00:05:02.450> they'd<00:05:03.450> only<00:05:03.600> have<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.080> know

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
give me fifty cents I mean fifty cents

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.310 

so<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:13.000> think<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.390> made<00:05:13.540> kind<00:05:13.750> of<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.930> cool<00:05:14.080> idea

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320
