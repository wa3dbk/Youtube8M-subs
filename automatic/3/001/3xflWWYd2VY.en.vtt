00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.080 
her that she had to look a certain way
so<00:03:35.900> she<00:03:36.230> grew<00:03:36.590> up<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.340> now<00:03:37.730> she<00:03:37.790> is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
so she grew up like that and now she is

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.759 
so she grew up like that and now she is
doing<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.630> same<00:03:38.840> thing<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.290> her<00:03:39.440> daughter

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
doing the same thing to her daughter

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.220 
doing the same thing to her daughter
that's<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> reason<00:03:40.700> why<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:41.540> really<00:03:41.959> need<00:03:42.140> to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
that's the reason why you really need to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.110 
that's the reason why you really need to
start<00:03:42.560> loving<00:03:42.980> yourself<00:03:43.070> at<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.459> younger<00:03:43.790> age

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
start loving yourself at a younger age

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.850 
start loving yourself at a younger age
rather<00:03:44.450> than<00:03:44.690> waiting<00:03:44.930> till<00:03:45.110> you're<00:03:45.380> older

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
rather than waiting till you're older

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.000 
rather than waiting till you're older
you<00:03:46.190> don't<00:03:46.370> want<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.610> end<00:03:46.730> up<00:03:46.880> like<00:03:47.630> maybe<00:03:48.410> your

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
you don't want to end up like maybe your

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.520 
you don't want to end up like maybe your
mother<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.730> she's<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.269> an<00:03:50.420> eternal<00:03:50.989> diet<00:03:51.230> and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
mother if she's on an eternal diet and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.949 
mother if she's on an eternal diet and
she<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:52.160> never<00:03:52.400> seems<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.390> be<00:03:53.480> happy<00:03:53.840> with

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
she just never seems to be happy with

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.300 
she just never seems to be happy with
the<00:03:54.080> way<00:03:54.200> she<00:03:54.410> looks<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.799> don't<00:03:54.950> want<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.160> end

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
the way she looks you don't want to end

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.990 
the way she looks you don't want to end
up<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.610> that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
up like that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.750 
up like that
so<00:03:56.390> why<00:03:56.840> follow<00:03:57.200> suit<00:03:57.530> why<00:03:57.890> not<00:03:58.040> break<00:03:58.549> the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so why follow suit why not break the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.330 
so why follow suit why not break the
chain<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.360> just<00:03:59.390> change<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.320> now<00:04:00.650> before<00:04:01.010> it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
chain and just change it now before it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.300 
chain and just change it now before it's
