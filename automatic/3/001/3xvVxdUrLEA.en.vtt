mixture<00:04:47.800> Google<00:04:48.800> then<00:04:49.010> blend<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.120> all

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
mixture Google then blend it all

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.040 
mixture Google then blend it all
together<00:04:50.830> ok<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:51.890> just<00:04:52.040> let<00:04:52.850> this<00:04:53.360> go<00:04:54.020> for

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
together ok so just let this go for

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.350 
together ok so just let this go for
another<00:04:54.350> 30<00:04:54.680> minutes<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.430> let<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.880> settle

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.090 

this<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.480> what<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.750> gravy<00:04:59.990> looks<00:05:00.290> like<00:05:00.560> or<00:05:00.860> the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
this is what the gravy looks like or the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.490 
this is what the gravy looks like or the
beginnings<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.760> should<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:02.000> say<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.450> once<00:05:03.320> it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
beginnings of it should I say I once it

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.560 
beginnings of it should I say I once it
has<00:05:03.620> been<00:05:04.580> taken<00:05:04.910> off<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.090> heat<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.450> it's

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
has been taken off the heat and it's

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.470 
has been taken off the heat and it's
cooled<00:05:05.840> for<00:05:06.050> 30<00:05:06.260> minutes<00:05:06.680> or<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.000> I'm<00:05:08.000> going<00:05:08.330> to

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
cooled for 30 minutes or so I'm going to

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.110 
cooled for 30 minutes or so I'm going to
now<00:05:08.630> blend<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.460> we'll<00:05:10.610> come<00:05:10.790> back<00:05:10.820> when

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
now blend it and we'll come back when

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.480 
now blend it and we'll come back when
it's<00:05:11.330> in<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.570> blended<00:05:12.050> State

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.680 

this<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.640> what<00:05:15.790> it<00:05:15.880> looks<00:05:16.060> like<00:05:16.270> once<00:05:16.480> it's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
this is what it looks like once it's

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.870 
this is what it looks like once it's
been<00:05:16.840> blended<00:05:17.380> now<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.400> can<00:05:18.520> see<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:18.820> looks

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
been blended now you can see it looks

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.360 
been blended now you can see it looks
very<00:05:19.180> much<00:05:19.360> like<00:05:19.390> Vic<00:05:19.960> soup<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.070> put<00:05:21.280> it

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
very much like Vic soup and I put it

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.340 
very much like Vic soup and I put it
back<00:05:21.490> on<00:05:21.550> low<00:05:21.970> heat<00:05:22.300> again<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:22.960> what<00:05:23.260> I'm

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
back on low heat again and what I'm

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.050 
back on low heat again and what I'm
trying<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.920> achieve<00:05:24.010> here<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.640> can<00:05:24.820> see<00:05:25.000> just

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
trying to achieve here you can see just

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.680 
trying to achieve here you can see just
around<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.570> edges<00:05:26.320> here<00:05:26.350> is<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.650> bit<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.980> oil

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
around the edges here is a bit of oil

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.480 
around the edges here is a bit of oil
what's<00:05:28.690> going<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:28.960> happen<00:05:29.290> is<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:30.430> will

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
what's going to happen is this will

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.690 
what's going to happen is this will
start<00:05:30.970> bubbling<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.750> they<00:05:32.530> start<00:05:32.890> frothing<00:05:33.460> a

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
start bubbling and they start frothing a

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.540 
start bubbling and they start frothing a
label<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.120> main<00:05:34.320> thing<00:05:35.320> here<00:05:35.710> is<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.980> notice

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
label the main thing here is to notice

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.670 
label the main thing here is to notice
that<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:37.180> oil<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.660> beginning<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.080> separate

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
that the oil is beginning to separate

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.910 
that the oil is beginning to separate
once<00:05:39.550> that<00:05:39.790> happens<00:05:40.240> your<00:05:40.900> gravy<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.440> almost

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
once that happens your gravy is almost

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.540 
once that happens your gravy is almost
ready

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
ready

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.460 
ready
the<00:05:43.060> other<00:05:43.210> thing<00:05:43.390> that<00:05:43.420> you<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.840> do<00:05:44.110> you

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
the other thing that you can do you

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.630 
the other thing that you can do you
don't<00:05:44.590> have<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.800> do<00:05:44.980> it<00:05:45.040> at<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.220> stage<00:05:45.370> you

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
don't have to do it at this stage you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.980 
don't have to do it at this stage you
can<00:05:45.670> do<00:05:45.850> it<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:46.000> bit<00:05:46.150> later<00:05:46.360> is<00:05:46.570> add<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.720> bit<00:05:46.960> more

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
can do it a bit later is add a bit more

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.350 
can do it a bit later is add a bit more
water<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:48.190> thin<00:05:48.430> it<00:05:48.460> down<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.060> should<00:05:49.240> have

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
water to thin it down so you should have

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.900 
water to thin it down so you should have
the<00:05:49.510> consistency<00:05:50.140> of<00:05:50.320> milk<00:05:50.650> at<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.520> moment

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
the consistency of milk at the moment

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.490 
the consistency of milk at the moment
this<00:05:52.000> is<00:05:52.150> very<00:05:52.330> much<00:05:52.480> like<00:05:52.540> soup<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.320> just<00:05:53.440> to

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
this is very much like soup and just to

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.950 
this is very much like soup and just to
give<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.680> an<00:05:53.830> idea<00:05:54.450> this<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.510> what<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.840> looks

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
give you an idea this is what it looks

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.740 
give you an idea this is what it looks
like<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.170> thick<00:05:56.410> soup<00:05:57.180> so<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.270> can<00:05:58.420> add<00:05:58.510> a<00:05:58.540> little

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
like a thick soup so we can add a little

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.450 
like a thick soup so we can add a little
bit<00:05:58.930> more<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.290> watering<00:05:59.680> but<00:05:59.920> first<00:06:00.220> of<00:06:00.370> all

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
bit more of watering but first of all

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.520 
bit more of watering but first of all
just<00:06:00.670> let<00:06:00.790> it<00:06:00.940> warm<00:06:01.600> through<00:06:01.930> again<00:06:02.230> in<00:06:02.380> this

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
just let it warm through again in this

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.430 
just let it warm through again in this
SEM<00:06:03.180> this<00:06:04.180> state<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:04.810> then<00:06:04.930> we<00:06:05.020> can<00:06:05.170> add<00:06:05.290> the

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
SEM this state and then we can add the

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.310 
SEM this state and then we can add the
water<00:06:05.620> at<00:06:05.890> a<00:06:05.980> later<00:06:06.190> stage<00:06:06.990> once<00:06:07.990> you've<00:06:08.170> done

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
water at a later stage once you've done

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.280 
water at a later stage once you've done
that<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:09.250> gravy<00:06:09.520> is<00:06:09.760> then<00:06:09.940> complete<00:06:10.390> what<00:06:11.170> I'd

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
that the gravy is then complete what I'd

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.080 
that the gravy is then complete what I'd
advise<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.650> to<00:06:11.860> do<00:06:12.070> then<00:06:12.280> is<00:06:12.520> just<00:06:12.760> store<00:06:13.060> it

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
advise you to do then is just store it
