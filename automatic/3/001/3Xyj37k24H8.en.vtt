00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.930
 Wusch interviewed you Phillip Morris here 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.269
 I warmly welcome the new one 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.400
 The consequence is, I decide 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.210
 Shopping you can see in the video 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.720
 supermarket and has struck 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:29.900
 whole eleven cans of one unknown to her 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:32.480
 manufacturer of lemonade sweetened with the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.610
 good stevia i'm a big fan of 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.379
 light products and will be easy 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.840
 like to know the comparison how to taste 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.820
 the things more important than tolerated 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 the things also if you in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.899
 Therefore, larger groups are drinking here today 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.220
 We will not be charity cocktails 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.860
 only the taste test but we 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.309
 still all 11,000 destroy remains 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.170
 every turn is off is cool 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.370
 should have thought what arrived today 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.940
 not at the top you already know 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.540
 but on the 16th 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.540
 extremely nice view 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 although he is not that high, of course 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 like at the top but also the week extreme 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.730
 brutally hot 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.420
 you might see ours otherwise 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.420
 test objects 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.470
 to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's about what 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.560
 in the end analysis what many well-known 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.450
 and successful companies too 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.210
 has done a bit the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.819
 components also extremely funny 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.479
 I have not found a life sign and 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.869
 at that time the book has already read 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.569
 David j 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 that was close to australia at that time 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.869
 from 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.100
 very funny in any case, good 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.289
 timed and we will go now 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.129
 So start love here 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.129
 to cover this 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 I'll look through it one by one 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 then test my taste rating 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.270
 give 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.580
 a lot of fun compactrio 96 I think so 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.450
 in eating better, the day I think 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.700
 do not be so beside her see the whole 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.530
 a great fun in the weather 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.210
 Also the whole thing like you video I think 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.370
 a total of almost 50 minutes long 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.920
 I have it here in a timelapse on me 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.990
 do not like 3000 percent or 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.100
 like this 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.060
 because otherwise it would be eternal 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 I would have the whole 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.400
 tastes still graded individually 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.140
 exactly in the sense of the year were great fun 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.090
 Above all, it was just there 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.430
 quiet a big oftring missing and me 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.510
 Just wanted to know 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.760
 First, as the taste of this 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.820
 topic things and secondly how is the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.830
 Compatibility and I think I have 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.720
 no problem for example now ten 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.610
 cans of the same drink that drinks 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.170
 is also quite fast but now in 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.209
 even 11 2 11 different 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.790
 and partly with possible wild ones 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.830
 she was on everybody 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.450
 case very very funny compatibility 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.950
 I will say in detail later 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 compatibility I have to say it very much 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.570
 very good that i did not have any at all 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.530
 top problems and in some located 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.570
 I want products there sooner 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 but I have to be sensitive and taste 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.260
 Unfortunately, saying was really pretty bad 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.470
 in itself you have everything of orange 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.450
 About cola about cherry cola about that 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.150
 broad things so something with 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.030
 lemon and it has always been 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.670
 tasted rather watery 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.810
 unfortunately not really sweet the festival 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.890
 funny because this is pretty 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.810
 but that's why he is strong 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.110
 unfortunately I have a disappointment 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.110
 to say honestly 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:14.610
 You have bad luck now 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.610
 with the results because bad 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.650
 Yes 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.650
 sometimes as a summary 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.610
 locked in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.310
 lemon lime I have the new one 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.310
 given industry night 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.650
 per se 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.080
 I do not know 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.130
 maybe it takes a little time 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.130
 or I stay spoiled but 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.360
 Most people can really enjoy it 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.360
 Flavors are not in it 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.590
 The Orange has as already mentioned and the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.030
 Lemon lime 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.150
 So if you stand on stevia then go 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.930
 the two best chance 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.860
 otherwise I have many 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.860
 flavor here 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:20.080
 I hope everything fits with me now 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.650
 not even curious about the topic belly 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.860
 1 m 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.860
 Yes 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.839
 otherwise I would say decide 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.049
 just with a wonderful view 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:34.019
 the city 

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:37.429
 what positive can bring out already 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.429
 almost sinking 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.960
 he runs I do 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:58.640
 47 in total 42 45 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:02.280
 the first 7000 approximately about 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.870
 22 minutes almost the same time for the 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.760
 last four normal 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.330
 that was really hard especially this one 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.740
 wore are added hard 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.200
 if it likes to drink from you then 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.950
 Write that my party just 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.620
 otherwise I would be crazy 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.550
 Here from the beautiful Vancouver we 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.140
 Definitely see each other at the next 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:30.840
 I'm out all injured two 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:34.199
 hours later I am here on the grill resp 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.260
 Eggplant tomato paprika and something 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:40.260
 send and we are open up here 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.770
 his calls if he is my absolute 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.770
 mistake 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.130
 Yes again very short summary 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:55.060
 beautiful namely about two 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:58.510
 hours after the night service stevia 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.660
 soft drinks reasonably good like about 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.270
 four meters lighter it goes straight into the 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.460
 training them again very briefly 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.140
 Feedback compatibility in any case 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.780
 good taste now mitgekriegt 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.220
