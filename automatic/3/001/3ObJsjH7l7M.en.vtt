00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
natural if you this is the mini but

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.559 
natural if you this is the mini but
otherwise<00:03:38.040> those<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.489> mine<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.510> I

otherwise those the mine that and I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.960 
otherwise those the mine that and I
guess<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:41.129> of<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.489> couldn't<00:03:41.760> say<00:03:41.849> as

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
guess it's kind of you couldn't say as

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.619

mini<00:03:42.180> Matt<00:03:42.389> like<00:03:43.049> mine<00:03:43.379> mi<00:03:43.949> ne<00:03:44.250> milli<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.569> you

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
mini Matt like mine mi ne milli so you

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.030 
mini Matt like mine mi ne milli so you
have<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> collection<00:03:46.440> point<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.889> all

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
have like a collection point this is all

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.879 
have like a collection point this is all
just<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.549> show<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.150> stuff<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:49.739> are

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
just for like show and stuff this we are

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.379 
just for like show and stuff this we are
think<00:03:50.129> I<00:03:50.250> am<00:03:50.370> thinking<00:03:50.699> of<00:03:50.760> setting<00:03:50.970> up<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.150> pain

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
think I am thinking of setting up a pain

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.189 
think I am thinking of setting up a pain
a<00:03:51.629> payment<00:03:51.949> thing<00:03:52.949> like<00:03:53.310> am<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.940> currency<00:03:54.569> but

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
a payment thing like am a currency but

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.509 
a payment thing like am a currency but
who<00:03:55.410> knows<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:57.349> what's<00:03:58.349> he<00:03:58.410> got<00:03:58.560> here<00:03:58.680> it's

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
who knows and what's he got here it's

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
who knows and what's he got here it's
got<00:03:59.639> nothing<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.060> here<00:04:00.239> okay<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.019> guess<00:04:01.290> this

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
got nothing in here okay so I guess this

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.750 
got nothing in here okay so I guess this
is<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.620> like<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.980> warehouse<00:04:02.340> power<00:04:02.579> where

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
is just like the warehouse power where

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.580 
is just like the warehouse power where
all<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.480> stuff<00:04:03.690> would<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.870> stored<00:04:04.230> that's

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
all the stuff would be stored that's

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.949 
all the stuff would be stored that's
kind<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.829> cool<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.629> by<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:06.690> way<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.840> should

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959
