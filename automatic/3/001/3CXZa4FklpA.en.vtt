that is has been in the past done by

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.390 
that is has been in the past done by
devices<00:00:31.750> but<00:00:31.930> now<00:00:32.140> there<00:00:32.500> are<00:00:32.619> apps<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.160> do<00:00:33.280> the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
devices but now there are apps to do the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.490 
devices but now there are apps to do the
same<00:00:33.670> or<00:00:34.060> similar<00:00:34.360> things<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.260> might
