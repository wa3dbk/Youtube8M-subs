00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.599 

hey<00:00:02.159> guys<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.790> quick<00:00:02.909> update<00:00:04.370> it<00:00:05.370> looks

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
hey guys this is a quick update it looks

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.209 
hey guys this is a quick update it looks
worse<00:00:05.850> than<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.390> actually<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.930> but<00:00:10.099> had<00:00:11.099> to

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
worse than it actually is but had to

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.810 
worse than it actually is but had to
take<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> motor<00:00:11.670> off<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.590> I<00:00:13.590> tried<00:00:14.370> starting

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
take the motor off and I tried starting

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.920 
take the motor off and I tried starting
it<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.389> wouldn't<00:00:15.900> start<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:17.930> initially

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it and it wouldn't start so I initially

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.790 
it and it wouldn't start so I initially
thought<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.949> problem<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.900> timing

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
thought that the problem was the timing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.750 
thought that the problem was the timing
marks<00:00:23.100> remember<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> there's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:25.220> two<00:00:26.220> zeros

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
marks remember that there's a two zeros

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.670 
marks remember that there's a two zeros
that<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> line<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> cam<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that you have to line up on the cam and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.700 
that you have to line up on the cam and
on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> crank<00:00:29.279> gear<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.869> I<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.289> lined

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on the crank gear and I know I lined

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
on the crank gear and I know I lined
those<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.210> maybe<00:00:33.570> thought<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> did

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
those up so I just maybe thought I did

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.560 
those up so I just maybe thought I did
something<00:00:34.500> wrong<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.030> while<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> was<00:00:36.270> pulling

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
something wrong so while I was pulling

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
something wrong so while I was pulling
it<00:00:36.780> apart<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.670> only<00:00:38.940> took<00:00:39.120> maybe<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:40.070> half

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it apart and this only took maybe a half

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
it apart and this only took maybe a half
hour<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.760> tear<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.640> when<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
hour to tear into it so when I what I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.439 
hour to tear into it so when I what I
noticed<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.940> flywheel<00:00:48.230> there's<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
noticed was the flywheel there's a

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.220 
noticed was the flywheel there's a
there's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> plastic<00:00:51.870> cap<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.910> goes<00:00:57.230> where

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
there's a plastic cap that goes where

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.090 
there's a plastic cap that goes where
the<00:00:58.260> magneto<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.960> marked<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.890> hard

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the magneto is and it's marked it's hard

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.320 
the magneto is and it's marked it's hard
to<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:04.470> marked<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.760> plastic

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to see but it's marked on this plastic

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.859 
to see but it's marked on this plastic
cap<00:01:07.850> flywheel<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.720> thought

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
cap flywheel side and I just thought

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
cap flywheel side and I just thought
that<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> plastic<00:01:14.159> simple<00:01:14.939> plastic

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that this was a plastic simple plastic

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
that this was a plastic simple plastic
cap<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.930> didn't<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.130> was

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
cap I didn't really think there was

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.219 
cap I didn't really think there was
anything<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
anything to it

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
anything to it
but<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> turned<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.490> noticed<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
but when I turned it over I noticed that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.730 
but when I turned it over I noticed that
there's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.729> thicker<00:01:23.729> part<00:01:24.210> over<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
there's a thicker part over here and I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
there's a thicker part over here and I
had<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.340> had<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.850> installed<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:28.049> goes<00:01:28.290> on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
had I had it installed this only goes on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
had I had it installed this only goes on
one<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.340> there's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
one way because there's a you can see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.190 
one way because there's a you can see
the<00:01:30.990> keyway<00:01:31.729> well<00:01:32.729> instead<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> putting<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the keyway well instead of putting it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.060 
the keyway well instead of putting it
this<00:01:34.860> way<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.780> installed<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.500> way<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
this way I installed it this way and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
this way I installed it this way and
what<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> didn't<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
what I didn't know is that there's a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.880 
what I didn't know is that there's a
magnet<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:43.110> magnet<00:01:43.619> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
magnet right there and that magnet is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
magnet right there and that magnet is
what<00:01:44.520> tells<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:47.600> plugs<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.350> know

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
what tells the the plugs to you know

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.850 
what tells the the plugs to you know
fire<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.509> actually<00:01:51.689> firing<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.590> spark

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fire so I was actually firing the spark

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.499 
fire so I was actually firing the spark
plugs<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> wrong<00:01:54.259> timing<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.509> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
plugs at the wrong timing with the and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.859 
plugs at the wrong timing with the and
the<00:01:57.630> compression<00:01:58.140> stroke<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.540> that's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the compression stroke so I think that's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
the compression stroke so I think that's
why<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.140> wouldn't<00:02:01.409> start<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.969> going

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
why it wouldn't start so now I'm going

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.950 
why it wouldn't start so now I'm going
to<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.810> know<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
to put it in this way and you know I I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.690 
to put it in this way and you know I I
didn't<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.649> thought<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> was<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> plastic

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
didn't I just thought this was a plastic

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.140 
didn't I just thought this was a plastic
cap<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.009> feel<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
cap but now that I feel it you can I can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.830 
cap but now that I feel it you can I can
clearly<00:02:12.629> tell<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.349> have<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
clearly tell that they have a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.160 
clearly tell that they have a
magnate<00:02:14.500> buried<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:16.060> that'll<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:16.989> on

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
magnate buried in here so that'll go on

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.250 
magnate buried in here so that'll go on
the<00:02:17.349> right<00:02:17.560> way<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.450> my<00:02:19.660> timing<00:02:19.989> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the right way and I know my timing is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.080 
the right way and I know my timing is
good<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.860> did<00:02:21.700> take<00:02:22.030> off<00:02:22.239> one<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.720> valves<00:02:24.090> so

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
good I did take off one of the valves so

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.259 
good I did take off one of the valves so
I'm<00:02:25.180> gonna<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.510> buttoning<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.230> all<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
I'm gonna be buttoning that all up and

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.309 
I'm gonna be buttoning that all up and
now<00:02:28.269> when<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:28.599> home<00:02:28.720> from<00:02:28.750> work<00:02:29.050> today

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
now when I get home from work today

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.680
