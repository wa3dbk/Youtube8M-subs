00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.260 

from<00:00:05.450> the<00:00:05.570> very<00:00:05.690> beginning<00:00:06.340> the<00:00:07.340> iPad<00:00:08.090> was

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.270 
from the very beginning the iPad was

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.450 
from the very beginning the iPad was
designed<00:00:08.720> to<00:00:08.960> be<00:00:09.170> very<00:00:09.530> powerful<00:00:09.860> very

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.680 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:11.180> but<00:00:11.890> also<00:00:13.030> remarkably<00:00:14.030> simple<00:00:14.540> to

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.480 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:16.660> so<00:00:17.660> our<00:00:17.840> goal<00:00:18.170> was<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.950> take<00:00:19.130> all<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
use so our goal was to take all the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.609 
use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:19.820> things<00:00:20.150> that<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:21.140> can<00:00:21.169> do<00:00:21.439> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.920 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:22.070> iPad<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.150> pack<00:00:23.480> them<00:00:23.660> into<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.529> is<00:00:24.770> so<00:00:25.130> much<00:00:25.369> smaller<00:00:25.700> and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.990 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:27.410> what<00:00:27.680> we<00:00:27.800> did<00:00:28.070> with<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:28.849> new<00:00:28.970> iPad

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
iPad and just reduce it all that you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.809 
iPad and just reduce it all that you
would<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.210> aware<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:57.740> was<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:59.369> everything

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
would be aware of was was everything

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.490

that<00:01:59.940> was<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.090> missing<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.080> there<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that was just missing that there is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.149 
that was just missing that there is
inherent<00:02:01.950> loss<00:02:02.429> in<00:02:03.330> just<00:02:03.810> reducing<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.800> product

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
inherent loss in just reducing a product

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.020

inside<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.319> did<00:02:07.649> was<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.700> went<00:02:08.850> back

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
inside and what we did was we went back

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
inside and what we did was we went back
to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> very<00:02:09.330> beginning<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.289> took<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to the very beginning and we took the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
to the very beginning and we took the
time<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.670> design<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> product<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.840> was<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
time to design a product that was a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.920 
time to design a product that was a
concentration<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> reduction<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
concentration of not a reduction of the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.720 
concentration of not a reduction of the
original<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:18.239> felt<00:02:18.540> strongly<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.730> 7.9

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
original we felt strongly that 7.9

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.180 
original we felt strongly that 7.9
inches<00:02:21.209> was<00:02:21.840> exactly<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> right<00:02:22.709> display

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
inches was exactly the right display

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.690 
inches was exactly the right display
size<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> became<00:02:25.019> clear<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.310> had<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
size but it became clear that we had to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
size but it became clear that we had to
reduce<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.239> width<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.110> borders<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
reduce the width of the borders so you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.280 
reduce the width of the borders so you
can<00:02:29.610> still<00:02:29.940> pick<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.329> up<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.660> easily<00:02:31.049> use<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
can still pick it up and easily use it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.630 
can still pick it up and easily use it
with<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.739> hand<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.100> continued<00:02:35.610> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
with one hand we have continued to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.470 
with one hand we have continued to
develop<00:02:36.269> our<00:02:36.660> unibody<00:02:37.320> process<00:02:38.390> there<00:02:39.390> are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
develop our unibody process there are

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.750 
develop our unibody process there are
essentially<00:02:39.989> two<00:02:40.320> parts<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> enclosure

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760

the glass than the aluminium and that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.819 
the glass than the aluminium and that
Junction<00:02:45.630> where<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.170> two<00:02:46.320> parts<00:02:46.680> actually

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
Junction where the two parts actually

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.360 
Junction where the two parts actually
come<00:02:47.220> together<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:48.090> incredibly<00:02:48.560> important

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
come together is incredibly important

with the glass and I think it's a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.770
