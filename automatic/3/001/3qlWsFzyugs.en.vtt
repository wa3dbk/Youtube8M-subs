00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.849
 you could say confabulated with the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.980
 server decoration of the tour which has 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 one has a new modality that comes 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.940
 saying is wars 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.029
 wars yes I am pronouncing the view well 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.150
 the pronunciation is something is I have it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.570
 something weird I do not know I do not do well 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 they keep good things that none and then 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.590
 see you in this modality that comes 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.540
 being of wax in juarez which here you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.030
 it says all the instruction is like four 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.129
 same 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.840
 in the last time he survived the 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:45.010
 enemies of the last enemies that you 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.010
 break of basic egg 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.420
 that is, then 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.150
 There are people who ask me that I am crazy 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.060
 I do not know maybe I do not know I think so and 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.680
 Well, I have nothing to do if 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.300
 they comment and do in the answer that what 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.300
 the video wins because you know 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.890
 are some wands are five maps because 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.090
 just started is a week I think has 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.090
 had changes and then well then 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.170
 I do not know what to say the truth is that they are 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.330
 five maps as they are from kubica I think 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.920
 and so I'm going to show you the way to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.920
 start that is coming in here 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.409
 and then nothing else, this is simply 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.450
 very good because a lot to serve that not 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.719
 have this option I have entered thus 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.340
 be see if not premium clean and if not then 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.469
 they do not give you the option to choose a team 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.950
 simply the one that falls that way 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:45.469
 in choosing between green like this 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.360
 yellow and I can choose the hours only 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.310
 to show I think we're going to win 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.630
 just because it's a 1 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.140
 in fact it did not even start because it 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.579
 came out he created the post are four teams 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.289
 red green yellow and blue which has 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.659
 a space of 10 players and per game 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.060
 can be up to 40 people which in 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.250
 this series if it fills in 40 40 people 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.959
 this time because I do not know what I can 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.940
 be I think there is not the best benefit in 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.860
 the stadium has both lar and so because 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.500
 if I repeat you did a previous above of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.230
 let's see how the battle happens 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.090
 just like it's not working it's not 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.799
 my fault is not my problem I do not have 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.930
 nothing to see from the server 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.420
 begin feel my people 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.090
 is not working and he knows the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.099
 truth is that it's not my problem if 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.750
 it works not I just know what to show you 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.069
 of holly is in the description and then 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.159
 I designed them more or less like I was 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.500
 raised here and then these are the 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.389
 zone by then to wait for the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.040
 village which was already filled the team see the 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.379
 blue Team 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.209
 and suddenly then we're going to give you some 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.600
 simple and I will not play in the game 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.910
 decided to make the next video 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.590
 also something else we see ourselves not 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.060
 only to the people that I said in the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.770
 previous video because this simply 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 it's a meeting already in the video yes normal 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.220
 after the greeting but teach them that 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.720
 those deliveries 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.540
 the one in the description and I do not know 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.840
 because they start good and started this is 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.420
 one of the maps which they see has 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.890
 small the truth is that it's like 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.290
 any is like any other being 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.250
 will see initial have the initial such a 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.250
 I can not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.430
 does not have a little book and can not 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.290
 well when you start past more like this for the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.970
 blog has already resolved what's happening here sometimes 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.480
 did not leave villagers easy 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.540
 they are more than three tested villagers 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.000
 you get these ships that do not complete 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.180
 the map and in case you download them 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.330
 none a day is not the diagonal as you 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.190
 call 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.740
 villager kick so here's the grain 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.570
 and it gives you an egg of the day not the 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.960
 which can you put anywhere 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.380
 but I recommend that if yes, here 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.380
 none 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.760
 and then this month it's useful 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.810
 different but they gave him another 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.780
 different technique if it is different has 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.040
 this in this you only expose yourself good by 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.780
 say just put the iron on the diamond 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.190
 and gold you have everything in the center and so 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.110
 here only armor this 5 iron 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.050
 in a post and get it then you have 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.410
 something more difficult that I wanted several that 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.389
 start it is normal that these blocks 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.100
 What he recommended a lot is the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.350
 oxidizer do not buy sword of 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.200
 obsidian colorina this one gives us 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.930
 we wanted glass I do not know either mount 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.480
 calm unit lasted the food of this 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.540
 food 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.100
 it's simple to get after that already 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.650
 you are in the center is simple to 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.230
 get the arcs are somewhat difficult 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.670
 to contrast and color this yes yes 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.430
 someone is watching someone from the server 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.060
 here I recommend that if you can 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.100
 change because eight diamonds to 12 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.470
 Claver that exists different and has no 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.770
 nothing 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.390
 the arrows and also so many peaks these 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.240
 but they only need if you in 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
 case that he had enemies in compost 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.860
 options in your game which have 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.020
 careful luck you put it on but 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.050
 if it is also a yacht that if I am contain 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.260
 The cited ones are yes and something 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.690
 important that it's not like that is not always 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.340
 is going to be demanding but it gives you the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.150
 option of doing you here since you are here 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.710
 this thing did not receive the ball well and 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.430
 it already comes out to you as if you want to have it 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.600
 as well as the prizes since it is in 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.460
 many people who have not done that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.370
 observation well you know how to use this 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.580
 for him so that he does not do it 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:53.200
 they always give you a time and then we have 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.440
 to the center more is not something that was taken from you 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.540
 I do not know why but you can not 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:04.170
 this being we get 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:07.150
 You can not wait for games 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:11.140
 because according to him the only bad thing he has 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.610
 right now and then myself and then I 'm going to 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:18.080
 teach how to enter from the beginning 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.670
 and good and then teach to comment 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.430
 yes 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.130
 well this is something simple and if not 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.800
 you want if you do not want to use the is which 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.210
 you can all put them server 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.120
 wars and already takes a lens leads and 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.130
 to leave only the color 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.200
 and it already takes you loop is obvious in this thing 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.330
 simple only that because by any 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.320
 people who can not forgive the dog 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.320
 but I can not shut up 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.849
 let's put light 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.160
 which we can make from the cake and 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.139
 is here and edward online 80 which is 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.509
 right now and produce more than you have 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.300
 the servef to my missions in the cia better 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:05.660
 the sky I keep more than it is for some 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.020
 he almost did not enter anymore and that was 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.020
 all 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.300
 maybe it's here in the description and 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:16.180
 the explanation is the instruction are and 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.889
 they do not know what else to tell you is the 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.900
 I invite you to share the 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.270
 video of jesus lake if you want if not 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.129
 Well, I'm not seeing anything and we 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.909
 we see in a next until the next 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.909
 there are videos
