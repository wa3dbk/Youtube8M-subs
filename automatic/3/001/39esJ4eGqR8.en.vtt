00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
them at michaels for just a couple of

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.060 
them at michaels for just a couple of
dollars

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
dollars

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.189 
dollars
however<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.820> colors<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.659> patterns<00:00:50.809> that

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
however the colors and the patterns that

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.530 
however the colors and the patterns that
they<00:00:51.320> came<00:00:51.530> with<00:00:51.710> are<00:00:51.979> really<00:00:52.280> cheesy<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.120> i

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
they came with are really cheesy and i

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
think i can make it look better with

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.610 
think i can make it look better with
just<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.489> few<00:00:55.699> cans<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.360> spray<00:00:56.690> paint<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.470> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
just a few cans of spray paint so the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.530 
just a few cans of spray paint so the
first<00:00:57.830> thing<00:00:58.040> i'm<00:00:58.190> going<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.460> do<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.970> tape<00:00:59.330> off

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
first thing i'm going to do is tape off

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.110 
first thing i'm going to do is tape off
the<00:00:59.570> stems<00:01:00.080> with<00:01:00.530> painters<00:01:01.040> tape<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.699> isn't

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the stems with painters tape this isn't

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
the stems with painters tape this isn't
completely<00:01:02.299> necessary<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.589> i<00:01:03.650> actually

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
completely necessary and i actually

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.100 
completely necessary and i actually
ended<00:01:04.070> up<00:01:04.309> painting<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.820> stems<00:01:05.089> later<00:01:05.479> anyway

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
ended up painting the stems later anyway

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.050 
ended up painting the stems later anyway
but<00:01:06.620> once<00:01:07.010> that<00:01:07.190> was<00:01:07.250> all<00:01:07.520> done<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.790> i<00:01:08.000> took

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
but once that was all done and i took

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.480 
but once that was all done and i took
them<00:01:08.420> outside<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:09.290> gave<00:01:09.470> them<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.830> base<00:01:10.190> coat

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
them outside and I gave them a base coat

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.969 
them outside and I gave them a base coat
in<00:01:10.820> white<00:01:11.150> again<00:01:11.780> not<00:01:12.229> completely<00:01:12.830> necessary

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
in white again not completely necessary

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.100 
in white again not completely necessary
but<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.880> wanted<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.240> make<00:01:14.360> sure<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.780> none<00:01:15.080> of

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
but I wanted to make sure that none of

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.200 
but I wanted to make sure that none of
the<00:01:15.320> ugly<00:01:15.770> patterns<00:01:16.159> were<00:01:16.430> going<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.909> show

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
the ugly patterns were going to show

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.940 
the ugly patterns were going to show
through<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:17.840> once<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.229> white<00:01:18.409> paint<00:01:18.710> was<00:01:18.890> dry

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
through so once the white paint was dry

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.850 
through so once the white paint was dry
I<00:01:19.520> painted<00:01:20.000> them<00:01:20.119> each<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.570> solid<00:01:21.080> color<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.710> I

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
I painted them each a solid color and I

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.710 
I painted them each a solid color and I
painted<00:01:22.190> them<00:01:22.340> all<00:01:22.430> within<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:23.000> same<00:01:23.240> kind<00:01:23.690> of

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
painted them all within the same kind of

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.350 
painted them all within the same kind of
fall<00:01:24.020> color<00:01:24.500> scheme<00:01:24.950> using<00:01:25.700> golds<00:01:26.180> and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
fall color scheme using golds and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.420 
fall color scheme using golds and
Silver's<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.870> this<00:01:27.290> ridiculously<00:01:28.100> bright

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
Silver's and this ridiculously bright

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.270 
Silver's and this ridiculously bright
orange<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.810> once<00:01:29.990> those<00:01:30.230> were<00:01:30.260> completely<00:01:30.950> dry

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
orange so once those were completely dry

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.130 
orange so once those were completely dry
it<00:01:31.610> was<00:01:31.730> time<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.090> start<00:01:32.270> planning<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:32.930> kind

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
it was time to start planning what kind

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.500 
it was time to start planning what kind
of<00:01:33.200> patterns<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.950> wanted<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.460> paint<00:01:34.730> on<00:01:34.970> them<00:01:35.240> I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
of patterns I wanted to paint on them I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.420 
of patterns I wanted to paint on them I
actually<00:01:35.720> really<00:01:36.230> like<00:01:36.560> how<00:01:36.800> they<00:01:36.950> look<00:01:37.190> as

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
actually really like how they look as

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.940 
actually really like how they look as
just<00:01:37.820> solid<00:01:38.210> colors<00:01:38.570> especially<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.710> gold

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
just solid colors especially the gold

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.610 
just solid colors especially the gold
and<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.520> bright<00:01:40.790> shiny<00:01:41.180> orange<00:01:41.510> so<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.440> could

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
and the bright shiny orange so you could

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.130 
and the bright shiny orange so you could
stop<00:01:42.980> here<00:01:43.010> if<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.640> wanted<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.120> but<00:01:44.480> I<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:45.110> a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
stop here if you wanted to but I have a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.590 
stop here if you wanted to but I have a
few<00:01:45.500> more<00:01:45.680> ideas<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.400> my<00:01:46.430> sleeve<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
few more ideas up my sleeve so for the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.450 
few more ideas up my sleeve so for the
first<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.200> going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.650> use<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.920> piece<00:01:49.220> of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
first one I'm going to use this piece of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.270 
first one I'm going to use this piece of
lace<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:50.240> mask<00:01:50.570> off<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.170> pumpkin<00:01:51.620> I<00:01:51.860> cut<00:01:52.100> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
lace to mask off the pumpkin I cut a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.940 
lace to mask off the pumpkin I cut a
small<00:01:52.610> hole<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.390> stem<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.020> then<00:01:54.470> used<00:01:54.740> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
small hole for the stem and then used a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.430 
small hole for the stem and then used a
rubber<00:01:55.220> band<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.910> hold<00:01:56.150> it<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.570> place<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.260> then

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
rubber band to hold it in place and then

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.930 
rubber band to hold it in place and then
I'm<00:01:57.560> hoping<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.040> pattern<00:01:58.430> from<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.760> lace

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
I'm hoping the pattern from the lace

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270 
I'm hoping the pattern from the lace
will<00:01:59.510> transfer<00:01:59.990> onto<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.530> pumpkin<00:02:00.920> when<00:02:01.250> I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
will transfer onto the pumpkin when I

and brought them inside to start taking

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.530 
and brought them inside to start taking
off<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.440> tape<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.950> love<00:03:33.700> how<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.209> color

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
off the tape I love how this color

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.660 
off the tape I love how this color
blocked<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.110> turned<00:03:35.470> out<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.250> was<00:03:36.430> so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
blocked one turned out and it was so

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.120 
blocked one turned out and it was so
easy<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.180> make<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.810> was<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.230> nervous<00:03:38.410> taking<00:03:38.920> off

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
easy to make I was so nervous taking off

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.100 
easy to make I was so nervous taking off
the<00:03:39.370> first<00:03:39.640> fishnet<00:03:40.209> but<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> pattern

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
the first fishnet but the pattern

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.229 
the first fishnet but the pattern
actually<00:03:41.440> did<00:03:42.070> transfer<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:42.940> think<00:03:43.150> it

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
actually did transfer and I think it

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.120 
actually did transfer and I think it
looks<00:03:43.360> really<00:03:43.720> cool<00:03:44.019> same<00:03:44.620> with<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.010> other

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
looks really cool same with the other

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.280 
looks really cool same with the other
one<00:03:45.370> which<00:03:45.760> brings<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.269> bit<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.480> orange<00:03:46.690> into

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
one which brings a bit of orange into

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.289 
one which brings a bit of orange into
the<00:03:47.380> mix<00:03:47.560> without<00:03:47.890> being<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:48.489> gaudy<00:03:48.850> and

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
the mix without being really gaudy and

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.360 
the mix without being really gaudy and
in-your-face<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.410> least<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:50.860> was<00:03:51.100> what<00:03:51.340> I

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
in-your-face the least one was what I

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.490 
in-your-face the least one was what I
was<00:03:51.700> most<00:03:52.000> worried<00:03:52.450> about<00:03:52.660> but<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.079> pattern

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
was most worried about but the pattern

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.280 
was most worried about but the pattern
actually<00:03:53.890> looks<00:03:54.610> kind<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.269> amazing<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:56.110> gets

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
actually looks kind of amazing it gets

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.020 
actually looks kind of amazing it gets
kind<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.590> blurry<00:03:56.829> on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.220> curves<00:03:57.489> but<00:03:57.790> then

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
kind of blurry on the curves but then

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.390 
kind of blurry on the curves but then
it's<00:03:58.180> clear<00:03:58.570> up<00:03:58.810> top<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.410> love<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.799> and<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.160> drip

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
it's clear up top I love it and the drip

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.670 
it's clear up top I love it and the drip
one<00:04:00.579> looks<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.420> cool<00:04:01.600> as<00:04:01.780> well<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.350> black

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
one looks really cool as well like black

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.009 
one looks really cool as well like black
blood<00:04:03.070> dripping<00:04:03.880> down<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> side<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.450> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
blood dripping down the side and the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.110 
blood dripping down the side and the
only<00:04:05.049> one<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.410> wasn't<00:04:05.950> too<00:04:06.190> thrilled<00:04:06.220> about<00:04:06.700> was

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
only one I wasn't too thrilled about was

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.690 
only one I wasn't too thrilled about was
this<00:04:07.299> gourd<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.290> after<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.890> first<00:04:09.130> layer<00:04:09.310> I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
this gourd so after the first layer I

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.000 
this gourd so after the first layer I
covered<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.239> with<00:04:10.269> tape<00:04:10.630> again<00:04:10.930> spray<00:04:11.590> painted

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
covered it with tape again spray painted

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.979 
covered it with tape again spray painted
it<00:04:12.100> again<00:04:12.340> peppered<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.180> with<00:04:13.299> tape<00:04:13.540> again

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
it again peppered it with tape again

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.870 
it again peppered it with tape again
spray<00:04:14.680> painted<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.190> again

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
spray painted it again

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.150 
spray painted it again
and<00:04:15.970> then<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.750> think<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:17.049> looks<00:04:17.229> so<00:04:17.440> awesome<00:04:17.470> now

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
and then I think it looks so awesome now

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.009 
and then I think it looks so awesome now
with<00:04:18.400> all<00:04:18.609> these<00:04:18.760> different<00:04:18.970> colors<00:04:19.419> in<00:04:19.780> such

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
with all these different colors in such

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.140 
with all these different colors in such
a<00:04:20.049> weird<00:04:20.560> pattern<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.729> only<00:04:21.880> thing<00:04:22.120> left

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
a weird pattern so the only thing left

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.140 
a weird pattern so the only thing left
to<00:04:22.390> finish<00:04:22.600> was<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.410> stems<00:04:23.880> taking<00:04:24.880> off<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
to finish was the stems taking off the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.690 
to finish was the stems taking off the
tape<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.600> wasn't<00:04:25.930> too<00:04:26.200> thrilled<00:04:26.490> with<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
tape I wasn't too thrilled with the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.510 
tape I wasn't too thrilled with the
original<00:04:28.330> color<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.260> stems<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:30.370> some

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
original color of the stems so for some

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.520 
original color of the stems so for some
of<00:04:30.610> them<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.940> used<00:04:31.180> black<00:04:31.539> acrylic<00:04:31.930> paint<00:04:32.140> to

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
of them I used black acrylic paint to

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.529 
of them I used black acrylic paint to
just<00:04:32.800> darken<00:04:33.160> them<00:04:33.280> up<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.760> for<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.030> others<00:04:34.270> I

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
just darken them up and for the others I

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.839 
just darken them up and for the others I
cut<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.930> hole<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> piece<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:36.160> card<00:04:36.550> stock<00:04:36.580> to

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
cut a hole in a piece of card stock to

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.240 
cut a hole in a piece of card stock to
use<00:04:37.180> as<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> shield<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:38.110> then<00:04:38.530> spray-painted

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
use as a shield and then spray-painted

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.540 
use as a shield and then spray-painted
just<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.760> stems

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
just the stems

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.190 
just the stems
when<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.790> took<00:04:40.910> off<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.210> paper<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.900> stems

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
when I took off the paper the stems

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.230 
when I took off the paper the stems
looked<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:42.860> much<00:04:43.010> better<00:04:43.250> but<00:04:43.670> it<00:04:43.940> would<00:04:44.150> have

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
looked so much better but it would have

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.090 
looked so much better but it would have
saved<00:04:44.450> me<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.750> lot<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.140> trouble<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.740> just<00:04:45.920> paint

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
saved me a lot of trouble to just paint

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.950 
saved me a lot of trouble to just paint
them<00:04:46.340> at<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.670> same<00:04:46.820> time<00:04:47.120> they<00:04:47.450> did<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.780> rest

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
them at the same time they did the rest

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.050 
them at the same time they did the rest
of<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.200> colors<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:49.130> that's<00:04:49.490> what<00:04:49.700> I<00:04:49.730> would

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
of the colors so that's what I would

00:04:50.060 --> 00:05:02.570 
of the colors so that's what I would
recommend<00:04:50.210> if<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.020> do<00:04:51.260> this<00:04:51.380> project

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.760 

and<00:05:03.210> that's<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.990> result<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.590> my

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
and that's the result of my

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.880 
and that's the result of my
spray-painted<00:05:05.490> pumpkin<00:05:05.940> project<00:05:06.600> /

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890
