00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
you can keep working with the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.429 
you can keep working with the
accomplished<00:01:45.880> beginners<00:01:46.299> blender<00:01:46.689> tutorials

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
accomplished beginners blender tutorials

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.320 
accomplished beginners blender tutorials
they're<00:01:47.680> not<00:01:47.890> as<00:01:48.070> sequential<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.030> do<00:01:49.180> it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
they're not as sequential you can do it

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.500 
they're not as sequential you can do it
you<00:01:49.540> know<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.750> any<00:01:50.200> order<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.939> such<00:01:52.270> but<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:55.390> of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
you know in any order as such but one of

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.740 
you know in any order as such but one of
my<00:01:55.630> thoughts<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.820> do<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
my thoughts is that if you do the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.350 
my thoughts is that if you do the
tutorials<00:01:59.290> then<00:01:59.470> you'll<00:01:59.920> have<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.820> files<00:02:01.119> the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
tutorials then you'll have the files the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.990 
tutorials then you'll have the files the
materials<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.799> complete<00:02:03.549> more

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
materials so that you can complete more

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.749 
materials so that you can complete more
of<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.330> later<00:02:04.659> for<00:02:05.140> instance<00:02:05.409> when<00:02:06.189> you<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.520> to

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
of it later for instance when you get to

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.419 
of it later for instance when you get to
some<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.270> lighting<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.679> presentation

some of the lighting and presentation

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.450 
some of the lighting and presentation
then<00:02:10.379> there's

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
then there's

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
the tutorial but this way that's my idea

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.040 
the tutorial but this way that's my idea
throughout<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.400> there's<00:02:51.820> nothing<00:02:52.780> secret

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
throughout that there's nothing secret

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.190 
throughout that there's nothing secret
nothing<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.610> if<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.540> follow<00:02:55.840> through

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
nothing that you if you follow through

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.190 
nothing that you if you follow through
these<00:02:57.000> tutorials<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.420> should<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.810> all<00:02:59.020> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
these tutorials you should have all the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.470 
these tutorials you should have all the
skills<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.920> abilities<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.490> actually<00:03:01.270> do

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
skills and the abilities to actually do

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.990 
skills and the abilities to actually do
what<00:03:01.870> I'm<00:03:01.990> talking<00:03:02.500> about<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.850> is

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
what I'm talking about so that that is

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570 
what I'm talking about so that that is
my<00:03:04.180> one<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:04.840> basic<00:03:05.320> points<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.280> try<00:03:06.520> to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
my one of my basic points is to try to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.820 
my one of my basic points is to try to
to<00:03:08.700> introduce<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:09.940> concepts<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.110> allows

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
to introduce you to concepts that allows

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.030 
to introduce you to concepts that allows
you<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.490> move<00:03:12.820> forward<00:03:13.300> in<00:03:13.450> your<00:03:14.040> building

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
you to move forward in your building

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.980 
you to move forward in your building
your<00:03:15.160> skill<00:03:15.430> set<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.240> those<00:03:16.450> skills

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
your skill set and one of those skills

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.010 
your skill set and one of those skills
are<00:03:17.430> using<00:03:18.430> particle<00:03:18.850> systems<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.840> that's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
are using particle systems so that's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.460 
are using particle systems so that's
kind<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.530> fun<00:03:20.800> part<00:03:21.640> or<00:03:21.970> here<00:03:22.810> we're<00:03:23.080> using<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
kind of a fun part or here we're using a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.470 
kind of a fun part or here we're using a
portal<00:03:23.800> particle<00:03:24.400> system<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.850> create<00:03:25.120> hair

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
portal particle system to create hair

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.410 
portal particle system to create hair
and<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.990> see<00:03:26.140> one<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.710> of<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:28.000> errors

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
and you can see one of the of the errors

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.680 
and you can see one of the of the errors
is<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:30.040> don't<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.400> collision<00:03:31.000> here

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
is that we don't have collision here

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.930 
is that we don't have collision here
with<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.590> objects<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> hair<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:33.820> know

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
with the objects of the hair you know

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.930 
with the objects of the hair you know
pokes<00:03:34.210> through<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.720> actual<00:03:35.140> object<00:03:35.620> but

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
pokes through the actual object but

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.300 
pokes through the actual object but
that's<00:03:36.940> because<00:03:37.330> at<00:03:37.990> that<00:03:38.170> time<00:03:38.310> blender

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
that's because at that time blender

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.240 
that's because at that time blender
didn't<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:40.000> hair<00:03:40.870> coalition<00:03:41.380> turn<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.830> for

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
didn't have hair coalition turn on for

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.440 
didn't have hair coalition turn on for
four<00:03:42.580> objects<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.650> there's<00:03:45.130> also<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.790> couple

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
four objects and there's also a couple

four objects and there's also a couple
of<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:49.480> know<00:03:49.600> with<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.780> light<00:03:50.110> and

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
of you know with the light and

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.520 
of you know with the light and
presentation<00:03:51.010> playlist<00:03:51.850> look<00:03:52.810> at<00:03:52.960> that<00:03:53.140> real

is about you know your light rigs and
how<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:13.140> put<00:04:14.140> things<00:04:14.379> in<00:04:14.620> focus<00:04:15.069> through

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
how you can put things in focus through

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.879 
how you can put things in focus through

unknown than those my think it's my
video<00:04:23.440> card<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.830> stumbling<00:04:24.160> on<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.699> I<00:04:24.910> have

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
video card is stumbling on this I have

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.480 
video card is stumbling on this I have
too<00:04:25.870> many<00:04:26.020> processes<00:04:26.740> running<00:04:27.070> at<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.370> same

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
too many processes running at the same

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.210 
too many processes running at the same
time<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.000> I'll<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.330> quit<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.220> then

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
time so I'll just to quit that and then

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.689 
time so I'll just to quit that and then
we<00:04:30.340> have<00:04:30.520> also<00:04:32.100> something<00:04:33.100> about<00:04:33.280> background

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
we have also something about background

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.640 
we have also something about background
using<00:04:34.120> an<00:04:34.360> image<00:04:34.630> as<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> background<00:04:35.050> here<00:04:35.590> you

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
using an image as a background here you

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.170 
using an image as a background here you
can<00:04:35.800> see<00:04:35.919> when<00:04:36.070> you're<00:04:36.190> using<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.520> paper<00:04:36.729> image

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
can see when you're using a paper image

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.879 
can see when you're using a paper image
it<00:04:37.360> looks<00:04:37.570> kind<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.840> funny<00:04:38.050> right<00:04:38.410> because<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
it looks kind of funny right because the

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.719 
it looks kind of funny right because the
sky's<00:04:39.330> still<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.020> earth<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.530> moving<00:04:41.740> so

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
sky's still and the earth is moving so

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.890 
sky's still and the earth is moving so
the<00:04:42.820> way<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:42.970> do<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.660> is<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.960> do<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.770> real

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
the way to do that is to do the real

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.029 
the way to do that is to do the real
real<00:04:46.900> background<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:47.680> you'll<00:04:47.830> learn<00:04:47.979> more

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
real background but you'll learn more

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.860 
real background but you'll learn more
about<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.789> later<00:04:49.030> if<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:50.849> care<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:51.880> view<00:04:52.660> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
about that later if you care to view the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:06.059 
about that later if you care to view the
tutorials<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.789> there's<00:04:57.789> a<00:04:57.880> little<00:04:58.180> car<00:04:58.330> again

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.729 

and<00:05:07.069> here's<00:05:07.519> just<00:05:07.909> a<00:05:07.999> view<00:05:08.209> of<00:05:08.799> one<00:05:09.799> of<00:05:10.009> them

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
and here's just a view of one of them

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.199 
and here's just a view of one of them
blender<00:05:12.739> files<00:05:13.009> this<00:05:13.339> is<00:05:13.489> the<00:05:13.729> one<00:05:13.909> where<00:05:14.119> you

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.209 
blender files this is the one where you

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.849 
blender files this is the one where you
create<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.599> car<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:16.129> the<00:05:16.639> it<00:05:17.359> covers<00:05:18.079> you

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:18.859 
create the car and the it covers you

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:23.109 
create the car and the it covers you
know<00:05:18.979> modeling<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:21.549> a<00:05:22.549> little<00:05:22.819> bit<00:05:22.939> about

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:23.119 
know modeling and a little bit about

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:28.449 
know modeling and a little bit about
materials<00:05:26.049> but<00:05:27.049> that's<00:05:27.259> basically<00:05:27.439> yet<00:05:28.009> for

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:28.459 
materials but that's basically yet for

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:36.279 
materials but that's basically yet for
this<00:05:33.309> am<00:05:34.309> I<00:05:34.489> idea<00:05:34.729> with<00:05:35.149> all<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.869> these<00:05:35.959> is<00:05:36.259> that

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
this am I idea with all of these is that

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.649 
this am I idea with all of these is that
this<00:05:36.949> should<00:05:37.219> allow<00:05:37.849> you<00:05:37.909> the<00:05:38.239> quickest

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
this should allow you the quickest

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:44.619 
this should allow you the quickest
possible<00:05:38.869> access<00:05:39.589> to<00:05:39.769> blender<00:05:42.039> and<00:05:43.479> also<00:05:44.479> if

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
possible access to blender and also if

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:45.939 
possible access to blender and also if
you're<00:05:44.839> a<00:05:44.869> little<00:05:45.199> bit<00:05:45.319> more<00:05:45.469> accomplished

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
you're a little bit more accomplished

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.339 
you're a little bit more accomplished
