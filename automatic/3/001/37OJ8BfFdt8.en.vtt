 Athlete and Nongshim Shirley Nguyen, who had a good performance in the competition, 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 Anyone can afford a 50 to 50 bride. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.520
 However , there is someone who worries about the order to start the game. 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.399
 POSCO Chemtech Kim Sung Yong Tomdo 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:48.180
 If you meet easily, I will not be able to do my skill, 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.920
 Ryan really Players do not solve the bishop's concern 8th 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 Does not the gum go out 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:00.120
 I will first provoke Nae-Hyun Son, the alleged relative of my usual enemies. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 While South Korea professor week eojju use the pups do a cavity corresponding nayeon player 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 I have something fun. 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.479
 4 is completed aneunde thought surely will go cut the score is not always 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.729
 102 this way 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.240
 3 When you poke 4 If you give it this way, the connection is possible. 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:25.270
 LA Now is not talking like I lost the strap temyeon 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.780
 Anyway, the bag is now swimming in the air. 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.080
 I do not. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:36.940
 4 Knowing that Na-yeon is also cut off 4 5 2 2 1 Sensitivity 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.899
 Since the situation can still see it until he broke it and black lead 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.220
 Song 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:45.250
 Surely the simplest thing to keep the weakness 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 If you now go to the center with a whiteness date 4 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.770
 Anyway, I made two points and said a lively word. 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.800
 I go. [Chuckles] Well you can get a little mirror on the Singh hit the dirt Vegas 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.600
 It is OK to line up and spread words 4 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.890
 Once the event went on like this, it was 102 trillion heavier. 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 Whether it was the first place we made these two points really correct to take it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.780
 I do not know. Yeah. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.670
 I will fight here because I will not be back in the first place . 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.910
 The same 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.940
 So leave the milking while mitgu 4 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.270
 Money Wuhan 102 It's a little painful 4 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.800
 Anyway, I did it right away. 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:34.750
 Anyway, then this is a good 102 . 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.700
 Now I turn off the tip and I heard the screams from the table. 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.290
 What do you mean I do not know what the good people who are keen Professor ends 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.290
 Is there a natural relationship? 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.360
 It means that you are a child. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 However, given that the nucleus from Still no monarch has a very bold choice 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.450
 It is judgment 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.650
 I'm making a mistake at the handball game in the eyeballs . 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.319
 If you come to the entrance , you will be able to catch one point with the number of grabbing 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.200
 I expected to be in the dirt. 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.370
 I'm in danger of being caught in a window when I'm caught 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.660
 Could this be the world? 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:23.690
 An Bukchon athlete was in a fight and made a mistake, but how did he win? 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.680
 I have to be afraid of it. 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 have 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:35.140
 Find me. Yeah. You were the teacher . When you say it, it's too easy. 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.140
 I got better results from illusions. 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:44.420
 I can hang with me unconditionally and I think you supposed to write all those designed jjaro 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:50.570
 But the two houses are not all narrative forms, 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.070
 Did you kill your feet when you came to drink, or you hid some professors? 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.210
 I guess it was 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.210
 Show the Anguk one thousand and four weeks between fear predators Wu 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 The left is cooked and it is really ah 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:15.099
 Oh, that's true. 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:20.350
 If you leave it at 100 2, you stay here at a glance 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:25.210
 I had to go out to the house to have a taste of it , but before that, 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.830
 Yes , you have to put a lot of food in your yurus free before you buy it. 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.360
 It's 100 points. 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.370
 Even if you get 1 point again , there is a replacement before that, 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.470
 I got a lot of money . 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:44.520
 4 Now, now that Black is going to take a step in this way and catch it 4 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.150
 I think I'll be able to finish the transition to embellish Let the number three laid mine 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.340
 I need it. 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.499
 Leave this place 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.949
 This is progressing. 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:58.340
 I'm going to sing and sing. 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:02.180
 4 North Korea throws away 2 points for 2 points 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:07.639
 I learned a lot behind you and beat you. 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.639
 4 For beating back here now requires a singular fixture Black is back and why 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.370
 Yes, in this scene 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:18.010
 Ambition 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:22.300
 We have to hit it . We have to make it. We can not take the dirt right now. 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:29.290
 On the other hand, 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:33.940
 Is it possible to do this once? 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:38.919
 It's a fab fab. 4 There's no big deal . 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:43.810
 I see the players in the National Assembly so aggressively riding their opponents 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:49.210
 Looks like the opposite has also worked . 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.440
 It's great, it's a Korean player , 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.729
 Than 4 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:59.590
 It is wonderful to go to Korea and write it. 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:04.419
 To overcome nemesis relations discard drastically the usual style that resulted in the melee 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:11.789
 Iron claimed to be the player with the better deal calmly and myosu a big mistake Anguk cloth 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.789
 Sent to the players applauded Next time, I'll see to find more rare loosen specified 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.560
 Thank you.
