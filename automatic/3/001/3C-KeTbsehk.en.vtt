00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
restricted profile what that's going to

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.489 
restricted profile what that's going to
do<00:00:53.589> is<00:00:53.710> allow<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.309> restrict<00:00:54.519> certain<00:00:54.999> apps

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
do is allow you to restrict certain apps

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.649 
do is allow you to restrict certain apps
things<00:00:56.499> that<00:00:56.739> they<00:00:56.829> can<00:00:57.039> do<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.370> change<00:00:57.699> if

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
things that they can do and change if

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.779 
things that they can do and change if
for<00:00:59.289> example<00:00:59.859> you<00:00:59.920> don't<00:00:59.979> want<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.219> kid<00:01:00.489> going

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
for example you don't want a kid going

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.489 
for example you don't want a kid going
on<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.120> Internet<00:01:01.420> or<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.929> you<00:01:02.109> only<00:01:02.260> want<00:01:02.469> to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
on the Internet or that you only want to

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.140 
on the Internet or that you only want to
playing<00:01:02.739> certain<00:01:02.920> games<00:01:03.219> you<00:01:03.729> can<00:01:03.819> create<00:01:04.089> a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
playing certain games you can create a

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.480 
playing certain games you can create a
profile<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:04.960> for<00:01:05.199> them<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.890> they<00:01:06.009> can<00:01:06.040> go<00:01:06.310> on

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
profile just for them so they can go on

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.280 
profile just for them so they can go on
it<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:06.850> again<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.450> wouldn't<00:01:07.719> use<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:07.869> but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
it so again I wouldn't use it but

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.709 
it so again I wouldn't use it but
however<00:01:08.649> for<00:01:09.460> those<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:09.850> do<00:01:10.060> have<00:01:10.090> multiple

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
however for those that do have multiple

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.050 
however for those that do have multiple
people<00:01:11.110> using<00:01:11.619> your<00:01:11.950> tablet<00:01:12.250> then<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.850> might

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
people using your tablet then that might

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.100 
people using your tablet then that might
be<00:01:13.210> useful<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
be useful to you

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.950 
be useful to you
another<00:01:14.649> nice<00:01:14.920> new<00:01:15.159> change<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.700> with<00:01:16.119> 4.3<00:01:16.840> is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
another nice new change was with 4.3 is

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.289 
another nice new change was with 4.3 is
some<00:01:17.110> graphic<00:01:17.530> improvements<00:01:18.299> including

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
some graphic improvements including

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.109 
some graphic improvements including
OpenGL<00:01:19.899> ES<00:01:20.259> 3.0<00:01:20.890> which<00:01:21.460> basically<00:01:21.820> means

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
OpenGL ES 3.0 which basically means

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.429 
OpenGL ES 3.0 which basically means
you're<00:01:22.270> gonna<00:01:22.360> get<00:01:22.570> better<00:01:22.719> graphics<00:01:23.259> with

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
you're gonna get better graphics with

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.859 
you're gonna get better graphics with
your<00:01:23.560> device<00:01:23.770> simply<00:01:24.430> put<00:01:24.969> it's<00:01:25.509> basically

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
your device simply put it's basically

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.380 
your device simply put it's basically
the<00:01:26.049> latest<00:01:26.380> version<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.430> industry

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the latest version of the industry

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.760 
the latest version of the industry
industry<00:01:29.079> standard<00:01:29.469> for<00:01:29.500> high-performance

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
industry standard for high-performance

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.300 
industry standard for high-performance
graphics<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:31.479> example<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.229> have<00:01:32.320> asphalt<00:01:32.770> 7<00:01:33.039> on

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
graphics for example I have asphalt 7 on

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.730 
graphics for example I have asphalt 7 on
here<00:01:33.549> which<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.880> somewhat<00:01:34.740> somewhat

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
here which is a somewhat somewhat

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.490 
here which is a somewhat somewhat
graphic<00:01:36.219> intensive<00:01:36.909> game<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.140> guess<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:38.469> I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
graphic intensive game I guess so I

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.569 
graphic intensive game I guess so I
wanted<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.829> just<00:01:38.979> kind<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.159> show<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.490> off

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
wanted to just kind of show that off

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.899 
wanted to just kind of show that off
real<00:01:39.820> quick<00:01:40.119> again<00:01:41.219> developers<00:01:42.219> do<00:01:42.430> need<00:01:42.670> to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
real quick again developers do need to

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.090 
real quick again developers do need to
implement<00:01:43.689> these<00:01:44.020> graphic<00:01:44.469> changes<00:01:44.799> into

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
implement these graphic changes into

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.149 
implement these graphic changes into
their<00:01:45.219> apps<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.850> start<00:01:46.270> utilizing<00:01:46.539> this<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
their apps to start utilizing this this

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.649 
their apps to start utilizing this this
hot<00:01:48.340> these<00:01:48.460> high-performance<00:01:49.119> graphics<00:01:49.179> so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
hot these high-performance graphics so

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.029 
hot these high-performance graphics so
you're<00:01:49.840> gonna<00:01:49.929> have<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.109> wait<00:01:50.229> for<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.560> but<00:01:50.829> I

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
you're gonna have to wait for that but I

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.679 
you're gonna have to wait for that but I
just<00:01:51.399> kind<00:01:51.609> of<00:01:51.640> wanted<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.909> show<00:01:52.090> off<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.390> quick

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
just kind of wanted to show off a quick

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.410 
just kind of wanted to show off a quick
game<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.619> see<00:01:53.859> these<00:01:54.070> graphics<00:01:54.549> alright<00:01:55.270> so

game to see these graphics alright so

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.999 
game to see these graphics alright so
here<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.659> go<00:01:55.719> for<00:01:55.929> example<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:56.590> run<00:01:56.770> through

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
here you go for example just run through

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.609 
here you go for example just run through
this<00:01:57.100> map<00:01:57.429> on<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:58.149> game<00:01:58.530> you'll<00:01:59.530> see

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
this map on this game you'll see

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.789 
this map on this game you'll see
graphics<00:02:00.219> look<00:02:00.369> great<00:02:00.399> they<00:02:00.969> look<00:02:01.030> great<00:02:01.359> on

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
just some graphics there so I wanted to

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.389 
just some graphics there so I wanted to
show<00:02:07.810> off<00:02:07.960> with<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.289> now<00:02:08.950> another<00:02:09.220> new

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
Low Energy which is essentially ways

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.960 
Low Energy which is essentially ways
that<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.280> pair<00:02:39.490> with<00:02:39.520> these<00:02:39.790> new

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
now Bluetooth smart ready it's not

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.010 
now Bluetooth smart ready it's not
necessarily<00:02:45.130> using<00:02:45.370> lower<00:02:45.760> energy<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.780> just

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
necessarily using lower energy it's just

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.840 
necessarily using lower energy it's just
essentially<00:02:47.740> being<00:02:48.130> able<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> pair<00:02:48.670> with

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
essentially being able to pair with

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.450 
essentially being able to pair with
these<00:02:49.090> lower<00:02:49.660> energy<00:02:50.140> devices<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:51.070> then<00:02:51.340> in

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
these lower energy devices and then in

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.640 
these lower energy devices and then in
regards<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.880> Wi-Fi<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
regards to Wi-Fi what you can do is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.050 
regards to Wi-Fi what you can do is
actually<00:02:53.830> go<00:02:54.010> ahead<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.370> into<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.670> Wi-Fi

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
actually go ahead and go into the Wi-Fi

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.360 
actually go ahead and go into the Wi-Fi
settings<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.960> there's<00:02:56.650> actually<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.130> neat

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
settings and there's actually a neat

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.250 
settings and there's actually a neat
option<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:57.880> advanced<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.750> actually<00:02:58.900> kind<00:02:59.230> of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
option in advanced I actually kind of

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.900 
option in advanced I actually kind of
like<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.470> when<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.310> menu<00:03:00.550> go<00:03:00.880> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
like it when you go to menu go to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.120 
like it when you go to menu go to
advanced<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.630> will<00:03:01.660> see<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.560> scanning

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
advanced you will see it is scanning

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.220 
advanced you will see it is scanning
always<00:03:03.790> available<00:03:04.720> let<00:03:04.840> me<00:03:04.900> go<00:03:04.990> ahead<00:03:05.050> and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
always available let me go ahead and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.510 
always available let me go ahead and
zoom<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:05.980> can<00:03:06.040> read<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
zoom in on that so you can read what it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.700 
zoom in on that so you can read what it
says<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.420> says<00:03:07.570> let<00:03:07.810> Google<00:03:08.230> location

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
says so it says let Google location

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.290 
says so it says let Google location
service<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.280> other<00:03:09.400> apps<00:03:09.640> scan<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.210> networks

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
service and other apps scan for networks

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.960 
service and other apps scan for networks
even<00:03:10.750> when<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.990> Wi-Fi<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.470> off<00:03:11.970> essentially

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
even when the Wi-Fi is off essentially

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.250 
even when the Wi-Fi is off essentially
what<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.120> means<00:03:13.270> is<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.600> do<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:13.960> have<00:03:14.170> to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
what that means is you do not have to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.030 
what that means is you do not have to
have<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:17.320> GPS<00:03:17.740> or

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
have the Wi-Fi on to use for GPS or

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520 
have the Wi-Fi on to use for GPS or
location<00:03:18.610> services<00:03:19.210> because<00:03:20.080> having<00:03:20.410> your

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
location services because having your

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.500 
location services because having your
Wi-Fi<00:03:21.010> on<00:03:21.040> definitely<00:03:21.940> improves<00:03:22.330> your

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
Wi-Fi on definitely improves your

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.570 
Wi-Fi on definitely improves your
location<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.320> makes<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> easier<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.520> a

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
location and makes it easier to get a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.600 
location and makes it easier to get a
GPS<00:03:25.060> lock<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.440> check<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:26.860> then<00:03:27.490> it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
GPS lock so you can check that then it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.580 
GPS lock so you can check that then it
will<00:03:27.670> turn<00:03:27.970> Wi-Fi<00:03:28.210> on<00:03:28.480> when<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.930> needs<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.230> find

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
will turn Wi-Fi on when it needs to find

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.580 
will turn Wi-Fi on when it needs to find
a<00:03:29.890> GPS<00:03:30.430> lock<00:03:30.760> or<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> location<00:03:31.600> they've<00:03:32.440> also

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
a GPS lock or a location they've also

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.890 
a GPS lock or a location they've also
added<00:03:32.890> additional<00:03:33.580> language<00:03:34.090> support<00:03:34.570> so

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
and start typing a number we can go out

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.760 
and start typing a number we can go out
and<00:04:03.580> type<00:04:03.760> one<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.360> will<00:04:04.510> see<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.080> brings<00:04:05.440> up<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
and type one you will see it brings up a

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.770 
and type one you will see it brings up a
list<00:04:06.070> of<00:04:06.310> names<00:04:06.370> right<00:04:07.030> there<00:04:07.210> and<00:04:07.390> numbers

list of names right there and numbers

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.750 
list of names right there and numbers
obviously<00:04:07.990> I'm<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.530> blur<00:04:08.680> them<00:04:08.920> out<00:04:09.070> but

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
obviously I'm going to blur them out but

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.980 
obviously I'm going to blur them out but
if<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.000> see<00:04:10.330> one<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.600> want<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.870> call

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
if you see one that you want to call

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.480 
if you see one that you want to call
just<00:04:11.050> go<00:04:11.350> ahead<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.590> tap<00:04:11.740> on<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.310> will

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
just go ahead and tap on it and it will

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.730 
just go ahead and tap on it and it will
instantly<00:04:13.060> call<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.930> number<00:04:14.410> just<00:04:14.650> like

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
instantly call that number just like

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.729 
instantly call that number just like
that<00:04:15.040> so<00:04:15.370> you'll<00:04:15.940> see<00:04:16.270> it's<00:04:16.930> very<00:04:17.140> convenient

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
that so you'll see it's very convenient

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.260 
that so you'll see it's very convenient
especially<00:04:17.920> because<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.880> don't<00:04:19.060> have<00:04:19.150> to

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
especially because you don't have to

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.450 
especially because you don't have to
really<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.470> can<00:04:20.590> type<00:04:20.770> in<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.919> name<00:04:21.010> as

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
really you can type in the name as

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.590 
really you can type in the name as
opposed<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.090> number<00:04:22.210> instead<00:04:22.540> of

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
opposed to the number instead of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.330 
opposed to the number instead of
scrolling<00:04:22.930> through<00:04:23.260> all<00:04:23.410> your<00:04:23.620> contacts<00:04:24.100> so

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
scrolling through all your contacts so

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.249 
scrolling through all your contacts so
makes<00:04:24.760> them<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.940> little<00:04:25.150> easier<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:25.479> find

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
makes them a little easier to find

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.409 
makes them a little easier to find
and<00:04:26.380> then<00:04:26.770> finally<00:04:27.520> there's<00:04:27.729> some<00:04:27.970> virtual

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
and then finally there's some virtual

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.050 
and then finally there's some virtual
surround<00:04:28.720> sound<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.530> has<00:04:29.650> been<00:04:30.069> implemented

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
surround sound that has been implemented

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.600 
surround sound that has been implemented
it<00:04:31.569> actually<00:04:31.900> works<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.350> Nexus<00:04:32.770> 7<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.160> the
