 great advantage rhart interfaces 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.099
 dissimilarity it is already scored 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.449
 go parallel to the polar principle 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.999
 placement icon applications entered 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.449
 in fashion and melted 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.719
 and happily borrowed 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.819
 Android developers 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.939
 clicking on the configure button we can 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.649
 change the location of icons and 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:07.649
 desktop widgets or delete 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.509
 deleting the icon deletes and 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.610
 applications and you can even delete 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.009
 pre-installed applications 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.460
 we can have icons and widgets on 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.589
 desktop groups according to 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:20.730
 application type 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.240
 or regular use of them 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.710
 and let it look like pampering 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.910
 but actually any user can 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.550
 choose the best 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.160
 placement of objects that will be convenient 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.119

 convenience of working with applications 

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:37.259
 unconditional plus turn compared to 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.929
 other tablets operating 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:40.219

 in general, the interface Vitas is amazing 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.869
 forethought and courage 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.289
 if the interface I was afraid calculated 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:58.539
 to use one hardware 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.599

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.199
 you can put on the tablet 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.300
 another operating system for example
