as well as they got the bug so is quite

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.660 
as well as they got the bug so is quite
hard<00:02:37.340> as<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:38.480> removes<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.560> logos<00:02:39.980> or<00:02:40.220> stickers

as<00:02:40.850> soon<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.270> die<00:02:41.420> or<00:02:41.840> something<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.800> a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
as soon as you die or something like a

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.770 
as soon as you die or something like a
string<00:02:43.190> happens<00:02:43.580> if<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.910> did<00:02:44.120> find<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.450> way<00:02:44.480> we

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
string happens if I did find a way we

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.900 
string happens if I did find a way we
could<00:02:44.989> go<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> apartment<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.610> I'm<00:02:46.700> actually

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
could go to apartment and I'm actually

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.770 
could go to apartment and I'm actually
safe<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.520> removes<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.600> think

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
safe it that it removes it so I think

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
safe it that it removes it so I think
there<00:02:51.320> may<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.620> enough<00:02:52.100> winks<00:02:52.459> as<00:02:52.610> much<00:02:52.790> as

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
there may be enough winks as much as

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.180 
there may be enough winks as much as
possibly<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:53.570> everything<00:02:54.140> as<00:02:54.620> well<00:02:54.920> as<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190

possibly for everything as well as the
cob<00:02:55.400> one<00:02:55.610> which<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.360> should<00:02:56.570> be<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:57.020> soon

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
cob one which there should be out soon

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.340
