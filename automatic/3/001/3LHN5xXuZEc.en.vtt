00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
could go here and say is and i can push

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
could go here and say is and i can push
the<00:01:27.450> right<00:01:27.600> arrow<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.799> move<00:01:31.920> around

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the right arrow so you can move around

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.350 
the right arrow so you can move around
with<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> left<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.060> arrow<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:35.360> by

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
with the left and right arrow or by

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
with the left and right arrow or by
using<00:01:36.570> move<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.460> use<00:01:38.729> two

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
using move or you can actually use two

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
using move or you can actually use two
fingers<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.750> drag<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:40.320> by

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
fingers and just drag it around by

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
fingers and just drag it around by
having<00:01:41.009> two<00:01:41.189> fingers<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:43.110> it's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
having two fingers but actually it's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
having two fingers but actually it's
kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> tedious<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.790> move<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
kind of tedious to move like that so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.649 
kind of tedious to move like that so
note<00:01:46.320> taker<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> even<00:01:47.070> easier<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
note taker makes it even easier if you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.880 
note taker makes it even easier if you
get<00:01:48.869> towards<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.710> how<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
get towards the right you see how this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
get towards the right you see how this
gray<00:01:53.250> area<00:01:53.280> appears<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.180> called<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> auto

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
gray area appears that's called the auto

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.560 
gray area appears that's called the auto
advance<00:01:55.140> area<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.399> write<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
advance area if you write on it it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
advance area if you write on it it
automatically<00:01:58.170> advances<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.950> put<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.310> ink

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
automatically advances and put your ink

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.929 
automatically advances and put your ink
over<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> moves<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.049> blue<00:02:01.439> area<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
over it moves that blue area so if I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
over it moves that blue area so if I
write<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.939> now<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
write for all and now if I see that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.979 
write for all and now if I see that
little<00:02:07.610> purple<00:02:08.610> line<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.149> corresponds<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
little purple line that corresponds to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.320 
little purple line that corresponds to
the<00:02:10.080> end<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.860> i<00:02:10.890> wrote<00:02:11.099> over<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.300> i

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the end of what i wrote over here so i

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
the end of what i wrote over here so i
can<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:12.810> two

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
can put two

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:23.420 
can put two
l<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.590> right<00:02:13.770> next<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:22.250> see<00:02:23.250> I'm<00:02:23.400> just

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
l is right next to it so see I'm just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.730 
l is right next to it so see I'm just
writing<00:02:24.180> over<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> over<00:02:25.050> again<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
writing over and over again and as I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.260 
writing over and over again and as I
write<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:30.300> moves<00:02:30.660> over<00:02:32.270> automatically

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
write it just moves over automatically

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.360 
write it just moves over automatically
now<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.320> bottom<00:02:34.530> over<00:02:34.950> here<00:02:35.190> how

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
now you see at the bottom over here how

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.610 
now you see at the bottom over here how
it's<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:35.820> turned<00:02:36.210> from<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.660> gray<00:02:36.960> dotted<00:02:37.410> line

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
it's now turned from a gray dotted line

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's now turned from a gray dotted line
into<00:02:38.370> an<00:02:38.490> orange<00:02:38.790> asst<00:02:39.120> dotted<00:02:39.480> line<00:02:39.660> that's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
into an orange asst dotted line that's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.330 
into an orange asst dotted line that's
to<00:02:40.110> let<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.560> you're<00:02:40.860> getting<00:02:40.980> near

to let you know that you're getting near

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.340 
to let you know that you're getting near
the<00:02:41.490> right-hand<00:02:41.910> side<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.200> get

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the right-hand side because when you get

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.010 
the right-hand side because when you get
all<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.710> way<00:02:43.800> over<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:45.360> gives

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
all the way over to the right it gives

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.470 
all the way over to the right it gives
you<00:02:46.320> an<00:02:47.220> indication<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.940> you're<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.300> end

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you an indication that you're at the end

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.940 
you an indication that you're at the end
and<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.810> actually<00:02:48.930> touch<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and if you actually touch that it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
and if you actually touch that it
automatically<00:02:50.490> gives<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> return<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.900> can

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
automatically gives you a return you can

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.710 
automatically gives you a return you can
give<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.710> return<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> next<00:02:54.330> line<00:02:54.480> by

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
give a return going to the next line by

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.290 
give a return going to the next line by
pushing<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.230> button<00:02:55.820> it's<00:02:56.820> actually<00:02:57.180> pretty

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
pushing this button it's actually pretty

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.640 
pushing this button it's actually pretty
smart<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:58.170> only<00:02:58.410> does<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.740> do<00:03:02.210> like<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.650> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
smart not only does it do like that it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.820 
smart not only does it do like that it
but<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.430> write<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.870> sort<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.230> figures<00:03:10.560> out

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
but if I write it sort of figures out

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.700 
but if I write it sort of figures out
sometimes<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.850> want<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.710> that

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
sometimes that you want to do that

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.830 
sometimes that you want to do that
you're<00:03:13.860> doing<00:03:13.980> cursive<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.690> your

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
you're doing cursive and that your

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020 
you're doing cursive and that your
dotting<00:03:16.350> i's<00:03:16.590> crossing<00:03:17.190> T's<00:03:17.400> something<00:03:17.850> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
dotting i's crossing T's something like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:32.930 
dotting i's crossing T's something like
that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.270 

now<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.600> we've<00:03:34.720> gone<00:03:34.930> over<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.590> ability<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> be

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
now so we've gone over the ability to be

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.580 
now so we've gone over the ability to be
able<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.640> move<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.000> around<00:03:37.210> to<00:03:37.660> be<00:03:38.320> able<00:03:38.500> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
able to move this around to be able to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.140 
able to move this around to be able to
get<00:03:38.710> wherever<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.100> want<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.610> let's<00:03:39.790> say<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.060> I

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
get wherever you want so let's say if I

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.660 
get wherever you want so let's say if I
wanted<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.450> be<00:03:40.660> able<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.170> check<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:42.220> something

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
wanted to be able to check off something

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.190 
wanted to be able to check off something
in<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.790> list<00:03:43.030> i<00:03:43.150> could<00:03:43.330> just<00:03:43.450> move<00:03:43.630> over<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.050> do

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
in a list i could just move over to do

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.470 
in a list i could just move over to do
that<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:45.250> let's<00:03:45.520> say<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.670> made<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> mistake<00:03:46.030> I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
that but let's say I made a mistake I

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.770 
that but let's say I made a mistake I
can<00:03:46.660> hit<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.920> erase<00:03:48.190> button<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.880> now<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:49.720> a

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
can hit the erase button and now it's a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
can hit the erase button and now it's a
racing<00:03:49.990> black<00:03:50.500> ink<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:50.980> whatever<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.670> over

racing black ink and whatever I go over

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.920 
racing black ink and whatever I go over
with<00:03:52.060> my<00:03:52.210> finger<00:03:52.740> erases<00:03:53.740> I<00:03:54.480> could<00:03:55.480> also<00:03:55.600> push

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
with my finger erases I could also push

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.870 
with my finger erases I could also push
the<00:03:56.110> undo<00:03:56.500> button<00:03:56.530> over<00:03:57.100> here<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.550> undo

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
the undo button over here and undo

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.550 
the undo button over here and undo
erases<00:03:58.540> or<00:03:58.720> writing<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:01.140> there's<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.200> redo

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
erases or writing and there's a redo

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.920 
erases or writing and there's a redo
button<00:04:02.860> so<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.160> can<00:04:03.490> redo<00:04:04.390> things<00:04:04.630> that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
button so you can redo things that

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.090 
button so you can redo things that
you've<00:04:05.110> written<00:04:05.350> that<00:04:05.710> you've<00:04:05.890> done<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:08.100> race

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
you've written that you've done a race

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.580 
you've written that you've done a race

can also erase red ink so you have a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.400 
can also erase red ink so you have a
finer<00:04:15.120> ability<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.299> erase<00:04:16.420> if<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:16.989> want<00:04:17.230> to

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.160 
finer ability to erase if you want to
you<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.160> switch<00:04:18.489> between<00:04:18.730> them<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.690> also<00:04:19.870> can

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
you can switch between them you also can

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.260 
you can switch between them you also can
erase<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.590> whole<00:04:20.709> thing<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.820> by<00:04:22.030> pushing

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
that button another button we have is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.740 
that button another button we have is
the<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.910> pencil<00:04:31.900> over<00:04:32.200> here<00:04:33.420> known<00:04:34.420> as<00:04:34.480> this

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
the the pencil over here known as this

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.340 
the the pencil over here known as this
is<00:04:34.930> small<00:04:36.780> alright<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:37.870> I'm<00:04:37.930> trying<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.230> write

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
is small alright so I'm trying to write

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.270 
is small alright so I'm trying to write
pretty<00:04:38.650> big<00:04:38.950> but<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.910> comes<00:04:40.120> up<00:04:40.270> really<00:04:40.450> small

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
pretty big but it comes up really small

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.480 
pretty big but it comes up really small
if<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.430> tap<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.090> pencil<00:04:43.480> once<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.800> detail<00:04:45.190> area

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
if I tap the pencil once the detail area

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.320 
if I tap the pencil once the detail area
gets<00:04:45.669> bigger

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.820 

that's<00:04:52.479> bigger<00:04:54.090> let's<00:04:55.090> go<00:04:55.210> over<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.509> bit<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.020> tap

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
that's bigger let's go over a bit I tap

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.279 
that's bigger let's go over a bit I tap
it<00:04:57.009> again<00:04:57.689> now<00:04:58.689> its<00:05:03.389> biggest<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.110> draw

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
it again now its biggest you can draw

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.409 
it again now its biggest you can draw
nice<00:05:06.030> boxes<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.210> stuff<00:05:07.389> like<00:05:07.629> that<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:10.330> you

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
nice boxes and stuff like that so you

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.990 
nice boxes and stuff like that so you
can<00:05:10.780> switch<00:05:11.319> between<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:12.069> if<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.639> find<00:05:12.909> that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
can switch between that if you find that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.029 
can switch between that if you find that
you<00:05:13.210> naturally<00:05:13.569> right<00:05:14.080> really<00:05:14.349> small<00:05:14.889> so<00:05:17.039> that

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
you naturally right really small so that

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.450 
you naturally right really small so that
really<00:05:18.250> doesn't<00:05:18.490> work<00:05:18.759> for<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.150> then<00:05:19.439> you<00:05:20.460> can

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
still write small but it will look

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.350
