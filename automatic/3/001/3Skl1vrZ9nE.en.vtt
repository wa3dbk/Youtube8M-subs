00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 when i looked up from our games i saw 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.950
 that dad that she looked from behind the window 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 since the store was seized 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.220
 he stayed home during the day was just like 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.369
 the paper was not he was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 as I have been vacationing him lately 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.430
 his hands in his pockets are face 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 are so sad shoulders around 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 small 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.930
 he looked at us maybe he will 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.610
 us are about where the web 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.110
 above the fear around them 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.350
 under that he was torn inside 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.540
 by the decisions you have to make 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.830
 they can't all be that bad 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 it wasn't that we were so little 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.660
 still to come 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.080
 he was a store maybe yes that was 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.610
 very marty favorites 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.800
 they could do something that fits us or not 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.960
 just take it away 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.550
 would of course pass if we had 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.200
 actually pretty little bothered by the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.520
 Germans do not like in the largest position 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 until 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.670
 Daddy 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.140
 sometimes you have those stories that are whole 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 hard line coming in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.460
 and this was the story despite it 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.310
 me or who you told 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 I didn't know everything afterwards 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.420
 that I 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.870
 oh sir 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.610
 is on 1 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.690
 here it would be about the writer wife 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.500
 because it's so cold 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.230
 very nice to to tell 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.380
 when we went looking it all the way 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.670
 happens really three years with is one 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.630
 powersearch 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.640
 people approached 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.880
 I also made that up a lot 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.280
 have really become a brother countries 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.280
 yes i always wording it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.269
 I put up a fictional story 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.489
 windows learn from facts but somewhere the 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.110
 main line most of the dikes 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:19.200
 route certainly when it comes to the tot 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 that make family and agreements 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000
 in parsonage and all worries 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.030
 around hiding 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.970
 that's correct 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.519
 only when the Second World War begins 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.959
 have the jewish hartog and jacoba francs 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.540
 still have no idea what they think 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.080
 waiting stands living in the quiet 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.730
 lienden 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.349
 with commit tours elizabeth and tours 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.769
 rally, however, it soon becomes clear 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.290
 that the family must go into hiding in 1942 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.269
 leave father mother and elizabeth and 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.260
 their first hiding place 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.090
 elly is with the nanny 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.100
 left in the hope that nobody 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.470
 attention than her will give was the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.030
 is only four years old, unfortunately 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.859
 this is not the case 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 Mayor Kamp van Lienden dares 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.609
 not to keep his mouth shut about it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.609
 Jewish girl and light stu 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 yes I am very briefly if necessary 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.489
 I 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.439
 [Music] 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.560
 and moment interviewing and trying 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.090
 history as accurately as possible honor 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.980
 to give 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.980
 therefore a very little emotion 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.020
 I like to slide a little bit out 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.510
 myself 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.850
 intentionally refurbished buyer piece 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.300
 personal appearance because the player 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.970
 shoulder and still lives and each 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.150
 housekeeper turned out I still love 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.830
 write 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.490
 she now 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.069
 just change as the ages after the 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.230
 place are the products 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.490
 and yes if you do that you also have more 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.569
 space 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.219
 [Music] 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:02.830
 when i started writing i want to be there 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:06.250
 also an interesting farewell but busy 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.200
 more answers and more to get involved 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.100
 I got this for me 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.890
 opportunity to give an account of her voice 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.720
 a child from thousands of something for me 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.959
 nine had had for me without it 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.959
 become 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.680
 and then it really starts 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.600
 beating almost becomes them 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.940
 and it still feels that way 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.160
 I think every reading I give 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 I tell her that can also clear 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.820
 everywhere I go often invited 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.280
 is becoming 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.960
 tell and stand

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.310
 be forgotten 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.249
 on the other hand also something 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.229

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.789
 shock that elly was taken by order 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.219
 from the mayor for them came the 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.469

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.439

 ears gyaru he also points his museums and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.620
 then you had to place it 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:31.350
 for example for you 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.510
