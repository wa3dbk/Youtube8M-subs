what's coming I mean at the end of the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
what's coming I mean at the end of the
day<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.000> reason<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.389> we're<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> tunnel

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
day the reason that we're in the tunnel

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.510 
day the reason that we're in the tunnel
is<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> make<00:00:16.500> sure<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.949> whatever<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
is to make sure that whatever the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.950 
is to make sure that whatever the
experience<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> safe<00:00:18.779> one

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
experience it's going to be a safe one

the<00:00:19.320> class<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.010> put<00:00:20.160> people<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.520> ease

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the class is just to put people at ease

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.710 
the class is just to put people at ease
and<00:00:20.850> give<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.210> idea<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> what

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and give them an idea of what

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
and give them an idea of what
mechanically<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.380> happening<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.340> they

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
mechanically is happening so that they

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
mechanically is happening so that they
have<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> experience<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.660> pay<00:00:24.840> for

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
have a experience that they pay for

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.990 
have a experience that they pay for
right<00:00:25.500> which<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.859> definitely<00:00:26.070> appreciate<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
right which I definitely appreciate it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
right which I definitely appreciate it
because<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.529> unnerving

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
because I think it's a little unnerving

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
because I think it's a little unnerving
when<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:29.760> look<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> wind<00:00:30.510> tunnel

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
when you first look at the wind tunnel

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.910 
when you first look at the wind tunnel
like<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.140> looking<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.740> what's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
like what are we looking at here what's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.639 
like what are we looking at here what's
underneath<00:00:32.279> us<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
underneath us well down here this is

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.950 
underneath us well down here this is
basically<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.130> big<00:00:35.190> open<00:00:35.670> basement<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.780> all

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
basically a big open basement where all

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
basically a big open basement where all
the<00:00:37.110> air<00:00:37.230> gets<00:00:37.469> trapped<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the air gets trapped and then there's a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
the air gets trapped and then there's a
foam<00:00:38.640> above<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.239> basement<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> pushes

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
foam above the basement and it pushes

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.389 
foam above the basement and it pushes
the<00:00:40.260> air<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.010> riding<00:00:41.309> on

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the air and that's what we're riding on

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
the air and that's what we're riding on
this<00:00:41.550> whole<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> basically<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
this whole thing is basically a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.150 
this whole thing is basically a
multi-million<00:00:43.410> dollar<00:00:43.440> air<00:00:43.770> compressor

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
multi-million dollar air compressor

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
multi-million dollar air compressor
that's<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> works<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.870> write<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that's how it works and we write on the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.090 
that's how it works and we write on the
tube<00:00:46.700> okay<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> what's<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.840> top<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.800> top

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
tube okay and what's up top here up top

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
tube okay and what's up top here up top
the<00:00:50.879> V<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> turned<00:00:52.020> around

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the V is where they are is turned around

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
the V is where they are is turned around
so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> makes<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> big<00:00:52.980> circle<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so that makes a big circle this is a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
so that makes a big circle this is a
closed<00:00:54.090> system<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.960> heat<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> up

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
closed system so we can heat it up

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
closed system so we can heat it up
during<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> winter<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.760> Quebec<00:00:57.090> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
during the winter because in Quebec you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
during the winter because in Quebec you
need<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> able<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.350> cold<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
need to be able to do that it's cold the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
need to be able to do that it's cold the
other<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.280> does<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> white<00:01:00.000> part

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
other thing this does is the white part

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
other thing this does is the white part
opens<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.809> very<00:01:01.020> slowly<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.770> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
opens up very slowly so if we have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
opens up very slowly so if we have
somebody<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> floats<00:01:02.670> by<00:01:02.879> accident<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
somebody that floats by accident it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
somebody that floats by accident it
leads<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> air<00:01:04.530> pressure<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> after

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
leads off the air pressure and after

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
leads off the air pressure and after
about<00:01:05.519> 10<00:01:05.760> feet<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.510> stop<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.170> we

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
about 10 feet they stop that way we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.600 
about 10 feet they stop that way we
don't<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.650> somebody<00:01:07.860> walk<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
don't have somebody walk in for the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
don't have somebody walk in for the
first<00:01:08.760> 30<00:01:09.000> seconds<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.630> stuck<00:01:09.930> 45<00:01:10.409> feet

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
first 30 seconds and get stuck 45 feet

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.719 
first 30 seconds and get stuck 45 feet
up<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.920> air<00:01:13.100> you're<00:01:14.100> gonna<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.400> doing

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
up in the air you're gonna be doing

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
up in the air you're gonna be doing
