00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.799
 well it is often said that our face 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.020
 It is the mirror of what we feel in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.519
 Everywhere every Monday we really learn 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.830
 that to communicate we only need 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 the words can say a lot with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 just a gesture today we want 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 focus on our face and specifically on 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 the look for it we have our 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 expert in non-verbal communication 3 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 Álvaro who comes to show us that the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 way we look can also be 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.150
 an authority and control tool 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.070
 good afternoon teresa good afternoon 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 we always make a lot of reference to the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.050
 importance of what a look 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.790
 the eyes also say a lot even 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 we can even give orders with the eyes 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 power relations shows that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 there are between two people between or between a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.379
 and your audience for example among many 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 people see if we are talking 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 of yours 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 and someone watching us could figure out what 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 relationship we have at that moment who is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.600
 the dominant who is more submissive or by 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 example in a professional environment 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 we could know who has more rank in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.500
 the hierarchy why why the forms 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.610
 of looking are different according to the power or 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.740
 also according to the intentions according to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.500
 active or we can say everything with the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.500
 look man everything not everything but almost 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.150
 everything almost everything and we can influence a lot 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.310
 in others that's why it's important 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.320
 know this language 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.979
 the people who are dominant that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.750
 They also want to demonstrate this power 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.720
 they have basically two ways of acting 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.330
 one of them is not looking too much at 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.990
 people around you for example a 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.510
 boss does not look much at his subordinates 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.700
 look - the boss to his subordinates who 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.640
 vice versa because because he 's saying 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.570
 that he decides when he addresses them 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 when looking at them it establishes a way of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.520
 contact and open a communication channel 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.440
 If you do not look at them, it's that at that moment 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
 he is interested in talking with them 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.320
 instead the subordinate looks more to his 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.530
 boss and another way to demonstrate power is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.350
 looking when you are interested in 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.140
 someone to tell you and I have 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.019
 influence on you and in addition even you 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.240
 can give orders with the look only that 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.240
 we can say with the look 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 look you know that in killer tiers 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.420
 total that you can strike with the look 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.610
 that you can even indicate that someone 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 look to the side 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.590
 for example to call a waiter 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 apart from making many gestures with the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 hands too but the right thing and also 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.150
 according to the protocol it would only direct the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.130
 look towards the waiter and he would give 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.740
 realize that we establish this contact 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.300
 visual for him to come to our table 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.300
 we counted a little bit like the six 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 recommendations we could give to those 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 people who run a meeting or who 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.950
 they are controlling a whole class uy 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
 this the teachers know 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.840
 they perfectly know that they can be 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.600
 explaining math geography language 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.710
 and at the same time control these 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.890
 students 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.160
 based on the looks therefore we are going 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.390
 to see what is most effective in these 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.340
 deadlines yes always look towards the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.420
 people towards the eyes but above all 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 look 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.400
 to the individuals in the group that 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.200
 conflicting seem the already conflictive 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.510
 we know them the teachers already know 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.220
 who are where they are placed but 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.340
 you can also find yourself with a 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.040
 public you do not know and well then 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.220
 you see that a group is distracting I know that 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 is speaking with the look your you 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.170
 you fix the look that people 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.000
 you keep talking about your topic but you're 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.000
 people will realize the pressure 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.130
 which exercises is through the gaze or 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.420
 it also serves to tell presumed 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.870
 conflicting individuals in a meeting 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.620
 in advance warn them that they are not going to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.019
 power is to say I start a talk and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.140
 I know some people in the audience 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.590
 they have come to chew me for 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.720
 sabotaging my presentation because I already them 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.510
 I look directly without saying anything 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.560
 obviously of this relationship but of the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.320
 topic that I am trying 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090
 and I'm warning you that I 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.360
 I feel strong that they will not be able to 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.970
 with me and that kind of looks has to 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.710
 to be accompanied let's say it like that with me 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.630
 they allow the expression that bad face 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:39.650
 milk 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:43.210
 man this is a face is saying what 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.210
 nice you are and instead when 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.130
 Well, it can not necessarily be a 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.070
 look of authority and power but 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.960
 nice with a smile what happens is 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.470
 that if we want to intimidate if we want 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.870
 give an order and say care then 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.150
 if we get serious and also about 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.090
 all pucker his eyebrows when 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.280
 eyebrows are down the look is more 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.320
 powerful and there are differences between 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.840
 men and women we look different and if 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.240
 we look differently but now in 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.240
 relationship with power we know that the 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.129
 women look more but move more 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.159
 quickly look 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.610
 and that is in relation to the paper 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.559
 secondary secondary of his vision that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.789
 historically the woman has had 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.279
 with respect to man there would also be 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.589
 difference by ages I guess so for 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:37.129
 ages there is also look children do not 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:39.649
 they still know the social guidelines of 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.449
 behavior of the look and they can look at 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.339
 Someone definitely do not have any 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.649
 curse no malice and besides you 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.269
 they are watching you are doing a 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.789
 scanner are looking at you are 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:53.240
 observing little angels well after clear 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.429
 they are learning that this can not be 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.949
 socially is not accepted and 

00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:00.169
 adolescents on the contrary divert very 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.330
 easily look at the video and I for 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.279
 end 3a some general advice that 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.219
 We can give our friends to win 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:10.009
 in authority and control well then yes 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:12.559
 we want to show firm signs and 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.969
 people with authority always in this 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.429
 good sense 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.489
 let's look straight into the eyes on 

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:21.919
 all this area here go up in the eyes 

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:24.529
 do not deviate to any other part 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.870
 of the face maintain eye contact 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.200
 without 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.900
 and above all to make the other divert the 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.720
 look before us alone that's a 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.670
 great challenge to see who has to rihanna the 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.990
 look before teresa baron very many 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.790
 Thank you as always hope 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.410
 next week with more tips on the 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.740
 verbal communication until next time 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.740
 week
