 was seven or eight years old butcher and that's it 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.119
 hindered a little culture and under

 and at the same time to protect themselves from 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 the advancing sea is not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 of today that the sea to see it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 enter the lands a southerly wind gets 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 did not wish to confirm the

 valves to prevent the invasion of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 vaccarès by the mediterranean so monday 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.510
 to the mother the ground 90% of the flow to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 salin-de-giraud the little rhône 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.539
 flows to the holy marries of the sea and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.609
 inside he wanted to create the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
 French granary but they have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 grown as dry cultures 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.500
 after 30 years the Camargue 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.500
 stéphane salt marsh 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.640
 with us and tom near marseille 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.170
 galéjade a little but here it is true we have 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.270
 twice as much evaporation as 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.520
 hurry and what will we do 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560
 evaporate this water c the hot weather 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.430
 from may june july august september and on 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.860
 has two women 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.300
 the mistral who is a man is and the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 Tramontana due north is the wind 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.710
 dry it can the humility of amo ce 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.960
 do it can soil moisture and 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.910
 kahina then came the basement and in the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.070
 under ground by capillarity we meet 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.050
 saline water since the can was taken 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.180
 on the sea and as it does not rain 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.830
 salt water this salt it remains a place 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.750
 the most terrible for the culture for the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.760
 form for the job ie flush 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.860
 of earth and in 1900 there was more 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 no culture possible everyone 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.550
 went to the coasts of the Rhône and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.530
 some brave ones who stayed a 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.810
 comrade they told each other we played 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.580
 sorcerer apprentices canton and his two 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.729
 domestic delta n is still there 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.729
 problems 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 the only cereal that remakes a little 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.770
 the equivalent of the saddlery nature because 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.930
 that the rice resist a little salt and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.590
 same time it brings a lot of water 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 fresh 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.620
 so this sweet water is going to wash the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.940
 earth that washes the salt that makes the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.850
 camargue and he understood that 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.120
 make three amri third wheat 3 ha 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 alfalfa 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.680
 at the beginning of the century 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.450
 we had tried this rice but we have 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 practice is bad it's not easy to 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.780
 to make rice you have to know their peak and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.520
 you need to know the summit on which date 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.580
 12 years old and we did not know how to do it 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.640
 the rice of the 1920s was summoned to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.380
 1940s just to bring some 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.030
 water in paddy fields and laughs 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.960
 left for cattle feeding 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 until the 40s and the first ones who 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.680
 have put our foot in the stirrup 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.960
 it's the Indochinese the key gran 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.150
 contingent he was next to us 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.400
 in sorgues 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.190
 the mayor of arles paid tribute to 11.2 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.510
 former Vietnamese workers 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.950
 highlighting the contribution of the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.170
 immigrants in the history of the territory 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.180
 camargue and the canal territory does 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.370
 would not be what it is without them 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.420
 Indochinese who brought their 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.300
 technicality and the particularity of their 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.690
 experience and their hymn we are not without 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.170
 doubt could be continued being cultured 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 throughout the years that followed and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.640
 become today one of the riches the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 cama Indochinese tests we had the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.730
 people the best to make rice on 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.740
 the planet 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.500
 at this time we have transplanted the rice 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:51.350
 we cultivated it well and the rib was 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.450
 one of the best in the world there has been the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.160
 marshall plan there have been the aids and at this 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.130
 moment there the camarguais in the years 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.380
 40 3 he started making rice but 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.600
 evolution the value of rice she is 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.520
 huge because in the 50s we 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.140
 called it their white because the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.090
 Camargue lands and in the hall and not 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.100
 was not worth much flowery had a 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.540
 huge value a kilo of rice sa 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.390
 was equivalent to buying a bag of cement 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.489
 50 kg and many rice farmers have 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.430
 makes a fortune because a rice harvest 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.169
 it was equivalent to the purchase of the property 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.300
 varieties of rice that came out in 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.820
 camalcé as well the red rice colors 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.520
 black what and that's complete rice to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.300
 madagascar he uses this red rice when 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.220
 They are sick 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.480
 pregnant women as well as 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.460
 aging people 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.990
 they take it will be red or mouse 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.250
 black because it's a fabulous he 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.810
 then mineral salts 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.850
 trace elements send it the germ of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:50.100
 antioxidants and rice this is a 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:52.170
 medicine for 5000 years the rice it is 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.670
 so to speak always by marking his 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.060
 he has his feet in the water he created from 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.060
 Sun
