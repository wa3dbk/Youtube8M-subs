in<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> code<00:00:45.989> situation<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.100> build<00:00:47.219> any

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
in a code situation so you can build any

in a code situation so you can build any
type<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> scenario<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.719> make<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
type of scenario you can make it go in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.500 
type of scenario you can make it go in
any<00:00:49.410> direction<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.030> changing

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
any direction and they can be changing

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750 
any direction and they can be changing
the<00:00:51.600> vital<00:00:51.870> signs<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.800> provide<00:00:53.160> care<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the vital signs as you provide care and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
the vital signs as you provide care and
we<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.050> positive<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we can have it go positive way that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
we can have it go positive way that
they're<00:00:56.129> improving<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.789> maybe<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> child<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
they're improving or maybe the child is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
they're improving or maybe the child is
declining<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:59.010> need<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
declining a little bit and they need to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
declining a little bit and they need to
think<00:00:59.489> about<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.760> new<00:01:00.000> pathway<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
think about a new pathway to be going I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.369 
think about a new pathway to be going I
was<00:01:01.230> able<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.680> manipulate<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> settings<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
was able to manipulate the settings so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
was able to manipulate the settings so
that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> child<00:01:04.890> had<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> lower<00:01:05.430> blood

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that the child had a lower blood

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.929 
that the child had a lower blood
pressure<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.170> very<00:01:07.350> high<00:01:07.409> heart<00:01:07.799> rate

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
pressure at a very high heart rate

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
pressure at a very high heart rate
wasn't<00:01:08.939> breathing<00:01:09.119> very<00:01:09.450> well<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
wasn't breathing very well all the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
wasn't breathing very well all the
things<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.220> normal<00:01:11.340> baby<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.180> do

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
things that a normal baby you would do

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.050 
things that a normal baby you would do
and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.860> required<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.159> team<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> intervene

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and then required the team to intervene

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
and then required the team to intervene
and<00:01:15.450> they're<00:01:15.659> fascinated<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.409> how<00:01:16.560> lifelike

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and they're fascinated at how lifelike

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
and they're fascinated at how lifelike
the<00:01:17.310> simulation<00:01:17.880> baby<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.140> could

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the simulation baby is that they could

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.050 
the simulation baby is that they could
see<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.130> seizures<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.970> they

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
see that they have seizures or they

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.420 
see that they have seizures or they
could<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.360> their<00:01:21.509> respiratory<00:01:21.780> status

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
could see their respiratory status

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.770 
could see their respiratory status
changing<00:01:23.430> improving<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.150> their<00:01:24.299> pupil<00:01:24.600> size

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
changing improving that their pupil size

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
changing improving that their pupil size
changes<00:01:25.380> its<00:01:25.770> lifelike<00:01:26.280> enough<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.970> people

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
changes its lifelike enough that people

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
changes its lifelike enough that people
can<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> scenario<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> actually

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
can get into the scenario and actually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
can get into the scenario and actually
feel<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.900> check<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.619> pulses<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
feel like they can check for pulses and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.550 
feel like they can check for pulses and
was<00:01:32.970> their<00:01:33.150> response<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> truly

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
was their response making it a truly

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
was their response making it a truly
educational<00:01:35.520> experience<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> safe

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
educational experience it's a safe

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
educational experience it's a safe
environment<00:01:36.570> everybody<00:01:37.200> works<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.650> well

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
environment everybody works really well

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
environment everybody works really well
together<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> team<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.630> feel

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
together as a team so they feel

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450 
together as a team so they feel
comfortable<00:01:40.320> asking<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.890> questions<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
comfortable asking the questions that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
comfortable asking the questions that
they<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.420> asking<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
they would not want to be asking in a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
they would not want to be asking in a
real-life<00:01:43.259> situation<00:01:43.409> may<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.310> greater<00:01:44.640> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
real-life situation may be greater they

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.310 
real-life situation may be greater they
responded<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.740> fact<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:48.030> good<00:01:48.780> code

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
responded well and in fact a good code

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
responded well and in fact a good code
