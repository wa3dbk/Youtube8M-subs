00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
because your peroxide will kind of go

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
because your peroxide will kind of go
flat<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> quarter<00:01:54.270> cup

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
flat it's so it's a quarter cup

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:08.639 
flat it's so it's a quarter cup
of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.460> alcohol

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:22.760 

quarter-cup<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.950> peroxide

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.240 

a<00:02:22.860> quarter<00:02:23.460> cup<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> vinegar<00:02:28.040> okay<00:02:29.040> we're

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
a quarter cup of the vinegar okay we're

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.090 
a quarter cup of the vinegar okay we're
gonna<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.550> ahead<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.090> wash<00:02:30.600> their<00:02:30.900> ears<00:02:31.110> out<00:02:31.440> I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
gonna go ahead and wash their ears out I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160 
gonna go ahead and wash their ears out I
recommend<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.750> take<00:02:33.960> them

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
recommend when you do this to take them

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.380 
recommend when you do this to take them
outside<00:02:34.440> because<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.520> will<00:02:35.670> probably<00:02:35.880> shake

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
outside because they will probably shake

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.950 
outside because they will probably shake
like<00:02:36.660> crazy<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.350> most<00:02:37.680> likely<00:02:37.920> roll<00:02:38.840> also<00:02:39.840> if

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
like crazy and most likely roll also if

whatever's<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> your<00:02:44.580> yard<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.800> let's<00:02:46.800> say<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.370 

the<00:02:51.680> ear<00:02:51.860> leathers<00:02:52.250> back<00:02:53.050> they<00:02:54.050> want<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.350> a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
the ear leathers back they want to be a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.410 
the ear leathers back they want to be a
tip<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.770> up<00:02:54.980> don't<00:02:55.190> squeeze<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.730> forcibly

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
tip this up don't squeeze it forcibly

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.170 
tip this up don't squeeze it forcibly
because<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.260> doesn't<00:02:57.560> really<00:02:57.680> take

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
because it doesn't really take

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.500 
because it doesn't really take
any<00:02:59.360> course<00:02:59.659> to<00:02:59.810> get<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.230> their<00:03:00.379> ears<00:03:01.510> so

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
any course to get this in their ears so

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.229 
any course to get this in their ears so
you<00:03:02.569> just<00:03:02.780> want<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.959> kind<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.200> let<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.239> dribble

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
you just want to kind of let it dribble

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.229 
you just want to kind of let it dribble
in<00:03:05.390> there<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:06.319> usually<00:03:06.620> what<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:08.060> I'll

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
in there and usually what I do is I'll

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.839 
in there and usually what I do is I'll
go<00:03:08.360> ahead<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.920> massage<00:03:10.099> their<00:03:10.519> ear<00:03:10.670> after

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
go ahead and massage their ear after

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:19.250 
go ahead and massage their ear after
it's<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.239> there<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.860> can<00:03:12.860> hear<00:03:13.040> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.199 

it's<00:03:19.800> like<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.950> think<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> fizzing<00:03:20.879> from<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
it's like I think the fizzing from the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.600 
it's like I think the fizzing from the
peroxide<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.930> what<00:03:22.140> makes<00:03:23.069> them<00:03:23.220> roll<00:03:23.430> and

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
peroxide is what makes them roll and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.520 
peroxide is what makes them roll and
everything<00:03:23.879> but<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.200> said<00:03:25.379> this

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
everything but this is like said this

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.020 
everything but this is like said this
will<00:03:25.650> break<00:03:25.799> down<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.159> wax<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.819> dirt

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
will break down that wax and the dirt

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.570 
will break down that wax and the dirt
and<00:03:27.209> stuff<00:03:27.420> that's<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.750> their<00:03:27.870> ears

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580
