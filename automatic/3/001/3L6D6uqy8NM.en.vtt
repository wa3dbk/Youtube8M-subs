then<00:06:40.060> let<00:06:40.300> me<00:06:40.480> understand<00:06:41.820> estimate<00:06:42.820> a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
then let me understand estimate a

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.790 
then let me understand estimate a
millimeter<00:06:43.330> estimate<00:06:43.720> invaded<00:06:44.080> by<00:06:44.200> the<00:06:44.260> equal

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
millimeter estimate invaded by the equal

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.550 
millimeter estimate invaded by the equal
to<00:06:44.980> say<00:06:45.600> it<00:06:46.600> kind<00:06:46.840> of<00:06:46.870> want<00:06:47.020> to<00:06:47.050> estimate<00:06:47.230> we

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
to say it kind of want to estimate we

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.710 
to say it kind of want to estimate we
need<00:06:47.710> a<00:06:47.860> basis<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.490> got<00:06:48.640> my<00:06:48.820> first<00:06:49.240> example
