00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:12.150
 Tokyo Fire Department last night at the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which is in a serious situation 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:19.199
 We resumed water discharge work 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:23.640
 In addition, the Self-Defense Forces scattered a large amount of debris that emits high levels of radioactivity around the reactor building. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.470
 In order to remove debris from being obstructed such as water discharge activity 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.470
 I decided to dispatch a tank 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.220
 E had been now ready for perfume 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.460
 It is a unit of the hyper rescue team but 21: 39 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.460
 It says that it has begun a water discharge to 21:39 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 Water drainage work to put water into the spent fuel pool that has lost its cooling function 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:59.719
 Tokyo Fire Department resumed a series 35 series water discharge from 9:30 last night 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.719
 It is expected that the water discharge will continue for about 6 hours because it is progressing smoothly 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 Aside from the third unit, the SDF released water for the first time for the first time yesterday for the first time 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:21.430
 It has been expected an effect of suppressing the release of cherry possible and radioactive material increases the pool water in the water 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:26.890
 The amount of radiation measured in the site tends to decrease from before the discharge of a child 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:31.500
 Also yesterday in the spent fuel pool of Unit 2 which has become similarly uncoolable 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.500
 Is that was injected 40 tons of seawater 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.409
 Disturbing this water release activity emits high value radiation 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.000
 A lot of debris 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:50.170
 Scattered around the reactor building due to hydrogen explosion 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.170
 The SDF decided to dispatch a tank to remove debris 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.860
 It is a water jet 74 type tank 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:05.410
 What the SDF focused on was the ability to remove this tank's debris and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.410
 It is a thick iron plate that removes the radiation 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.190
 It is in Gotemba City, Shizuoka Prefecture to be dispatched 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:20.550
 It is a quantity to the 74 type tank of Komakamon station 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.420
 In Asaka Shooting Range of the Ground Self-Defense Force for the supply of such trailers bet and fuel loaded with tanks 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.810
 I stopped by 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.080
 In order to keep the rubble in the front of the tank 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:37.000
 A big iron plate like a bulldozer was attached 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.000
 The tank is expected to arrive at the base near the site early in the morning 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.520
 On the other hand, it is being carried out in parallel with water discharge 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.520
 External power recovery work 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 For sending electricity to both the facility located in Unit 2 to Unit 1 and 3 at 2:46 pm yesterday in Unit 2 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.910
 Electricity was supplied to the switchboard 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:10.660
 If it is confirmed that the equipment is currently being inspected and that there is no problem, it will actually turn on electricity. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:16.750
 First of all, I would like to send electricity to the central control room at the center of the power plant. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:21.520
 The economic relationship in the revised month will receive power, so something like that 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:26.760
 What kind of crisis is it now when there is enka of central control room, and what kind of state is it now? 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.760
 I think that you can check it to some extent 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:39.310
 Tokyo Electric Power Company is in a hurry to restore power from Unit 3 to Unit 6 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:45.000
 In addition, according to TEPCO, the 5th and 6th units have nothing to do yesterday afternoon 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.000
 Water temperature in the reactor fell below 100 degrees indicating the safe state 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:56.880
 On the other hand , to the surface temperature of a nuclear power plant measured from a SDF helicopter 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.700
 On the containment vessel of Unit 3, it means that we measured 128 ways, but about this 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:06.340
 Kitazawa Minister's Cup 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.340
 According to experts, it was just above the core, so it was within the expected range.
