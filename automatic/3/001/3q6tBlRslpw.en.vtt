00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
years it first came out on the CBR

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.060 
years it first came out on the CBR
thousand<00:01:56.900> it's<00:01:57.900> being<00:01:58.110> developed<00:01:58.350> since<00:01:58.770> then

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
thousand it's being developed since then

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and this is the latest derivation of it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.370 
and this is the latest derivation of it
and<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.960> entirely<00:02:07.260> appropriate

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and we think it's entirely appropriate

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.859 
and we think it's entirely appropriate
that<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.310> style<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.910> braking<00:02:09.300> system<00:02:09.690> should

that that style of braking system should

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.210 
that that style of braking system should

must<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.700> braking<00:02:15.090> system<00:02:15.510> will

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
must say that the braking system will

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.090 
must say that the braking system will
take<00:02:15.840> some<00:02:16.020> getting<00:02:16.050> used<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.709> not

everyone will like it the fairing on the
other<00:02:19.740> hand<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.160> lowest<00:02:20.580> drag<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.910> its
