usually pretty good so if you if you
scroll<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> 20-year<00:01:41.610> average<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.270> guess<00:01:42.299> 21

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
scroll like a 20-year average i guess 21

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
scroll like a 20-year average i guess 21
is<00:01:43.290> averaged<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> United

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
is averaged actually for the United

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
is averaged actually for the United
States<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.939> anyway<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> acct<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
States but anyway so the acct is like a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.179 
States but anyway so the acct is like a
I<00:01:46.430> think<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.670> around<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:49.079> three-hour<00:01:49.770> test

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
I think it's around if three-hour test

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
I think it's around if three-hour test
and<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.850> split<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.119> four<00:01:51.479> parts<00:01:51.659> its

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and it's split into four parts its

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.440 
and it's split into four parts its
English<00:01:54.020> English<00:01:55.020> mathematics<00:01:56.240> reading<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
English English mathematics reading and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.780 
English English mathematics reading and
science<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:58.740> there<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.310> optional

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
science and then there is an optional

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.490 
science and then there is an optional
writing<00:02:00.479> portion<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> test<00:02:01.140> which<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.439> took

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
writing portion of the test which I took

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
writing portion of the test which I took
and<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> long<00:02:02.159> test<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.329> was<00:02:03.390> at

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and it was a long test and it was at

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
and it was a long test and it was at
eight<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> morning<00:02:04.170> which<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.799> don't<00:02:05.460> know

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
eight in the morning which I don't know

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.130 
eight in the morning which I don't know
why<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> test<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.840> early

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
why they make a test like that so early

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
why they make a test like that so early
and<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> Saturday<00:02:08.039> too<00:02:08.099> yes<00:02:09.000> today<00:02:09.239> is

higher score and yeah that's that for

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.020 
higher score and yeah that's that for
the<00:02:44.640> acct<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.220> finally<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.459> plans<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
the acct and finally my plans for the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.080 
the acct and finally my plans for the
live<00:02:48.239> stream<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:50.069> program<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.879> is

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
live stream is that the program that is

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.530 
live stream is that the program that is
on<00:02:51.300> my<00:02:51.420> computer<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:52.050> i<00:02:53.300> talked<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> them<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
on my computer is i talked to them a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.449 
on my computer is i talked to them a
little<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> they<00:02:55.590> said<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.890> program<00:02:56.310> is

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
little bit and they said the program is

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.490 
little bit and they said the program is
intended<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> higher-end<00:02:58.050> computer

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
intended for like a higher-end computer

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
intended for like a higher-end computer
than<00:02:58.650> mine<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:59.250> mine<00:02:59.459> isn't<00:02:59.760> like<00:02:59.879> capable

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
than mine like mine isn't like capable

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990 
than mine like mine isn't like capable
of<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.930> supporting<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.530> they<00:03:01.650> said<00:03:01.860> at<00:03:02.849> least

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
of like supporting it they said at least

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.670 
of like supporting it they said at least
of<00:03:03.180> my<00:03:03.209> system<00:03:03.599> requirements<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.230> my<00:03:04.319> system

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
of my system requirements of my system

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.130 
of my system requirements of my system
specs<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.430> stuff<00:03:05.519> um<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:07.760> HD<00:03:08.760> will

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
specs and all that stuff um so HD will

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.960 
specs and all that stuff um so HD will
probably<00:03:10.140> not<00:03:10.470> happen<00:03:11.159> if<00:03:11.310> i<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.610> get<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
probably not happen if i can get it to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.460 
probably not happen if i can get it to
work<00:03:12.120> correctly<00:03:12.420> um<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.480> probably<00:03:15.480> not<00:03:15.659> HD<00:03:16.170> but

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
work correctly um so probably not HD but

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.800 
work correctly um so probably not HD but
i'll<00:03:16.560> try<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.819> work<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.180> i<00:03:18.330> will<00:03:18.540> be

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
i'll try to get it to work but i will be

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.520 
i'll try to get it to work but i will be
doing<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.010> next<00:03:20.459> weekend<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.050> gonna

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
have said it caused issues with like the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.379 
have said it caused issues with like the
leg<00:05:49.129> in<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.400> game<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:49.789> it<00:05:50.509> yeah<00:05:50.960> um<00:05:51.560> that's<00:05:52.389> it

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
leg in the game and it yeah um that's it

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.059 
leg in the game and it yeah um that's it
goes<00:05:53.509> more<00:05:53.689> noticeable<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.169> ps3<00:05:54.499> like<00:05:54.889> black

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
goes more noticeable on ps3 like black

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.309 
goes more noticeable on ps3 like black
ops<00:05:55.279> 1<00:05:55.370> like<00:05:55.699> a<00:05:55.729> playground<00:05:56.300> more<00:05:56.509> goat<00:05:57.020> leg

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
ops 1 like a playground more goat leg

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.409 
ops 1 like a playground more goat leg
they<00:05:58.099> ever<00:05:58.310> heard<00:05:58.550> of<00:05:58.610> like<00:05:58.759> it's<00:05:58.999> like<00:05:59.180> host

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
they ever heard of like it's like host

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.119 
they ever heard of like it's like host
leg<00:05:59.719> basically<00:06:00.560> if<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.680> ever<00:06:00.770> heard<00:06:01.009> of<00:06:01.069> that

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
leg basically if you ever heard of that

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.249 
leg basically if you ever heard of that
that's<00:06:01.430> that's<00:06:01.729> basically<00:06:02.240> what<00:06:02.419> it's<00:06:02.539> caused

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
that's that's basically what it's caused

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.499 
that's that's basically what it's caused
by<00:06:03.289> is<00:06:03.560> like<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.919> leg<00:06:04.069> cop<00:06:04.310> and<00:06:04.520> then<00:06:04.639> the

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
by is like the leg cop and then the

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:06.879 
by is like the leg cop and then the
feeder<00:06:05.870> mode<00:06:06.050> because<00:06:06.199> the<00:06:06.409> theta<00:06:06.590> mode<00:06:06.770> is

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
feeder mode because the theta mode is

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.379 
feeder mode because the theta mode is
tied<00:06:07.099> to<00:06:07.219> the<00:06:07.310> host<00:06:07.520> and<00:06:09.639> it<00:06:10.639> looks<00:06:11.090> trying<00:06:11.300> to

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
tied to the host and it looks trying to

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.420 
tied to the host and it looks trying to
talk<00:06:11.539> to<00:06:11.569> the<00:06:11.719> entire<00:06:11.930> game<00:06:12.139> so<00:06:12.409> I'm<00:06:12.590> kind<00:06:13.400> of

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
talk to the entire game so I'm kind of

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.950 
talk to the entire game so I'm kind of
having<00:06:13.580> difficulties<00:06:14.120> a<00:06:14.150> funny<00:06:14.479> step<00:06:14.689> aside

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
having difficulties a funny step aside

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.709 
having difficulties a funny step aside
just<00:06:15.620> thought<00:06:15.919> of<00:06:16.129> oh<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:17.120> yeah<00:06:17.360> so<00:06:17.599> the

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
just thought of oh so yeah so the

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.809 
just thought of oh so yeah so the
quality<00:06:17.900> goes<00:06:18.289> so<00:06:18.620> it'll<00:06:19.189> be<00:06:19.219> harder<00:06:19.550> for<00:06:19.580> me

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
quality goes so it'll be harder for me

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.209 
quality goes so it'll be harder for me
to<00:06:20.090> record<00:06:20.810> like<00:06:21.050> past<00:06:21.379> games<00:06:21.680> like<00:06:21.949> an<00:06:22.069> theta

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
to record like past games like an theta

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.189 
to record like past games like an theta
mode<00:06:22.400> usually<00:06:23.270> for<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:23.509> 1v<00:06:23.779> ones<00:06:23.960> out<00:06:24.110> this

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
mode usually for the 1v ones out this

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.360 
mode usually for the 1v ones out this
recording<00:06:24.560> live<00:06:24.740> you<00:06:24.949> know<00:06:25.039> because<00:06:25.219> it's

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
recording live you know because it's

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.309 
recording live you know because it's
this<00:06:25.580> is<00:06:25.729> easier<00:06:26.060> for<00:06:26.210> me<00:06:26.300> and<00:06:26.419> it<00:06:26.479> always<00:06:26.719> it

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
this is easier for me and it always it

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.600 
this is easier for me and it always it
is<00:06:27.500> it<00:06:27.590> turns<00:06:27.770> out<00:06:27.919> better<00:06:28.129> because<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.370> know<00:06:28.520> if

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
is it turns out better because I know if

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.950 
is it turns out better because I know if

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
they know it has like issues where it

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.929 
they know it has like issues where it
doesn't<00:06:30.110> really<00:06:30.319> like<00:06:30.500> line<00:06:31.460> up<00:06:31.580> your<00:06:31.610> shots

doesn't really like line up your shots
correctly<00:06:32.360> like<00:06:32.569> how<00:06:32.689> you're<00:06:32.839> actually<00:06:33.020> aimed

correctly like how you're actually aimed

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.140 
correctly like how you're actually aimed
in<00:06:33.740> and<00:06:34.039> it<00:06:34.189> shows<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.639> missed<00:06:34.879> when<00:06:35.089> you

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.329 
in and it shows that you missed when you
hit<00:06:35.330> and<00:06:35.569> you<00:06:36.050> know<00:06:36.289> when<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:36.919> hit<00:06:37.069> when<00:06:37.249> you
