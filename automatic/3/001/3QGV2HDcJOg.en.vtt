00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
but i think that overall this would be a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
but i think that overall this would be a
good<00:01:50.520> thing<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.210> pass<00:01:51.420> because

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
good thing if this could pass because

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.719 
good thing if this could pass because
the<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.579> guys

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the way that I see this and you guys

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.429 
the way that I see this and you guys
tell<00:01:53.970> me<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
tell me what you think is that the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
tell me what you think is that the
reason<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> United<00:01:56.310> States<00:01:56.340> has<00:01:56.640> such<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
reason that the United States has such a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.780 
reason that the United States has such a
problem<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:58.189> alcoholism<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.640> with

drinking and with binge drinking is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.200 
drinking and with binge drinking is
because<00:02:01.920> there's<00:02:02.310> such<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> stigma<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.119> a

because there's such a stigma and a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
because there's such a stigma and a
taboo<00:02:03.570> around<00:02:03.810> drinking<00:02:04.350> until<00:02:04.469> you're<00:02:04.740> the

in Europe and the UK

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.400 
in Europe and the UK
and<00:02:10.459> Thailand<00:02:11.459> yeah<00:02:12.030> pretty<00:02:12.660> much<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and Thailand yeah pretty much if you can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.199 
and Thailand yeah pretty much if you can
grow<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> mustache<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> guy<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.090> can

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.500 
drink and I think that with that I
suppose<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:20.550> can't<00:02:20.760> change<00:02:21.060> their<00:02:21.300> that's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
suppose that I can't change their that's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
suppose that I can't change their that's
so<00:02:21.660> mean<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.800> acceptance<00:02:23.310> comes

think that allowing that drinking I mean
anything<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.269> illegal<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.140> then

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
anything that's illegal kind of then

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.440 
anything that's illegal kind of then
becomes<00:03:01.560> enticing<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> who<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.849> illegal<00:03:03.299> i

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
becomes enticing the who it's illegal i

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.789 
becomes enticing the who it's illegal i
should<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.019> i<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> because

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
should like this i want to do it because

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.280 
should like this i want to do it because
i<00:03:04.950> can't<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.459> yeah<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.239> i<00:03:06.269> think<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
i can't do it yeah but i think that and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.660 
i can't do it yeah but i think that and
you<00:03:07.530> know<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.980> another<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.519> of

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
you know and this is another one of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.160 
you know and this is another one of
those<00:03:08.819> issues<00:03:09.000> where<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> wasn't<00:03:09.870> around<00:03:09.930> when

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
those issues where I wasn't around when

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.420 
those issues where I wasn't around when
my<00:03:10.319> parents<00:03:10.470> were<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.830> college<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> don't

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
my parents were in college so I don't

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.309 
my parents were in college so I don't
know<00:03:11.580> but<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:11.940> say<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:12.540> think<00:03:12.599> that

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
know but they say that they think that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.870 
know but they say that they think that
the<00:03:13.440> higher<00:03:13.650> prevalence<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.670> there's<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the higher prevalence that there's a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.789 
the higher prevalence that there's a
much<00:03:15.090> higher<00:03:15.269> prevalence<00:03:15.570> today<00:03:16.109> of<00:03:16.440> underage

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
much higher prevalence today of underage

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.289 
much higher prevalence today of underage
drinking<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.310> binge<00:03:17.579> drinking<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
drinking and binge drinking in the

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.870 
drinking and binge drinking in the
perhaps<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:18.989> because<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.579> fact<00:03:20.760> that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
perhaps that is because of the fact that

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.759 
perhaps that is because of the fact that
you're<00:03:21.060> not<00:03:21.150> allowed<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.510> drink<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.230> know<00:03:22.350> 18

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
you're not allowed to drink you know 18

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.229 
you're not allowed to drink you know 18
and<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:22.950> beer<00:03:23.220> any<00:03:23.370> more<00:03:23.579> than<00:03:23.730> three<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.060> bear

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
and up beer any more than three to bear

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.360 
and up beer any more than three to bear
so<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:25.079> in<00:03:25.410> my<00:03:25.560> opinion<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:26.069> good<00:03:26.280> that

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
so I think in my opinion it's good that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.970 
so I think in my opinion it's good that
the<00:03:26.489> states<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:27.000> these<00:03:27.180> laws<00:03:27.709> where<00:03:28.709> people

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the states have these laws where people

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.349 
the states have these laws where people
are<00:03:29.100> allowed<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> drink<00:03:29.670> apparently<00:03:30.060> also<00:03:30.180> in

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
are allowed to drink apparently also in

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.809 
are allowed to drink apparently also in
Colorado<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.260> drink<00:03:31.739> legally<00:03:32.220> at<00:03:32.549> home

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
Colorado you can drink legally at home

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.420 
Colorado you can drink legally at home
with<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> parent<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:33.900> you're<00:03:34.500> 18<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.190> stop

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
with a parent if you're 18 I can stop

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.520 
with a parent if you're 18 I can stop
you<00:03:35.579> well<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.060> how<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.299> catch<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.200> um

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you well and how they catch you so um

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.500 
you well and how they catch you so um
yeah<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> think<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.489> anything<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:38.940> makes<00:03:39.209> so

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
yeah I think that anything that makes so

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.000 
yeah I think that anything that makes so
that<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> first<00:03:39.959> time<00:03:40.230> somebody<00:03:40.650> goes<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
that the first time somebody goes to a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.500 
that the first time somebody goes to a
frat<00:03:41.220> party<00:03:41.250> they<00:03:41.670> don't<00:03:41.819> absolutely<00:03:42.120> lose

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
frat party they don't absolutely lose

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.259 
frat party they don't absolutely lose
their<00:03:42.870> shit<00:03:43.200> like<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:44.340> oh<00:03:44.459> my<00:03:44.700> god<00:03:44.910> i<00:03:44.940> can

their shit like because oh my god i can

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.150 
their shit like because oh my god i can

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
drink if I want to like it should just

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
drink if I want to like it should just
be<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.730> steady<00:03:48.090> gradient<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.750> slightly

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
be like a steady gradient of slightly

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.229 
be like a steady gradient of slightly
more<00:03:49.410> familiarity<00:03:49.889> with<00:03:50.130> drinking<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.880> then

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
more familiarity with drinking and then

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.520 
more familiarity with drinking and then
you're<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.389> party<00:03:51.810> might<00:03:52.049> drink<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.319> little<00:03:52.410> bit

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you're a party might drink a little bit

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.750 
you're a party might drink a little bit
more<00:03:52.680> than<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.950> would<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> restaurant

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
more than you would at a restaurant

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.849 
more than you would at a restaurant
family<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:54.389> shouldn't<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:54.780> crazy<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.470> I

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
family but shouldn't go crazy and I

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.890 
family but shouldn't go crazy and I
think<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.850> sort<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.359> weird

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
think that that this is sort of a weird

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.770 
think that that this is sort of a weird
remnant<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.769> prohibition<00:03:59.730> that<00:04:00.030> we<00:04:00.600> don't

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
remnant of prohibition that we don't

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.000 
remnant of prohibition that we don't
think<00:04:01.019> they<00:04:01.109> should<00:04:01.139> be<00:04:01.350> allowed<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.530> well<00:04:01.889> and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
think they should be allowed to well and

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.979 
think they should be allowed to well and
I<00:04:02.069> think<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.430> same<00:04:02.670> thing<00:04:02.910> goes<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.150> sex<00:04:03.750> like

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
I think the same thing goes for sex like

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.930 
I think the same thing goes for sex like
in<00:04:04.139> households<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.829> teach<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.370> sex<00:04:05.700> is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
in households that teach that sex is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.300 
in households that teach that sex is
okay<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.450> sex<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.840> normal<00:04:07.109> part<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.500> human

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
okay and sex is a normal part of human

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.680 
okay and sex is a normal part of human
life<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.790> need<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.120> safe<00:04:09.389> about

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
life and that you need to be safe about

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.410 
life and that you need to be safe about
it<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:10.380> see<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> lot<00:04:10.980> higher<00:04:11.190> rates<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.850> safe

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420
