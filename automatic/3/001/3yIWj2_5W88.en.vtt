a<00:01:13.080> thermal<00:01:13.470> store<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.689> stove<00:01:15.689> has<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
a thermal store this stove has got a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200 
a thermal store this stove has got a
back<00:01:16.259> boiler<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> heats<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> water<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
back boiler so it heats the water as the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
back boiler so it heats the water as the
fuel<00:01:18.420> burns<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.650> comes<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.189> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
fuel burns and the water comes out of in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.560 
fuel burns and the water comes out of in
and<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.299> two<00:01:21.540> pipes<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> goes<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and out of these two pipes and goes to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
and out of these two pipes and goes to
the<00:01:24.689> pipes<00:01:25.159> which<00:01:26.159> we've<00:01:26.340> already<00:01:26.520> installed

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the pipes which we've already installed

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
the pipes which we've already installed
that<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> thermal<00:01:28.229> store<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that go up to the thermal store so the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
that go up to the thermal store so the
fuel<00:01:29.939> heats<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> water<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.500> water<00:01:31.710> comes<00:01:32.040> out

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
fuel heats the water the water comes out

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
fuel heats the water the water comes out
up<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> thermal<00:01:33.900> store<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.979> cooled

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
up to the thermal store when it's cooled

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
up to the thermal store when it's cooled
down<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.610> comes<00:01:35.790> back<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
down it comes back in and going to be

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.830 
down it comes back in and going to be
heated<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> continuous<00:01:38.189> flow

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
heated up so it's a continuous flow

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
heated up so it's a continuous flow
using<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> energy<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> heat<00:01:41.549> produced

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
using the energy from the heat produced

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
using the energy from the heat produced
by<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> wood-burning<00:01:42.479> stove<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.470> heat<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
by the wood-burning stove to heat the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.399 
by the wood-burning stove to heat the
hot<00:01:43.890> water<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> same<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:45.259> energy<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
hot water at the same time energy and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
hot water at the same time energy and
efficiency<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.880> eighteen<00:01:48.420> quarter<00:01:48.899> inches<00:01:50.509> in

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
efficiency so eighteen quarter inches in

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
efficiency so eighteen quarter inches in
the<00:01:51.659> bottom<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.590> we'll<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.040> pull

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the bottom and then we'll have to pull

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.920 
the bottom and then we'll have to pull

curing on the appliance so nowadays we
have<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.630> issue<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:27.200> carbon

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
have to we have to issue a carbon

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.970 
have to we have to issue a carbon
monoxide<00:03:27.980> detector<00:03:28.400> with<00:03:29.000> all<00:03:29.180> new<00:03:29.360> stoves<00:03:29.980> so

monoxide detector with all new stoves so

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.190 
monoxide detector with all new stoves so
we<00:03:31.220> recommend<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.820> it's<00:03:32.000> not<00:03:32.210> in<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.960> actual

carbon monoxide detector isn't installed

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.880 
carbon monoxide detector isn't installed
for<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.450> first<00:03:35.690> couple<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:36.020> days<00:03:36.170> at<00:03:36.440> least<00:03:36.470> of

come<00:03:39.170> off<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.320> appliance<00:03:39.880> I'm<00:03:40.880> confident

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
come off the appliance I'm confident

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.120 
come off the appliance I'm confident
that<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.780> air<00:03:41.930> controls<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.530> working<00:03:42.560> out<00:03:42.950> it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
that the air controls are working out it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:51.000 
that the air controls are working out it
should<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.430> working<00:03:46.930> except<00:03:47.930> everything<00:03:48.410> down

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.980 

hopefully<00:03:52.010> should<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.730> literally<00:03:53.510> die<00:03:53.690> out

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
hopefully should just literally die out

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:04.899 
hopefully should just literally die out
there's<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:55.010> over

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.550
