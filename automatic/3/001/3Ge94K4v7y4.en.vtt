00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 unlike searching for a new coach for 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.910
 teams at the Spartak stadium under construction 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 opposite 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 work is in full swing construction 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
 brigades according to the football scheme 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.759
 shared into several groups 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 basis is involved on the curb and on 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.320
 tribunes on the shoulders of their comrades finish 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.539
 indoor arena what's up 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.449
 fields then natural turf will appear here 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 closer to the opening of the stadium planted yet 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 that lonely is worth knowing Spartacus soon 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.529
 here will be all filled literally through 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 three months chair almost everything 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.620
 set now we go and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 let's see what Spartak hospital expects 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 brand new carro only to seat 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.969
 soon army will complement their red-white 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 brothers 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 46 thousand fans will accommodate a new arena 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.550
 Spartacus 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
 the fact that this stadium was prepared for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 no serious international matches 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 the naked eye even the name 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.090
 home team performed large 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 in Latin letters and here they are 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 arena attributes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 plastic seats give check 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 how comfortable it is to sit well let's say not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.460
 especially comfort and space is wrong 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 a lot but generally okay held 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 holds tight enough but how 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.030
 says perseverance and work and fans 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.010
 Spartacus all fight 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.049
 and this place is for more privileged 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.299
 fans these seats in general 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.549
 performed just like the last but 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.250
 insults and something soft now try 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.479
 how comfortable it is to sit here 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.619
 really much better here yes and 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.009
 is these sat in general then 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.520
 in the middle of a beat for football will be better 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.130
 we'll see 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.979
 and goals and dangerous moments well that's all 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.840
 emotions of coaches and players 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.360
 ready to work and 2 handsome screen 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.259
 now of course in the abyss of working dust they 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.789
 not to say that it is very much in demand 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.100
 we are now at the highest 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.229
 the point of the arena for fans need to review 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.909
 say pretty good from here 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.140
 fans can make out what schemes 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.360
 play teams 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.520
 but to identify players will be able to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.979
 only fans with very good 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.259
 sight the first unofficial guests 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.369
 Arena steel and unrecoverable 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.380
 Spartak fan 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.900
 Eugene tiled whales like 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.819
 relies come with gifts of his boots 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.310
 and autographed play t-shirt 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.290
 teammates from the past will become 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.989
 the first exhibits of the museum Spartacus 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.650
 which will also appear on the territory 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.940
 arenas i'm sure that everything is fanatical 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 the motion will report back 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.100
 the fact that what they will do but 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.350
 The stadium certainly definitely needs 1 slightly 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.170
 respect your stadium respect respect 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 those investors who gave such 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.300
 such a stadium to the people's team current 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.340
 star fans have already looked after themselves 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180
 home viewing spots 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.960
 Spartacus 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.300
 I count was 2007 when they laid 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.940
 personalized capsule 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.850
 she still opened 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.460
 mayor of the capital as simon of the capital yuri 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.900
 meadows but very beautiful I could not 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.450
 present the essence or symmetry map 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.940
 here we will have a beautiful stadium 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.400
 see the whole sheet everything is fine but of course 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.020
 it's all a building process in a month you 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.480
 we do if in a different way and emotions 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.659
 of course the very moment is positive 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.760
 I understand that I did not have time to play 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.690
 this stadium as acting 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.900
 weaker 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.150
 as a terran VIP bed on the podium and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.909
 changing rooms and showers are true 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.400
 still at work but despite this the main 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.290
 part can be said done and let 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.890
 Today, fans of red and whites are not afraid 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.019
 not the brightest look of the new arena 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.120
 July 24, when the opening match for this 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.750
 the stadium will take Belgrade 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.610
 frankly the star will sparkle
