00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.260
 a few seconds two very special teams 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.270
 are not two very familiar teams that the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.910
 environment management and players 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.610
 everything is to start a family and makes 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.380
 the players who are lucky 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.189
 of playing in both teams because we 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.189
 feel at home 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.279
 good the difference mainly 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.040
 because they are in different countries but 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.379
 also in the type of football that there is in 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.699
 in this league and that is practiced differently 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.410
 now 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.220
 there are similarities that are two big 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.360
 teams are always with the option of 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.360
 to win any championship 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.220
 as I believe that the best one that I have marked 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.220
 the final at the end 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.890
 obviously to the being of the earth then 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.590
 had had two that were those one a 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 side because it was from Navarre and on the other hand 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.450
 law and why because my brother plays 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.310
 then when he was a little older 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 good had as an idol to fernando 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.560
 towers- so yes it looked a lot 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560
 now of madrid type 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.200
 and meats that thiago 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.450
 everything is alright 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.810
 frank is one of the fastest there 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.810
 there is the answer 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.470
 but it is also fast 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.149
 I always had my father who was the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.250
 inside indoors example and the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.460
 field but if I had to choose 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 sport characters supplies 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.030
 it would be wrong but good I had the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.900
 lucky to grow up with miguel indurain that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 it was also in my land 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.379
 We all Navarre have 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.569
 sense very identified with him from 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.299
 always just touched me the time in which 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.610
 won the five tours of france that I 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.819
 I was five years old 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 6 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.609
 and because of that since then 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.609
 I always had him as an idol
