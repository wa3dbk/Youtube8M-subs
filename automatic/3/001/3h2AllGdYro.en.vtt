for your iPod Touch or iPhone so let's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.270 
for your iPod Touch or iPhone so let's
try<00:01:53.880> 11.4<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.200> three<00:01:55.560> lists

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
try 11.4 and there are like three lists

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
try 11.4 and there are like three lists
as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> pi<00:01:57.750> friendly<00:01:58.049> links

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
as you can see I pi friendly links

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
as you can see I pi friendly links
therefore<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.130> mean<00:01:59.369> three<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.630> need<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
therefore I mean three that you need to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.990 
therefore I mean three that you need to
be<00:02:01.020> trust<00:02:01.320> doing<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.490> probably<00:02:02.969> work

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
be trust doing that will probably work

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450

already<00:02:56.459> at<00:02:56.610> 20%<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> I'm<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.290> gonna<00:02:58.410> cut<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680

so we're at 100% now there it is

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.979 
so we're at 100% now there it is
I'm<00:03:15.790> seeing<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.599> should<00:03:16.750> give<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.930> a

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
I'm seeing so you should give it a

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.520 
I'm seeing so you should give it a
second<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.530> hit<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.340> home<00:03:18.430> button<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:20.230> hit

second and hit the home button then hit

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.600 
second and hit the home button then hit
install<00:03:20.920> us<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.280> want<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.459> go<00:03:24.549> to

install us and then you want to go to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.809 
install us and then you want to go to
downloads<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.330> then<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.500> should<00:03:27.010> be<00:03:27.250> there

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819
