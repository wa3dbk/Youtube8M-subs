particular<00:00:33.550> page<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.239> first<00:00:34.510> of<00:00:34.660> all<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:35.050> have

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
particular page so first of all I have

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.500 
particular page so first of all I have
the<00:00:35.679> navigation<00:00:35.890> that<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.579> moved<00:00:36.850> up<00:00:37.149> near<00:00:37.449> the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
the navigation that I moved up near the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.319 
the navigation that I moved up near the
top<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.929> the<00:00:38.140> page<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.710> these<00:00:39.370> ain't<00:00:39.730> these<00:00:40.030> on

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
top of the page and these ain't these on

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.860 
top of the page and these ain't these on
navigation<00:00:40.929> points<00:00:41.499> are<00:00:41.679> linked<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.940> anchors

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
navigation points are linked to anchors

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.549

so<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:44.949> other<00:00:45.069> words<00:00:45.339> if<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:46.120> look<00:00:46.899> at<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.140> link

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
so in other words if we look at the link

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.799 
so in other words if we look at the link
here<00:00:47.949> it's<00:00:48.519> showing<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:48.969> it's<00:00:49.239> linked<00:00:49.569> to<00:00:49.690> an

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809

anchor called River launch and of course

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.759 
anchor called River launch and of course
we<00:00:52.089> could<00:00:52.239> see<00:00:52.389> the<00:00:52.510> anchor<00:00:52.870> icon<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.530> let<00:00:53.679> us

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
we could see the anchor icon to let us

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.559

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
thing with the with the cove if we click

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.049 
thing with the with the cove if we click
on<00:00:58.479> that<00:00:58.659> one<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.559> an<00:00:59.769> anchor<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.579> Scrolls

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
on that one it's an anchor that Scrolls

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.989 
on that one it's an anchor that Scrolls
down<00:01:01.209> on<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.719> same<00:01:02.019> page<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.489> dust<00:01:03.699> in<00:01:03.909> the

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.630 
but not least I've got this entire
object<00:01:39.310> everything<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:40.210> this<00:01:40.329> layer<00:01:40.600> pinned

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
object everything on this layer pinned

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.190 
object everything on this layer pinned
to<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.759> top<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.270> page<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:43.780> if<00:01:43.869> we<00:01:43.960> look<00:01:43.990> at

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
to the top of the page so if we look at

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
the pinning its pinned to the top so
