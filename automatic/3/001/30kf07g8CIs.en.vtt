well<00:01:11.870> batteries<00:01:12.650> week<00:01:13.000> every<00:01:14.000> guys<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> bad

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
well batteries week every guys the bad

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.920 
well batteries week every guys the bad
well<00:01:15.880> week<00:01:16.880> or<00:01:17.060> bad<00:01:17.270> both<00:01:18.550> I'd<00:01:19.550> replace<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.150> but

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
well week or bad both I'd replace it but

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.810 
well week or bad both I'd replace it but
if<00:01:21.050> you're<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.290> agreeing<00:01:21.590> you're<00:01:21.740> fine<00:01:22.010> okay

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
if you're in agreeing you're fine okay

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.570 
if you're in agreeing you're fine okay
how<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.180> works<00:01:23.480> is<00:01:24.160> when<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.220> push<00:01:25.460> this

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
how this works is when you push this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.390 
how this works is when you push this
button<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.260> complete<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.590> circuit<00:01:28.010> inside

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
button and complete the circuit inside

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.250 
button and complete the circuit inside
there<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:30.250> resistor<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.990> see<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.110> there

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
there is a resistor you see that there

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.910 
there is a resistor you see that there
you<00:01:33.350> go<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.970> resistor<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.530> heating

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you go see the resistor like a heating

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.100 
you go see the resistor like a heating
element<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.020> does<00:01:39.230> get<00:01:39.470> hot<00:01:39.680> when<00:01:40.430> you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
element and it does get hot when you

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.920 
element and it does get hot when you
push<00:01:42.110> this<00:01:42.260> button<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:44.270> count<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.660> five

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
push this button and you count the five

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.080 
push this button and you count the five
or<00:01:45.260> ten<00:01:45.440> seconds<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.400> said<00:01:46.610> five<00:01:46.820> should

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
or ten seconds like I said five should

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
or ten seconds like I said five should
be<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.450> than<00:01:47.570> adequate<00:01:48.550> that<00:01:50.980> creates<00:01:51.980> the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
be more than adequate that creates the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.590 
be more than adequate that creates the
resistance<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.560> well<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:56.270> hot<00:01:56.420> okay<00:01:57.310> well

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
resistance and well it's hot okay well

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.890 
resistance and well it's hot okay well
let's<00:01:59.600> go<00:01:59.720> check<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.050> truck<00:02:00.350> battery

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.850 

alright<00:02:04.900> here's<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> battery<00:02:05.380> we're<00:02:05.740> going

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
alright here's the battery we're going

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.150 
alright here's the battery we're going
to<00:02:05.920> be<00:02:06.010> load<00:02:06.220> testing<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> start<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.040> it

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
to be load testing I want to start it it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.500 
to be load testing I want to start it it
was<00:02:09.280> hard<00:02:09.520> start<00:02:11.970> barely<00:02:12.970> ever<00:02:13.060> start<00:02:13.390> this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
was hard start barely ever start this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.410 
was hard start barely ever start this
vehicle<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.470> lot<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.180> we're<00:02:16.330> going

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
vehicle it's it's a lot so we're going

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.030 
vehicle it's it's a lot so we're going
to<00:02:16.480> check<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> voltage<00:02:16.900> here's<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.680> digital

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
to check the voltage here's my digital

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.650 
to check the voltage here's my digital
multimeter<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.850> auto-ranging

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
multimeter it's auto-ranging

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.470 
multimeter it's auto-ranging
so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.610> hooked<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.880> properly<00:02:22.240> down

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so we have it hooked up properly down

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.360 
so we have it hooked up properly down
here<00:02:23.160> when<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.220> put<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.580> volts

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
here when I put it on volts

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.040 
here when I put it on volts

it'll make it through this video so I
got<00:02:44.770> on<00:02:44.920> direct<00:02:45.190> current<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.730> Auto<00:02:45.970> ranging

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
got on direct current it's Auto ranging

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.020 
got on direct current it's Auto ranging
so<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.870> don't<00:02:47.020> have<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.520> adjust<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:48.850> on

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
so you don't have to adjust it like on

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.120 
so you don't have to adjust it like on
some<00:02:49.240> multimeters<00:02:49.750> you'll<00:02:49.930> see<00:02:50.080> two<00:02:50.380> zero<00:02:50.740> two

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
some multimeters you'll see two zero two

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.430 
some multimeters you'll see two zero two
hundred<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.730> two<00:02:51.850> thousand<00:02:52.450> two<00:02:52.660> fee<00:02:52.900> C<00:02:53.140> and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
hundred and two thousand two fee C and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.620 
hundred and two thousand two fee C and
same<00:02:54.130> as<00:02:54.310> for<00:02:54.460> AC<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:55.210> do<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.450> you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
same as for AC you don't do this you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.500 
same as for AC you don't do this you
just<00:02:55.660> put<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.080> V<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.530> ranges<00:02:57.460> itself<00:02:57.880> so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
just put it on V and ranges itself so

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.010 
just put it on V and ranges itself so
red<00:02:58.780> lead<00:02:59.020> it's<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.980> positive<00:03:00.160> terminal<00:03:01.020> black

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
red lead it's a positive terminal black

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.610 
red lead it's a positive terminal black
lead<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.470> negative<00:03:02.620> terminal<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.500> get

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
lead to negative terminal now you get

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.890 
lead to negative terminal now you get
eleven<00:03:05.890> point<00:03:06.100> seven<00:03:06.280> five<00:03:07.470> now<00:03:09.840> supposed<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
eleven point seven five now supposed to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.620 
eleven point seven five now supposed to
be<00:03:10.959> around<00:03:11.170> twelve<00:03:11.500> point<00:03:11.770> six<00:03:12.010> two<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
be around twelve point six two is the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.290 
be around twelve point six two is the
goal<00:03:13.840> law<00:03:14.410> anything<00:03:14.890> north<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.220> twelve<00:03:15.489> twelve

on six volt or 12 volt batteries you
charge<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.959> hook<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.590> charges<00:03:41.830> the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
charge you hook it up it charges the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.650 
charge you hook it up it charges the
battery<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.090> full<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> full<00:03:45.660> voltage

and<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.530> amperage<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:48.130> then<00:03:48.970> once<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.330> hits

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and the amperage and then once it hits

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.770 
and the amperage and then once it hits
that<00:03:50.040> it'll<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.519> start<00:03:52.030> maintaining<00:03:52.239> it

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
that it'll just start maintaining it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.360 
that it'll just start maintaining it
it'll<00:03:52.930> shut<00:03:53.110> itself<00:03:53.380> off<00:03:53.620> turn<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:53.920> stuff<00:03:54.190> on

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
it'll shut itself off turn it stuff on

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.100 
it'll shut itself off turn it stuff on
in<00:03:54.820> other<00:03:54.970> words<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.390> could<00:03:55.510> set<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.870> forget

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
in other words you could set it forget

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.440 
in other words you could set it forget
it<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:56.980> that's<00:03:57.160> what<00:03:57.280> we're<00:03:57.400> gonna<00:03:57.489> do<00:03:57.760> we're

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
it so that's what we're gonna do we're

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.670 
it so that's what we're gonna do we're
gonna<00:04:01.680> hook<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.769> up<00:04:03.720> let<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.840> charge<00:04:05.110> for<00:04:05.500> about

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
gonna hook it up let it charge for about

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.150 
gonna hook it up let it charge for about
six<00:04:06.010> hours<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.050> go<00:04:08.200> fishing<00:04:08.440> come<00:04:08.800> back

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
six hours and we go fishing come back

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.550 
six hours and we go fishing come back
and<00:04:09.430> then

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and then

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.909 
and then
load<00:04:11.310> testing<00:04:13.910> are<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.090> plugged<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.480> in<00:04:15.919> as

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
load testing are you plugged it in as

you<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:17.970> see<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:19.680> charging<00:04:20.579> once<00:04:20.970> it's

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
you can see is charging once it's

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.860 
you can see is charging once it's
charged<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.810> they'll<00:04:21.900> start<00:04:22.109> maintaining

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
charged it and they'll start maintaining

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.159 
charged it and they'll start maintaining
so<00:04:26.540> let<00:04:27.540> her<00:04:27.660> sit<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.590> charge<00:04:29.870> down<00:04:30.870> below

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
all right last battery we load tested

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.890 
all right last battery we load tested
was<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.740> weak<00:06:10.740> battery<00:06:11.420> it's<00:06:12.420> not<00:06:12.630> strong

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
was a weak battery it's not strong

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.460 
was a weak battery it's not strong
enough<00:06:13.140> to<00:06:14.060> turn<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.240> car<00:06:15.450> a<00:06:15.480> couple<00:06:15.630> times<00:06:15.990> it

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
enough to turn the car a couple times it

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.010 
enough to turn the car a couple times it
failed<00:06:16.740> our<00:06:16.940> it<00:06:17.940> came<00:06:18.120> up<00:06:18.240> weak<00:06:18.450> on<00:06:18.660> our<00:06:18.810> load

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
failed our it came up weak on our load

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.240 
failed our it came up weak on our load
test<00:06:21.590> so<00:06:22.590> now<00:06:22.710> we're<00:06:22.800> going<00:06:22.890> to<00:06:22.980> do<00:06:23.100> this

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
test so now we're going to do this

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.490 
test so now we're going to do this
battery<00:06:23.670> which<00:06:24.270> is<00:06:24.300> not<00:06:24.600> good<00:06:24.870> one<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.410> you

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
battery which is not good one so you

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.130 
battery which is not good one so you
have<00:06:25.530> an<00:06:25.680> example<00:06:26.040> of<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.430> poor<00:06:27.210> battery<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:27.960> a

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
have an example of a poor battery and a

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.770 
have an example of a poor battery and a
good<00:06:28.320> battery<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:30.060> way<00:06:30.150> you<00:06:30.210> can<00:06:30.330> compare<00:06:30.660> it

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
good battery that way you can compare it

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.620 
good battery that way you can compare it
side-by-side<00:06:32.180> so<00:06:33.380> again<00:06:34.380> positive<00:06:34.620> positive

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
side-by-side so again positive positive

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.630 
side-by-side so again positive positive
or<00:06:36.630> read<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:36.960> positive<00:06:37.110> like<00:06:37.950> negative<00:06:38.430> I'll

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
or read the positive like negative I'll

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.680 
or read the positive like negative I'll
eventually<00:06:38.970> get<00:06:39.210> it<00:06:39.330> right<00:06:39.480> one<00:06:39.660> day<00:06:39.860> okay

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
eventually get it right one day okay

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.920 
eventually get it right one day okay
you<00:06:42.690> see<00:06:42.900> we're<00:06:43.110> up<00:06:43.230> to<00:06:46.430> 12<00:06:47.430> points<00:06:48.090> some<00:06:48.330> six

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
you see we're up to 12 points some six

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.330 
you see we're up to 12 points some six
some<00:06:49.170> volts<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.860> checked<00:06:50.130> it<00:06:50.220> with<00:06:50.310> a

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
some volts I checked it with a

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.640 
some volts I checked it with a
multimeter<00:06:50.910> but<00:06:51.840> right<00:06:52.020> there<00:06:52.200> it's<00:06:52.320> as<00:06:52.440> close

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
multimeter but right there it's as close

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.730 
multimeter but right there it's as close
to<00:06:52.710> 13<00:06:53.250> so<00:06:53.690> we're<00:06:54.690> going<00:06:54.780> to<00:06:54.840> low<00:06:54.960> test<00:06:55.230> it<00:06:55.410> like

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
to 13 so we're going to low test it like

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.740 
to 13 so we're going to low test it like
it's<00:06:56.010> 540<00:06:56.820> cold<00:06:57.180> cranking<00:06:57.480> amps<00:06:58.370> so<00:06:59.750> let's

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
it's 540 cold cranking amps so let's

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.120 
it's 540 cold cranking amps so let's
load<00:07:00.960> test<00:07:01.200> it<00:07:03.290> two<00:07:04.290> one<00:07:04.500> thousand<00:07:04.860> three<00:07:04.950> one

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
load test it two one thousand three one

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.620 
load test it two one thousand three one
thousand<00:07:05.700> four<00:07:05.730> one<00:07:05.880> thousand<00:07:06.420> five<00:07:06.570> one

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
thousand four one thousand five one

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.240 
thousand four one thousand five one
thousand<00:07:07.260> six<00:07:07.380> one<00:07:07.530> thousand<00:07:08.040> see<00:07:08.160> how

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
thousand six one thousand see how

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.760 
thousand six one thousand see how
staying<00:07:08.610> in<00:07:08.790> the<00:07:08.880> 600<00:07:09.330> range<00:07:09.510> that's<00:07:10.410> real

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
staying in the 600 range that's real

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:18.160 
staying in the 600 range that's real
good<00:07:11.060> that<00:07:12.060> was<00:07:12.150> more<00:07:12.360> than<00:07:12.480> ten<00:07:13.610> right<00:07:14.610> there

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.159 

stayed<00:07:19.170> in<00:07:19.320> this<00:07:19.470> 600<00:07:19.920> range

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.040 

so<00:07:24.879> there<00:07:25.879> you<00:07:25.909> go<00:07:26.180> that's<00:07:26.479> a<00:07:26.719> good<00:07:26.870> battery

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
so there you go that's a good battery

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.360 
so there you go that's a good battery
when<00:07:30.050> we<00:07:30.169> test<00:07:30.409> earlier<00:07:32.800> there's<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:33.889> thousand

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370 
when we test earlier there's a thousand

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.149 
when we test earlier there's a thousand
and<00:07:35.139> supposed<00:07:36.139> to<00:07:36.199> be<00:07:36.259> in<00:07:36.319> between<00:07:36.560> that<00:07:36.949> line

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:37.159 
and supposed to be in between that line

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.659 
and supposed to be in between that line
right<00:07:37.370> there

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:37.669 
right there

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.619 
right there
you<00:07:38.330> went<00:07:38.479> all<00:07:38.569> the<00:07:38.629> way<00:07:38.689> down<00:07:38.870> to<00:07:38.990> two<00:07:39.789> so<00:07:40.789> that

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:41.629 
you went all the way down to two so that

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.510 
you went all the way down to two so that
battery's<00:07:42.020> toast<00:07:42.349> time<00:07:43.159> to<00:07:43.249> get<00:07:43.370> a<00:07:43.400> new

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
battery's toast time to get a new

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.719 
battery's toast time to get a new
