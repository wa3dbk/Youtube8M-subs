00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 today we will look at the constructor 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.470
 from the company lego series hero factory or 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.450
 hero factory 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 freezing robot stroma on how are you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.530
 you see the designer I have already assembled it 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.530
 delivered in such a beautiful package 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.030
 also found with him 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.620
 instruction 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.090
 all 88 parts in the constructor 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.290
 it can also be done all sorts 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.860
 various modifications by other robots 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.030
 what will I do next releases we 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.040
 see with you what you can 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.180
 make beautiful cool modifications 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.400
 general hero factory series 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.950
 my colleague's return began 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.059
 I fired up this designer because 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.989
 that I like very much 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.530
 various biomechanical robot and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.220
 exosuits 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.720
 which is very clear and well expressed here 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.800
 let's see it in more detail 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.620
 The kit includes 2 jumpers of the storm itself and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.050
 his fighting machine despite the fact that 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.640
 jumper so small they have 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:19.270
 opportunity so you jump about flew away so 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.780
 but the storm side itself is equipped now I 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.870
 closer 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.390
 why such a special suit 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.970
 pistol and some had plans 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.580
 addition to data transfer is possible 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 You may need to touch their robot on 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.040
 it also has a distance of 4 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 why did I tell you a little later now 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.530
 we move on to our how to suit or 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.570
 robot side he is able to very powerful 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.930
 huge legs that allows him 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.149
 keep balance also have a beginning 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.360
 huge mechanical hand what 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.940
 allows me to grab jumpers on 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 You can also put the fly so that it takes 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 [music] 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 with his other hand he can freeze 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.860
 [music] 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.880
 envy such a coil which can 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 twist and so it freezes 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.330
 even before our second time oh jumper 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.180
 so the design 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.939
 robot yes it is stable 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.480
 no slayer hope his main self 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.730
 the skeleton because it performed 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.500
 well enough 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.840
 reliably that it seems to me that since 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.220
 here these tanks will be on the cap see how 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.640
 would my legs wobble 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.440
 and further 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.240
 of our 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.170
 here so the robot has two rocket number 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.270
 himself and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 homing which he also 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.640
 shoots oh oh flew out locator 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.550
 radio antenna for data transmission and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.600
 flasher looks like and well behind him here 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.540
 so here are the pharmacies for freezing jumpers 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:20.469
 that is, when he catches them he 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:25.150
 placed in this compartment now placed in 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:28.900
 bay scan and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 and transmits your center data and also you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.640
 can then omit if we open 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.640
 this way was 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.730
 how does the storm itself fit 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.909
 my car 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.700
 takeaway glass take by storm and just 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:55.419
 here this pin lever serves for that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.840
 so that the side sat tightly with her 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:05.910
 combat vehicle 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:09.300
 now we are 100 to Corbin tight 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.610
 closes and looks pretty quiet 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.519
 very cool powerfully very cool 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.079
 I recommend this kit 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.060
 conclusion I want to say that the company 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.790
 Oleg I think correctly made that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.720
 released such a ruler herr factor 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.130
 because it is a very unusual line 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.650
 due to the fact that 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.900
 This picture can be collected various 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.470
 I personally have variations with similar robot 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 all robots from this collection are following 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.450
 video I will tell you them 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.660
 support my channel subscribe to 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.540
 new videos and like everybody until 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:56.339
 new meetings 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:56.339
 [music] 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.980
 exactly 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980
 [music]
