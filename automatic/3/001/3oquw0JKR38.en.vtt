response of cortisol is associated with
more<00:05:02.550> muscles<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.720> would<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:03.990> really<00:05:04.380> silly

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
more muscles so it would be really silly

to try to take something to lower it and
the<00:05:06.450> reality<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:06.990> if<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.410> could<00:05:07.710> take

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
the reality is if you could take

the reality is if you could take

something to lower it and you learn the

a style of working out or a diet they
