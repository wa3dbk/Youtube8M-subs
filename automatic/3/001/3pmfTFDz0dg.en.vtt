is just a small 5 by 7 canvas and I'm

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
is just a small 5 by 7 canvas and I'm
going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> paint<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.899> gesso<00:00:40.320> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going to paint it first with gesso this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.530 
going to paint it first with gesso this
is<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> create<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:42.090> nice<00:00:42.210> surface

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
is going to create a really nice surface

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.470 
is going to create a really nice surface
to<00:00:42.719> work<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.579> non-porous<00:00:45.030> surface

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to work on it's a non-porous surface

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
to work on it's a non-porous surface
once<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> gesso<00:00:46.200> dries<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.129> add<00:00:47.280> our

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
once that gesso dries so when we add our

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.209 
once that gesso dries so when we add our
gelatos<00:00:48.000> they'll<00:00:48.629> glide<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.590> blend

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
gelatos they'll glide and blend

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
gelatos they'll glide and blend
beautifully<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> apply

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
dry this between each step and when

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
dry this between each step and when
using<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> gesso<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.199> did<00:01:01.379> dry<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.800> my

blends the gelatos beautifully so the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.290 
blends the gelatos beautifully so the
gelatos<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.890> water<00:02:13.890> soluble<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> can

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
gelatos are water soluble but you can

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.610

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
piece so now once that first layer of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.020 
piece so now once that first layer of
glaze<00:03:45.690> dried<00:03:46.260> I'm<00:03:46.710> going<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.100> go<00:03:47.220> back<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.910> I'm

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
glaze dried I'm going to go back and I'm

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.790 
glaze dried I'm going to go back and I'm
going<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.300> put<00:03:48.510> another<00:03:48.780> layer<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.320> top<00:03:49.560> and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
going to put another layer on top and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.620 
going to put another layer on top and
what's<00:03:49.920> nice<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.400> can<00:03:50.640> see<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:50.880> once

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
what's nice is you can see that once

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.990 
what's nice is you can see that once
that<00:03:51.870> first<00:03:52.140> layer<00:03:52.470> dried<00:03:53.010> when<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:53.550> add<00:03:53.820> this

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that first layer dried when I add this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.840 
that first layer dried when I add this
other<00:03:54.210> layer<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:55.110> gelatos<00:03:55.650> are<00:03:55.980> not<00:03:56.430> blending

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
other layer the gelatos are not blending

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.790 
other layer the gelatos are not blending
any<00:03:56.970> longer<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:57.990> just<00:03:58.140> sealing<00:03:58.470> in

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
any longer so this is just sealing in

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.310 
any longer so this is just sealing in
that<00:03:58.980> glitter<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.370> adding<00:03:59.850> even<00:04:00.030> more<00:04:00.320> shine

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
that glitter and adding even more shine

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:12.570 
that glitter and adding even more shine
to<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.740> project

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.850 

and<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:13.480> want<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.810> sure<00:04:13.990> this<00:04:14.140> got

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
and then I just want to be sure this got

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.560 
and then I just want to be sure this got
too<00:04:15.040> much<00:04:15.190> pulled<00:04:15.580> up<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.970> sides<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.480> then

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
too much pulled up on the sides and then

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.530 
too much pulled up on the sides and then
I'll<00:04:16.720> let<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:16.870> dry<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:18.459> finish<00:04:18.820> off<00:04:19.030> this

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
I'll let it dry and to finish off this

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.449 
I'll let it dry and to finish off this
