00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:03.532
Let's go to the second game of the night!

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:09.370
It's the "Sentence Game". They will
pick sentences that you wrote.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.955
Two players begin, let's go
with Elidio and Daniel.

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:20.192
They will have two sentences each,
and will keep them in their pockets.

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:26.391
They will make a scene and will use
the sentences when they feel like it.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.004
In the coolest time to use them. They
have never seen these sentences,

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.222
they will keep them in their pockets
and will use them in the scene.

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:37.888
Someone from the right side,
give me a place.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.243
Desert. Good.

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:44.690
Desert is great.
I like it.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.893
People from the middle, what
are they doing in the desert?

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:55.488
They are looking for gold.
In the desert. Very well.

00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:59.320
Never saw that...
But that's okay. Let's go.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.785
Looking for gold in the desert,
"Sentence Game", go!

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:06.485
Come on! Dig!

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:10.169
Oh, Emperor!

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:14.114
I can't take it anymore!

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.587
I didn't tell you to stop!

00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:23.462
Keep going! I'm sure
there is gold in the desert!

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.888
I found... I found
something, emperor.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.756
Let me see! Let me see!

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.501
That's exactly what I was looking for!

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.347
It's the statue written:

00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:47.702
"São Paulo fans aren't faggots."

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.187
With this statue, we're gonna be rich!

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:08.698
But keep digging!

00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:12.859
While I look at my statue.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.003
Sir...

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:24.550
Campos do Jordão
is Brazil's highest city.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:38.609
I think we should take the statue
there, so everyone can see it.

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:49.470
You know, it's a fine idea,
coming from a subject like you.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:54.072
Let's go to Campos do Jordão!

00:02:55.273 --> 00:02:58.576
"At Campos do Jordão..."

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.059
Cool weather here, huh?

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.483
I'm a little cold. Who
will receive this statue?

00:03:06.483 --> 00:03:09.720
Oh! There's the man who
will receive the statue!

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:13.227
"Statue receiver."

00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:16.325
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:20.791
In the name of the desert creatures...

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:23.631
I come here...

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:28.219
To eat some meat,
because it's very good!

00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:34.864
And also to deliver the statue

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:38.326
of São Paulo fans not being a bunch of fags.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:41.482
That doesn't exist!

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:50.312
Gimme a break, right?

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:54.681
Just read what's written there!

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:57.897
This is a cheap copy.
Really cheap!

00:03:57.897 --> 00:04:00.653
Want some meat?

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.574
I've wasted the trip already...

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.571
Typical north-eastern food!

00:04:08.183 --> 00:04:11.752
From Campos do Jordão!

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.808
I was in the desert. It will
be interesting to eat this.

00:04:14.808 --> 00:04:17.325
- And there's more!
- What?

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:21.854
I'm sure I know you
from somewhere...

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.365
Oh, yeah?

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:36.333
Perhaps...

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.992
From Sahara?

00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:42.253
I was there.

00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:44.177
Once.

00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:47.571
You're the one who stole my camel!

00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:50.917
O-Of course I didn't!

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:54.505
What would I do with a... Camel?

00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:57.245
"Camel Escondidinho."

00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:11.739
It's delicious, okay?
If you never had it...

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:16.299
I didn't really like it.
It didn't taste so good...

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.778
This escondidinho comes like this...

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.779
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
