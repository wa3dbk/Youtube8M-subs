my<00:00:56.260> intention<00:00:56.680> was<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.830> find<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.160> container

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
my intention was to find a container

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.040 
my intention was to find a container
with<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.790> small<00:00:58.030> opening<00:00:58.060> but<00:00:58.660> they<00:00:58.780> couldn't

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
with a small opening but they couldn't

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.310 
with a small opening but they couldn't
tip<00:00:59.140> over<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.730> way<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:00.880> could<00:01:01.170> throw<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
tip over that way I could throw the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.600 
tip over that way I could throw the
mealworms<00:01:02.680> in<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.920> cage<00:01:03.100> without<00:01:03.310> them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610
