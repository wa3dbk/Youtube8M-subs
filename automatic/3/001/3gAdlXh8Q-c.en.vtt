in other parts of the world that would

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
in other parts of the world that would

certainly not be considered to be a
crisis<00:01:06.960> situation<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.970> even

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
crisis situation so I think that even

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
crisis situation so I think that even
though<00:01:09.510> year-over-year<00:01:10.260> obviously<00:01:11.010> their

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
though year-over-year obviously their

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.800 
though year-over-year obviously their
swings<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:13.100> affecting<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> us<00:01:14.810> for

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
swings that are affecting all of us for

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
swings that are affecting all of us for
us<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> matter<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> competing<00:01:17.159> within<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
us it's a matter of competing within the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
us it's a matter of competing within the
existing<00:01:18.000> markets<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.780> such<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
existing markets in such a way that we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.740 
existing markets in such a way that we
grab<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> bigger<00:01:20.310> share<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.970> market<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
grab a bigger share of that market and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.969 
grab a bigger share of that market and
that's<00:01:22.080> where<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> will

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that's where I think that it will

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's where I think that it will
separate<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:23.880> brands<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.780> less

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
separate the good brands from the less

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
separate the good brands from the less
strong<00:01:25.439> brands<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.549> why<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.270> see

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
strong brands and that's why we we see

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
strong brands and that's why we we see
that<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.720> overall<00:01:28.200> terms<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.860> exciting

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that in overall terms these are exciting

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
that in overall terms these are exciting
days<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.240> long<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> write

thing that the downturn that we've had

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.230 
thing that the downturn that we've had
growth<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:40.790> it's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> chance<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
growth so long that it's a chance to

stronger brands come out when there is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
an upturn Lina well i think that there's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
an upturn Lina well i think that there's
many<00:01:51.509> opportunities<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.439> could<00:01:52.710> look

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
many opportunities that you could look

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
many opportunities that you could look
at<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.549> goes<00:01:54.060> without<00:01:54.270> saying<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.930> these

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
at it it goes without saying that these

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
at it it goes without saying that these
type<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> situations<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> first

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
type of situations we've seen it coming

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.930 
type of situations we've seen it coming
a<00:02:09.650> little<00:02:09.770> bit<00:02:09.979> earlier<00:02:10.310> than<00:02:10.460> most<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.850> our

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
a little bit earlier than most of our

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.210 
a little bit earlier than most of our
competitors<00:02:11.000> did<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.110> Gaza<00:02:12.380> gave<00:02:12.980> us<00:02:13.190> a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
competitors did and that Gaza gave us a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040 
competitors did and that Gaza gave us a
heads<00:02:13.520> up<00:02:13.730> both<00:02:13.970> from<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.300> revenue<00:02:14.510> point<00:02:14.960> of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
heads up both from a revenue point of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.290 
heads up both from a revenue point of
view<00:02:15.170> as<00:02:15.320> well<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.650> from<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.980> cost<00:02:16.610> contingency

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
view as well as from a cost contingency

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.450 
view as well as from a cost contingency
point<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.690> view<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.500> think<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.830> indeed<00:02:19.280> it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
point of view so I think that indeed it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.370 
point of view so I think that indeed it
does<00:02:19.640> create<00:02:19.970> opportunities<00:02:20.750> for<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.110> branch

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
does create opportunities for the branch

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.570 
does create opportunities for the branch
and<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.370> will<00:02:22.610> separate<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.210> those<00:02:24.550> what<00:02:25.550> i

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and it will separate out those what i

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940 
and it will separate out those what i
would<00:02:25.880> call<00:02:26.120> players<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.350> market<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
would call players in the market that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.680 
would call players in the market that
thought<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.610> running<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.150> hotel<00:02:29.330> is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
thought that running a hotel is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.200 
thought that running a hotel is
something<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.380> as<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> hobby<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
something that you do as a hobby and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.730 
something that you do as a hobby and
separate<00:02:32.210> them<00:02:32.360> out<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:33.110> sense<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.560> they

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
separate them out in a sense that they

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.040 
separate them out in a sense that they
will<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.430> able<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.730> survive<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
will not be able to survive in the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
will not be able to survive in the
tougher<00:02:36.320> conditions<00:02:36.500> where<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.580> actually

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
tougher conditions where we actually

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.240 
tougher conditions where we actually
like<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.750> because<00:02:39.200> competition<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.100> that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
like that because competition in that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
like that because competition in that

somewhere<00:03:34.190> like<00:03:34.370> 20<00:03:34.760> hotels<00:03:35.860> over<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.980> next

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
somewhere like 20 hotels over the next

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.890 
somewhere like 20 hotels over the next
two<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.610> three<00:03:37.640> years<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.300> will<00:03:38.480> double<00:03:38.870> to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
two to three years that will double to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.820 
two to three years that will double to
40<00:03:39.860> 45<00:03:40.370> hotels<00:03:40.670> only<00:03:41.510> global<00:03:41.690> scale<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
40 45 hotels only global scale so it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.949 
40 45 hotels only global scale so it
becomes<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.280> brand<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.700> serious<00:03:44.030> substance<00:03:44.390> and

becomes a brand of serious substance and

becomes a brand of serious substance and
many<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.440> those<00:03:45.530> will<00:03:45.769> be<00:03:45.890> in<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.010> Middle<00:03:46.250> East

it's<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.120> bit<00:03:53.269> opportunistic<00:03:53.900> we<00:03:54.830> have<00:03:54.950> been

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
it's a bit opportunistic we have been

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's a bit opportunistic we have been
working<00:03:55.459> together<00:03:55.610> with<00:03:55.940> many<00:03:56.120> partners<00:03:56.480> in

working together with many partners in
many

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
many

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.459 
many
different<00:03:57.700> places<00:03:57.939> where<00:03:58.329> basically<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.439> have

00:03:59.459 --> 00:03:59.469 
different places where basically we have

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.589 
different places where basically we have
been<00:03:59.769> trying<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.459> compete<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:01.000> get<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.359> first

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
been trying to compete to get the first

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.720 
been trying to compete to get the first
one<00:04:01.750> open<00:04:02.200> initially<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.250> thought<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.609> was

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
one open initially we thought it was

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.699 
one open initially we thought it was
going<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.030> be<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.390> Barcelona<00:04:04.989> then<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.530> was

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
going to be in Barcelona then it was

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.640 
going to be in Barcelona then it was
Istanbul<00:04:06.280> then<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.299> was<00:04:07.450> Doha<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.079> basically

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
Istanbul then it was Doha so basically

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890 
Istanbul then it was Doha so basically
they<00:04:08.799> came<00:04:09.040> up<00:04:09.069> more<00:04:09.459> or<00:04:09.579> less<00:04:09.730> or<00:04:09.909> similar

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
they came up more or less or similar

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.259 
they came up more or less or similar
timings<00:04:11.379> so<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.400> fact<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:12.700> though<00:04:12.939> I<00:04:12.969> was

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
timings so the fact that though I was

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.879 
timings so the fact that though I was
the<00:04:13.420> first<00:04:13.689> it's<00:04:14.139> exciting<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.650> us<00:04:14.799> because

morning and the hospitality industry I

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.400 
morning and the hospitality industry I
think<00:05:56.850> that<00:05:56.910> hospitality<00:05:57.750> industry<00:05:58.199> in

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
think that hospitality industry in

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.800 
think that hospitality industry in
itself<00:05:58.770> is<00:05:59.039> an<00:05:59.400> industry<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.120> over<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:00.630> long

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
itself is an industry that over the long

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.439 
itself is an industry that over the long
run<00:06:00.870> can<00:06:01.350> only<00:06:01.530> go<00:06:01.800> up<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:02.190> think<00:06:03.000> that<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.300> has

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
run can only go up I think that it has

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.150 
run can only go up I think that it has
the<00:06:03.600> potential<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.110> become<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.650> number<00:06:05.130> one

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
the potential to become the number one

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.670 
the potential to become the number one
industry<00:06:05.610> in<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:05.940> world<00:06:05.970> actually<00:06:06.600> with<00:06:07.289> with

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
industry in the world actually with with

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.590 
industry in the world actually with with
more<00:06:07.889> people<00:06:08.250> traveling<00:06:08.699> with<00:06:09.030> more<00:06:09.240> people

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
more people traveling with more people

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.990 
more people traveling with more people
having<00:06:09.870> access<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.320> travel<00:06:10.830> with<00:06:11.460> prices

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
having access to travel with prices

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.700 
having access to travel with prices
being<00:06:12.180> more<00:06:12.479> reasonable<00:06:13.139> with<00:06:13.620> the

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
being more reasonable with the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.830 
being more reasonable with the
communication<00:06:14.430> tools<00:06:14.699> being<00:06:15.000> more<00:06:15.300> open<00:06:15.330> and

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
communication tools being more open and

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.719 
communication tools being more open and
therefore<00:06:16.320> even<00:06:16.740> easier<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.550> communicate

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
therefore even easier to communicate

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.689 
therefore even easier to communicate
with<00:06:18.120> larger<00:06:18.630> group<00:06:19.190> people<00:06:20.190> will<00:06:20.340> have<00:06:20.490> more

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
with larger group people will have more

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.159 
with larger group people will have more
time<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.150> travel<00:06:21.389> and<00:06:21.599> more<00:06:21.780> money<00:06:21.990> and

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
time to travel and more money and

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.560 
time to travel and more money and
there's<00:06:22.560> nothing<00:06:22.889> new<00:06:23.070> in<00:06:23.099> that<00:06:23.310> even<00:06:24.120> with<00:06:24.300> a

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
there's nothing new in that even with a

to call it over time the hotel industry

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.430 
to call it over time the hotel industry
the<00:06:29.340> travel<00:06:29.729> industry<00:06:29.880> as<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.360> whole<00:06:30.539> is<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:31.169> good

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
the travel industry as a whole is a good

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.350 
the travel industry as a whole is a good
business<00:06:31.650> to<00:06:31.860> be<00:06:31.979> in<00:06:32.130> so<00:06:32.490> I<00:06:32.699> see<00:06:33.120> it<00:06:33.240> very

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
business to be in so I see it very

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.689 
business to be in so I see it very
positive<00:06:33.960> how<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:34.680> hotels<00:06:35.190> are<00:06:35.370> going<00:06:35.610> to

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
positive how the hotels are going to

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.700 
positive how the hotels are going to
look<00:06:35.849> in<00:06:36.030> 20<00:06:36.389> years<00:06:36.509> from<00:06:36.720> now<00:06:36.810> it's<00:06:37.169> difficult

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
look in 20 years from now it's difficult

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.999 
look in 20 years from now it's difficult
to<00:06:38.460> describe<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:39.210> think<00:06:39.449> a<00:06:39.660> part<00:06:40.020> component

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
to describe I think a part component

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.710 
to describe I think a part component
will<00:06:41.130> be<00:06:41.280> actually<00:06:41.460> pretty<00:06:41.910> similar<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.570> what

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
will be actually pretty similar to what

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.749 
will be actually pretty similar to what
we<00:06:42.870> see<00:06:43.050> today<00:06:43.280> because<00:06:44.280> people<00:06:44.610> will

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
we see today because people will

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.020 
we see today because people will
continue<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.479> like<00:06:45.780> that<00:06:46.080> type<00:06:46.530> of<00:06:46.560> hotels<00:06:47.490> but

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
continue to like that type of hotels but

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.730 
continue to like that type of hotels but
there<00:06:48.150> will<00:06:48.270> also<00:06:48.389> be<00:06:48.509> a<00:06:48.630> number<00:06:49.169> of<00:06:49.320> very

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
there will also be a number of very

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.850 
there will also be a number of very
