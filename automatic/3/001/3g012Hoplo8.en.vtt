00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 John Sina's stories to the router with me where 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.740
 mvp paper and william rigal organized 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.379
 grouping was very interesting 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.480
 fascinating story yet to say 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.780
 principle affected opinion also 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.819
 of your created star now you could 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.760
 increase his overall strength 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.610

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.989
 could do earlier in season musudan 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.930
 Version 1081 is in the mouth of Russia I do not have 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.459
 there are places for consciously super stars 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 for those six stars no cream 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.290
 no ratings no hostility 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.730
 just pick a title and follow it 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.620
 after a few matches 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.140
 become the number one contender 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.220
 nothing interesting was playing this is not really 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.859
 I liked it and so I can beat iron there 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.260
 50's 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.180
 general gameplay is not particularly affected 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:05.739
 changes that is, in principle, too 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 most but removed let's say a fight among 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.910
 viewers removed game mode removed 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 title creation but added interesting 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.660
 router with skill added created finish 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.169
 when creating the finisher it was debut a 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.690
 also added a highlight reel 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.440
 creating videos that could 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.209
 spread to the north and all the rest 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.310
 could play with them now you can 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.319
 see 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.139
 creating your character innovation 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.799
 It was such that now tattoos on 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:45.609
 your character was visible in the online game 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.950
 and also this is a game in which sundown was going 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:52.450
 the first part of the game that behaved 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.120
 it was possible to talk already during 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.500
 match online that is on playstation 3 and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.169
 on x-box 360 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.290
 here it is now see highlight reel then 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.530
 That debuted in this not but sense from 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.280
 it was not enough for other Greece, and already 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.180
 the following parts could have been given 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.799
 videos are created to put on the whale throne 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.359
 your special character video in general 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.780
 we can say that the game is pretty 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.880
 quite a bit of special change as i said 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.340
 she did not touch me but even on schedule 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.980
 I can say that for me 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.520
 everything is not so cartoon looks like in ww 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.520
 ii 13 though tried to make a schedule 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.320
 x-man realistically here is 3 finisher what 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.919
 debuted many were pleased data 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.130
 functions 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.530
 that you can create your finisher 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.160
 animations to create your signature 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.080
 reception was presented more than 500 and then 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.070
 there were more than 500 animation 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.190
 spout keys so we were told in heat 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.729
 that time and I personally did not check already very 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.889
 not too lazy to think I think all the data 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.270
 used the chip and now use 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.220
 in ww ii 13 let quite such 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:13.910
 innovations about the amber match was 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.520
 not bad either, but we removed the match in return 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.550
 string that is the share of the sword deloit 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.070
 removed the match where possible among the spectators 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.380
 fight but amber urine don't know cost 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.919
 1 addition 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.080
 also in the roster now we could 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.150
 increase or decrease the strength of someone 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.370
 that the same they were not available 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.729
 previous parts but the game was based 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.300
 on all the same team tricks about such 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.910
 there was no well and by the way pretty 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.740
 cool now for this ww 13 nobody has 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.300
 principle does not pay attention to that 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.900
 it was a moment of sharing 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.840
 innovations many who have been able after 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.090
 announced 1008 came on 2009 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.539
 They said that in principle it is not really you 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.060
 I have changed a lot and I used to fight like that 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.669
 and before that they captured and all one 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.440
 and the same only inferno literature 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.530
 doubts how big such 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.940
 innovations and team captures 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.410
 Basically, this is all if you want to continue 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.139

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.349
