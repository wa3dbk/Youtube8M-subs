on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> filter<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.140> use<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> small<00:02:04.680> hand<00:02:05.070> pump

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
on the filter and use a small hand pump

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.920 
on the filter and use a small hand pump
to<00:02:05.490> backwash<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.180> when<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> needs<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> be

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to backwash it when it needs to be

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.160 
to backwash it when it needs to be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
cleaned out it is a drip filter so it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.589 
cleaned out it is a drip filter so it
doesn't<00:02:10.470> work<00:02:10.649> fast<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.150> type<00:02:12.390> of

it's<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.190> simple<00:02:27.490> setup<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.590> drilled<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
it's a very simple setup I drilled a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.770 
it's a very simple setup I drilled a
small<00:02:29.709> hole<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.400> tank<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:31.000> holds<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
small hole in the tank that holds the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.630 
small hole in the tank that holds the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.550 
source water from there the water
travels<00:02:34.150> through<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.390> flexible<00:02:34.720> hose<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.470> the

flows<00:02:39.220> through<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.610> filter<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.300> drips<00:02:40.660> it
