scramble<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.200> position<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.290> changed<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.520> one

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
scramble the position is changed so one

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.649 
scramble the position is changed so one
two<00:01:24.540> three<00:01:24.840> four<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> order<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.670> different

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
two three four so the order is different

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
two three four so the order is different
so<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.259> will<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:28.770> difficult<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.640> others

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so it will be very difficult for others

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
so it will be very difficult for others
too

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.780 

hack<00:01:33.820> your<00:01:34.090> device<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.720> if<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.229> try<00:01:35.500> again<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
hack your device so if I try again that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.920 
hack your device so if I try again that
number<00:01:37.090> pad<00:01:37.479> will<00:01:37.630> be<00:01:37.830> changed<00:01:38.830> again<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.930> 123

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
number pad will be changed again so 123

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.690 
number pad will be changed again so 123
for<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.350> position<00:01:41.530> will<00:01:41.830> be<00:01:41.860> changed<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:42.340> it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
for this position will be changed so it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.660 
for this position will be changed so it
gives<00:01:42.970> an<00:01:43.119> extra<00:01:43.360> security<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.920> phone<00:01:45.400> and
