00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.380 
how to tie ourselves and make time
family<00:01:58.290> everybody<00:01:58.680> else<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.850> same<00:02:00.030> time

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
family everybody else at the same time

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
family everybody else at the same time
then<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.960> probably<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.920> done<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
then we probably can get more done so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
then we probably can get more done so
that's<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.930> should<00:02:04.079> probably<00:02:04.259> start

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that's what we should probably start

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
that's what we should probably start
doing<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.130> titled<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> planning<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.810> our

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
because I think that especially as for

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.490 
because I think that especially as for
women<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.540> harder<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.050> us<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.200> lose

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
women is kind of harder for us to lose

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.230 
women is kind of harder for us to lose
