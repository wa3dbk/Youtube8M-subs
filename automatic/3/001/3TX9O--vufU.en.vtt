your computer is how fast your computer

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.320 
your computer is how fast your computer
is<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:12.250> start<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> process<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.090> walk

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
is so just start the process and walk

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.920 
is so just start the process and walk
away<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.260> you'll<00:03:14.410> see<00:03:14.560> down<00:03:14.680> here<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
away and you'll see down here you have a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.330 
away and you'll see down here you have a
percentage<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.019> where<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.130> process

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
percentage of where it is in the process

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.729 
percentage of where it is in the process
so<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.570> keep<00:03:19.690> an<00:03:19.810> eye<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
so you can keep an eye on that but I the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.259 
so you can keep an eye on that but I the
best<00:03:21.160> idea<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.700> kind<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.880> start<00:03:22.090> this

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
best idea is to kind of start this

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.420 
best idea is to kind of start this
