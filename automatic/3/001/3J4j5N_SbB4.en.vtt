the<00:02:13.420> man<00:02:13.720> up<00:02:13.930> roll<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.510> no<00:02:16.510> longer<00:02:16.690> will<00:02:16.900> they

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the man up roll so no longer will they

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
that so you want two people well to bots

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380 
that so you want two people well to bots
on<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.260> other<00:02:26.410> team<00:02:26.680> strictly<00:02:27.370> because<00:02:27.520> when

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
on the other team strictly because when

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
on the other team strictly because when
time<00:02:28.600> runs<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:28.989> they'll<00:02:29.260> automatically<00:02:29.770> win

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
time runs out they'll automatically win

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.190 
time runs out they'll automatically win
because<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.520> more<00:02:30.730> players<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
because they have more players so it

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
because they have more players so it
keeps<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.590> games<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.580> don't

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
keeps the games going and you don't

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.890 
keeps the games going and you don't
really<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.330> anything<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.150> I'm

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.420 

basically<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.830> would<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.310> would

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
