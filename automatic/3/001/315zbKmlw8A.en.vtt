 not only steel is not so fresh here 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.289
 much less were able to move down at the first Grand Prix 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:19.380
 Porsche in the shack the largest port in the world there is a whole fleet 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.849

 Steffen stranded sailors traveled to cheer a German team 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.880
 a ship in the north 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.000
 one of many that has been sitting in front of Singapore for months 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.560

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.850
 crisis learns the world trade sailors 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 are caught again 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.700
 I came in October in this high phase where the ships are here 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.100
 the port looked highly loaded with and taylor-ann 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.720
 and have been waiting until finally the place in the port 2 will be 11 and have mistakes 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.210
 and percent you do not get enough capacity on ships 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.440
 could go now five euros here is from the shipyard but out and put 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.650

 the German sailor yarn Christian Schmidt is the contact to the world for 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.610
 the team 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.979
 which came on the container ship why Aigner is trapped since September 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.460
 the Russian captain melt about ten men crew 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.650
 have not been this year for months is brown for Europe but not only 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
 the missing money makes them Kurt Wagner 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.270
 that is in the show Willi in between, it was really dangerous we have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.400
 not a single drop of oil on board any electricity 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 nothing at all Rosel Staudte 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.800
 the hectic laser op 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.440
 which Homburg 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.530
 how well the ship lay completely in the dark was not possible here in the galley 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.760
 coffee no more drinking water the toilets worked average percent 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.069
 Roberto here was stranded on an island 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 that rose today 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.129
 only one of many ships with the same fate is the Karl Arco 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.159
 Meyer 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.499
 their owners far away in the Netherlands Antilles 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.589
 they let the crew hang 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.589
 at anchor 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.880
 No more Magnin foul my lesson learned opinion 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.250
 Bollermann Lohan has no more money for my family in the Philippines 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:40.699
 Checkout, please, I can not transfer this year as before would need 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.359
 my kids are taking the school fees in single family homes right now 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.199
 what will he say at least let's go out here for a bit of fun 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.949
 to have since 4 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.959
 he referred to the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.570
 one of her colleagues is already done 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.570
 had to be admitted to psychiatry in Singapore 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.839
 Pastor Schmidt is for the men to talk to pray for who it 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.899
 He wants to have phone cards but also newspapers with bad ones 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.239
 news 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.149
 undignified is you know this sailor bus 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.149
 Pirates have captured him 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.249
 It is not the best time for shipping at the moment 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.289
 Captain Sergei, the Mandarin has grown small plants in kernels 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.769
 Recipe against boredom 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.510
 the crew lays the ship to deal with and that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.879
 maybe someone buys 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.659
 the International Maritime Workers' Union left the Karbener around one meanwhile 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.099
 to the chain 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.919
 a sign of hope for the crew because now the ship could 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.109
 sold 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.109
 From the proceeds, the team would finally get their reward 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.149
 but who buys a container ship when the business is lying fallow? 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.109
 the Port Authority of Singapore is again supplying oil and electricity 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.519
 May the ship pass another day 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.519
 In the meantime they are counting eggs on the Karbener 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.810
 Picture apples are hanging 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.659
 I say mine 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.979
 Men are always the harvest and sailors 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.109
 and hope dies last 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.219
 because what would have to be advertising 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.699
 only when the world economy should build oceans I can finally 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.699
 So losing my job gives away lots of pressure 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.729
 Gallows humor on top of the bridge 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.729
 and down in the galley there are new problems 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.539
 The cook tells Pastor Schmidt that the supplies are coming to an end 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.909
 angry is no longer a hostage to the crisis 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.300
 he is "It's normal 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.930
 That's not normal 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.630
 if you work you should get paid every month v if i have my money 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.849
 and a ticket home, this ship never sees me again w 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.719
 I'm doing it for today 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:03.490
 Al Baker but no good or in the hotel safe even if it is here 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.689
 there is a price set for the ship, says the captain 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.839
 there is an interested party 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.319
 and the boss Jack has revealed that the BKA, according to Meyer from the best are in good shape 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.719
 Cicek resulting 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.659
 It looks like the freighter could pay $ 8 million for two 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:20.930
 Change owner 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.200
 then finally would have to wait months before Singapore for the team 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.919
 an end 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.919
 Sailor Pfarrer Schmidt leaves the ship 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.919
 he drives over to the next game 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.539
 there are also desperate sailors whom he supports 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:44.559
 getting the interior shots done is always putting her on sale 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.580
 what is actually life of the sailors 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.340
 Percent if I have now but ships I have visited several times now 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.969
 the Cooper Care 11 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.969
 People are increasingly on both stars 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.650
 claustrophobic symptoms show so 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.349
 No 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.469
 where you can not say anymore it gets on the nerves it goes to the substance 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.319
 but where you really are still scared and these people have to look at it like that 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.830
 Cushions with the states answers most can not cope 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.869
 a sailor comes on the esperanza has called Pastor Schmidt for help 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.629
 Another freighter who limps in front of him without orders for weeks 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:29.369
 but the states on this ship only gets Schmidt to see ours 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.379
 Camera is not allowed at the word
