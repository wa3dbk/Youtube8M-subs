00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
today I'm going to be making my first

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.669 
today I'm going to be making my first
Rubik's<00:00:07.620> Cube<00:00:07.980> video<00:00:08.370> um<00:00:08.960> as<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.019> can<00:00:10.500> see<00:00:10.620> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
Rubik's Cube video um as you can see it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.220 
Rubik's Cube video um as you can see it
will<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> four<00:00:11.309> by<00:00:11.460> four<00:00:11.929> and<00:00:12.929> today

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
will be in the four by four and today

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.799 
will be in the four by four and today
i'll<00:00:13.320> be<00:00:13.380> showing<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> checkerboard

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
i'll be showing you how to checkerboard

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
i'll be showing you how to checkerboard
so<00:00:15.809> let's<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.139> right<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.560> point<00:00:16.789> first

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
so let's get right to the point first

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.429 
so let's get right to the point first
off<00:00:18.029> I'll<00:00:18.270> show<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.840> three<00:00:19.050> by<00:00:19.199> three

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
off I'll show you the three by three

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
off I'll show you the three by three
checkerboard<00:00:20.039> which<00:00:20.340> doesn't<00:00:20.699> look<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:20.970> cool

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
checkerboard which doesn't look as cool

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
checkerboard which doesn't look as cool
on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> four<00:00:21.600> by<00:00:21.779> four<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.560> still<00:00:22.769> do

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
on the four by four but you can still do

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.310 
on the four by four but you can still do
it<00:00:23.100> anyway<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.029> you're<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> turn<00:00:24.720> every

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it anyway so you're going to turn every

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
it anyway so you're going to turn every
side<00:00:25.560> twice<00:00:25.800> pretty<00:00:26.130> much<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.730> left<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:32.090> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
side twice pretty much right left so and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
side twice pretty much right left so and
you<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:35.120> odd<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.180> pattern<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.680> now

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you have this odd little pattern so now

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.180 
you have this odd little pattern so now
you're<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.100> I'm

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you're just going to and then so now I'm

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
you're just going to and then so now I'm
going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> show<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> 4

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going to show you how to do it on the 4

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
going to show you how to do it on the 4
by<00:00:48.629> 4<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.320> looks<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.070> cooler<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> do

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
by 4 which looks a lot cooler if you do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
by 4 which looks a lot cooler if you do
it<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> basically<00:00:52.980> what

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it the right way so basically what

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.470 
it the right way so basically what
you're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> you're<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.369 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:00:55.910> any<00:00:56.910> side<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.510> usually<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
take any side I usually do it on the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
take any side I usually do it on the
orange<00:00:58.770> face<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.149> yellow<00:01:00.329> face<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.809> top

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
orange face and the yellow face on top

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
orange face and the yellow face on top
so<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> follow<00:01:02.550> along<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:03.180> ahead

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so if you want to follow along go ahead

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
so if you want to follow along go ahead
set<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.260> four<00:01:04.470> by<00:01:04.589> four<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
set up your four by four like that and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
set up your four by four like that and
you're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> turn<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.750> side<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you're going to turn the right side to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330 
you're going to turn the right side to
right<00:01:07.860> side<00:01:08.189> twice<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:10.040> you're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
right side twice and you're going to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.179 
right side twice and you're going to
turn<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> tube<00:01:11.880> top<00:01:12.090> sides<00:01:12.390> twice<00:01:13.189> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
turn the tube top sides twice then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
turn the tube top sides twice then
you're<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> turn<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.180> backsides

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you're going to turn the two backsides

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320 
you're going to turn the two backsides
twice<00:01:16.369> then<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> throw<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> two

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
twice then you're going to throw the two

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.840 
twice then you're going to throw the two
types<00:01:18.630> eyes<00:01:18.869> again<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> should<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
types eyes again and now you should have

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.679 
types eyes again and now you should have
a<00:01:21.360> pattern<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.590> squares<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.479> every<00:01:24.479> side

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a pattern of four squares on every side

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.109 
a pattern of four squares on every side
so<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.590> don't<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.250> pattern<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:26.880> back

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
so you don't have this pattern go back

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
so you don't have this pattern go back
and<00:01:27.860> check<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.070> sure<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.700> did

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and check to make sure you did

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.899 
and check to make sure you did
everything<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:31.159> you're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> do

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
everything right now you're going to do

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.130 
everything right now you're going to do
just<00:01:33.320> similar<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> top<00:01:35.970> layer<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
just similar so do the top layer the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.969 
just similar so do the top layer the
bottom<00:01:37.530> layer<00:01:38.270> front<00:01:39.270> layer<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.520> layer

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
bottom layer front layer the back layer

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.749 
bottom layer front layer the back layer
the<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.280> player<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.689> left<00:01:45.960> player<00:01:46.759> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the right player the left player and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.780 
the right player the left player and
there<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.549> now

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
there you go so as you can see we now

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
there you go so as you can see we now
have<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.659> checkerboard<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.590> all<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.100> our

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have this checkerboard on all of our

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.639 
have this checkerboard on all of our
sides<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:54.270> form<00:01:54.570> our<00:01:54.689> size<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
sides well form our size and then on the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
sides well form our size and then on the
other<00:01:55.680> two<00:01:56.070> sides<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.450> normal<00:01:57.810> three<00:01:58.020> by

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
other two sides is the normal three by

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
other two sides is the normal three by
three<00:01:58.380> Rubik's<00:01:58.799> Cube<00:01:59.100> checkerboard<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
three Rubik's Cube checkerboard and so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.429 
three Rubik's Cube checkerboard and so
now<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> solve<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.770> fairly<00:02:02.729> easy<00:02:03.439> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
now to solve it it's fairly easy you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
now to solve it it's fairly easy you
just<00:02:04.500> reverse<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just reverse it and so you're going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.820 
just reverse it and so you're going to
do<00:02:08.479> front<00:02:09.479> twice

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
do front twice

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.430 
do front twice
