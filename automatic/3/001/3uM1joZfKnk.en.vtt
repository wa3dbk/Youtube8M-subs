00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
when I started lifting my dominant body

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.270 
when I started lifting my dominant body
plus<00:01:44.350> with<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.530> ones<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.829> was<00:01:44.950> doing<00:01:45.130> hold

plus with the ones that I was doing hold
in<00:01:45.579> all<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.939> time<00:01:46.119> so<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.299> became<00:01:46.689> dominant

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
in all the time so that became dominant

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.020 
in all the time so that became dominant
cuz<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.259> was<00:01:47.380> doing<00:01:47.530> them<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.490> my<00:01:48.820> body

when<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.700> started<00:01:57.909> training<00:01:58.090> back<00:01:58.390> my<00:01:58.960> back

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
when I started training back my back

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.139 
when I started training back my back
wouldn't<00:01:59.439> even<00:01:59.619> fire<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.310> my<00:02:00.700> passes<00:02:01.030> will

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
wouldn't even fire like my passes will

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.090 
wouldn't even fire like my passes will
immediately<00:02:01.509> get<00:02:01.869> pumped<00:02:02.259> filled<00:02:02.770> with<00:02:02.920> blood

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
immediately get pumped filled with blood

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.539 
immediately get pumped filled with blood
my<00:02:03.369> body<00:02:03.820> will<00:02:04.060> immediately<00:02:04.780> use<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.100> muscles

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
my body will immediately use the muscles

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.999 
my body will immediately use the muscles
that<00:02:06.640> are<00:02:06.700> conditioned<00:02:07.299> its<00:02:07.450> use<00:02:07.800> same<00:02:08.800> thing

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
that are conditioned its use same thing

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.950 
that are conditioned its use same thing
with<00:02:09.190> all<00:02:09.729> my<00:02:09.970> other<00:02:10.000> lagging<00:02:10.450> body<00:02:10.570> parts

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
with all my other lagging body parts

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.020 
with all my other lagging body parts
when<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.080> wanted<00:02:11.380> them<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.590> become<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.700> improve

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
when I wanted them to become to improve

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.000 
when I wanted them to become to improve
that's<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.840> only<00:02:13.900> training<00:02:14.200> first<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.860> more

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
that's not only training first but more

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.310 
that's not only training first but more
efficient<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.580> mean<00:02:15.730> most<00:02:15.910> more<00:02:16.150> frequently<00:02:16.600> so

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
efficient I mean most more frequently so

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.680 
efficient I mean most more frequently so
one<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.370> achieve<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.300> like<00:02:19.600> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
one way to achieve that is to like I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.770 
one way to achieve that is to like I
said<00:02:20.640> train<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> first<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.210> routine<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
said train it first in your routine and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.780 
said train it first in your routine and
don't<00:02:23.500> really<00:02:23.710> focus<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.130> heavy<00:02:24.280> weight<00:02:24.520> right

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
don't really focus on heavy weight right

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.759 
don't really focus on heavy weight right
if<00:02:24.879> your<00:02:25.030> chest<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.330> lagging<00:02:25.569> don't<00:02:26.050> focus<00:02:26.440> on

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
if your chest is lagging don't focus on

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.080 
if your chest is lagging don't focus on
heavy<00:02:27.010> way<00:02:27.220> because<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:27.519> you're<00:02:27.640> using<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
heavy way because when you're using a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.160 
heavy way because when you're using a
lot<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.330> weight<00:02:28.599> you're<00:02:29.590> lagging

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
lot of weight you're lagging

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
lot of weight you're lagging
depart<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.770> usually<00:02:31.340> not<00:02:31.459> gonna<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.849> lot<00:02:32.060> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
depart is usually not gonna get a lot of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.910 
depart is usually not gonna get a lot of
the<00:02:32.300> action<00:02:33.140> especially<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:33.590> you're<00:02:33.680> doing<00:02:33.740> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the action especially if you're doing a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500 
the action especially if you're doing a
compound<00:02:34.310> movement<00:02:34.430> people<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.360> have

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
compound movement people to have

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
compound movement people to have
dominant<00:02:36.020> triceps<00:02:36.440> when<00:02:36.680> they<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.860> bench

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
dominant triceps when they do bench

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.670 
dominant triceps when they do bench
press<00:02:37.880> for<00:02:37.910> example<00:02:38.170> most<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.380> tension

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
press for example most of the tension

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.530 
press for example most of the tension
goes<00:02:39.800> set<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.220> their<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> triceps<00:02:41.150> yes

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
goes set it to their to the triceps yes

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.089 
goes set it to their to the triceps yes
the<00:02:41.780> chest<00:02:42.020> is<00:02:42.110> gonna<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.380> affected<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.010> your

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
the chest is gonna get affected but your

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.140 
the chest is gonna get affected but your
body<00:02:43.250> was<00:02:43.430> always<00:02:43.670> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.819> look<00:02:43.940> for<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
body was always going to look for the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.720 
body was always going to look for the
easiest<00:02:44.480> way<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.720> move<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.290> way<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.610> would

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
easiest way to move the way so I would

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.360 
easiest way to move the way so I would
say<00:02:46.940> blow<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> away<00:02:48.020> on<00:02:48.560> your<00:02:48.709> chest<00:02:48.890> exercises

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
say blow it away on your chest exercises

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
say blow it away on your chest exercises
and<00:02:49.730> focus<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:50.750> getting<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.170> blood<00:02:51.319> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and focus on just getting the blood and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.870 
and focus on just getting the blood and
they're<00:02:51.709> getting<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.190> mind<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.640> muscle

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
they're getting the mind and the muscle

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.690 
they're getting the mind and the muscle
connection<00:02:53.000> get<00:02:53.330> your<00:02:53.540> brain<00:02:53.810> used<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:55.400> using

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
connection get your brain used to using

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.729 
connection get your brain used to using
that<00:02:55.880> specific<00:02:56.540> muscle<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.080> like<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.530> said

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
that specific muscle and like I said

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.170 
that specific muscle and like I said
don't<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.250> only<00:02:58.430> gonna<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.670> done<00:02:58.940> through

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
don't it's only gonna be done through

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.550 
don't it's only gonna be done through
training<00:02:59.510> I'm<00:02:59.599> also<00:02:59.900> at<00:03:00.050> least<00:03:00.260> every<00:03:00.500> other
