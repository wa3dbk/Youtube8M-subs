00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.270
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.510
 Another video of me is my name 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.099
 bond buy back to the keyboard here 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.110
 is finally a starcraft 2 again 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.509
 replay and not just any replays 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.430
 the beginning of a best of three 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.340
 between jank and simple two 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.290
 exorbitant zerg players the most exorbitant 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.989
 Well, I have that of good one first 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.839
 forgotten once regal and indeed it's here 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.400
 the first game on the map neo planet 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.390
 and I'm very curious what the two 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.900
 and fell off 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.970
 both see each other I think every day 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.400
 battle net or at least pretty 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.619
 often know each other inside out 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.180
 the game from a tournament at the 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:55.040
 name I can not remember but 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.820
 I hope it will be a great game 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.500
 as I said best of three and as well 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.549
 already noticed this replays 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 bit shorter we all know want 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.290
 it goes out here he is the six pool 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 that is, during yang on pure sex 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.740
 something is quite risky 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.520
 cumbersome does not matter to anyone 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.840
 plays completely standard under and there 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.670
 we too can be wonderful 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.920
 See if it's worth it or not 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.899
 and how to react to such things 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.049
 How to spin a new fresh 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.969
 s.such things times old-established tgx 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.170
 pool or just in case a pool 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.450
 can attach 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 how does the depot do that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.710
 just like the standard silver ligalux 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.030
 I do not care about anyone 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.569
 But criticizing was but I know what I mean 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.450
 if you build relatively standard and 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.369
 haye says at 52 sometimes expansion 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.229
 and I'll see how that works 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.630
 and want a nice long game 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.170
 have him like it and build 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.909
 a pool 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.889
 However, we do not only see that here 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.960
 to rehearse recovered well 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.350
 still gas 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.719
 and that really means only one 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.429
 only thing namely when he left 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.009
 needs when nothing there comes that is also 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.470
 the mailing nest and there come the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.530
 first six of the blade very excited 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.850
 What love here is simple says 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 after seeing and having them 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.620
 he's seen now and of course i know 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 the pool also pure but in the pool 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.120
 it is much too late to be gas 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.350
 But no gas is discovered 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 Of course , the ticks are seen 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.390
 Grandson has to prove against it 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 defend 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.730
 I would be very curious how that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 Carinthia will fight 6 respectively 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.560
 benning a pool against standard gameplay 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.910
 lets go through in a few 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.160
 I am very curious 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.330
 and here we see how post then 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.180
 I 'm going to do the units first 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.670
 We will see immediately 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.560
 not next but tries all his 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.310
 threaten to get into a heap 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.690
 so that you afterwards the circle beautiful 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.280
 but can circle the anxiety naturally 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.290
 not stupid, of course, what to know 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.760
 and he has to do that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.350
 in a berning because if all in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.360
 sum crumps are trapped and there is one 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.300
 little exposed then it is actually 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 Almost game over 2 c sounds page 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.650
 of 18 each sound the first night of the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.330
 Sounds on the side of rooms and the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.640
 two-volume when here well blocked by 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.620
 room that makes he demands three banding 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 already at the start and they must now in 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.390
 tournaments here are several domain god 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.700
 oh god, what was that? 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.570
 just as the cyclicals were on sport 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.489
 nice detonated what an action what 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.590
 for a galaxy or animal wonderful 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.810
 he waited for the time to come 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 he knew that dietz sounded out of it 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.280
 hatch that has extremely waited 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.860
 as soon as it's donated, it explodes 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.959
 for a skill we look at the moment 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.840
 maybe that was it 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.390
 beyond good and evil we see 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.840
 to resound who are here are 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.269
 in here 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.150
 here knows that the same he knows it 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.260
 and just waiting for wonderful here 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.970
 his banding is here for me 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.480
 Looks and of course perfect timing 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.489
 wonderfully done so to action 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.290
 sense is looking forward to the second video 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.690
 from this best of three 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.540
 that will be linked here in others 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.400
 otherwise tell me if you know 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.729
 see more starcraft and warcraft 3 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.070
 I really want to leave it to you 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.470
 personally found warcraft 3 at the moment 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.300
 more exciting because yes I'm just one 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.770
 big fan of it but depending on what you 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.910
 I want to direct myself there completely after you 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.310
 I could always come back 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.900
 bit meisterkoch 2 so carsten 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.650
 boys have fun at the next video and 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.650
 Cha Cha
