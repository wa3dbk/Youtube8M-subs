these little ears right here and I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
these little ears right here and I
thought<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.549> super<00:01:21.000> cute<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> just

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
thought that it was super cute so I just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.740 
thought that it was super cute so I just
decided<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
decided to get this and I think this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
decided to get this and I think this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410

you walk too much the heel pot wears
down<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.750> then<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.110> get<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> metal

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
down and then you get to like the metal

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.710 
down and then you get to like the metal
inside<00:02:27.280> or<00:02:27.459> some<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.630> gets

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
inside or some like that and it gets

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
inside or some like that and it gets
really<00:02:28.900> hard<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.230> walk<00:02:29.350> after<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:29.980> big<00:02:30.130> E

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
