00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 brought you friends with you still 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.120
 rimas give in this series we'll take a look 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 can we boot old 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 preservation until which we are with you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 passed this company for rome company 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.390
 for a while we are quite long 163 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.099
 of moves we went through and we captured almost 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 I try a third of the world too I want you right away 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 maybe warn the mouse with you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 we take off because I have not loaded with 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.630
 this company and I want to note that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.430
 after all the patch of exactly after 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 additions of the imperial edition 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.180
 downloads are faster than us 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.649
 it was previously possible in guys 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 optimized and yes and see how 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.920
 quickly everything passes the corner we do n't even 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 flew perfectly well what 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.329
 booted this is good the second 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 let's check if everything works 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 we can rebuild for example main 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.390
 city ​​on the garrisons and amide no we can not 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 and watch roman 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.520
 urbs -12 food still affects the total from the sea 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 up as you know in the imperial building 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 this case is fixed 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.900
 maybe cities will consume food yes 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.840
 there they consume but influence that is 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.020
 influence of dumps on societies 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 order does not reflect this case 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 removed so I don’t know friends don’t know 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 if it makes sense to continue with this 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.140
 scenario may we play by the old 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 the scheme and the Roman village 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.899
 here everything is even the roman 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.820
 roman villages grazed update us 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 given the choice yes there build dad there 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.750
 market settlement either 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.969
 and celka agriculture or else in 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 general you i think you understand what i mean 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.130
 I speak 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.440
 Well, I do not know to continue no write 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.500
 in the comments if yes please 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.149
 continue if not and my opinion no no 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.770
 sense to continue like well under the old 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.900
 scheme all the more wrong here all 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.970
 done generally initially finally it 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.069
 case corrected the fact that the garbage affect 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.000
 social order precisely in large 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.790
 cities so sometimes I just build 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.470
 only cities level 2 and level 3 i 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.160
 never build it builds a little 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 landing in rome there in the capital somewhere else 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.010
 Well, here is a small imbalance 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.870
 With regards to the troops, all amendments are possible 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.200
 army 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.269
 the guys are most likely corrected for a bonus 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.269
 against infantry 0 well since it is 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.660
 ok write comments my opinion damn 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.569
 no no no don't know reluctance to start 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.930
 a company with old figs with chips hunting 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.350
 play exactly the game where the same and all 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.670
 innovations have been added write 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.920
 comments with you nullam ac 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.920
 see you all soon
