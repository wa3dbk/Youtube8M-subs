mechanism<00:00:10.920> should<00:00:10.950> he<00:00:11.460> consider<00:00:12.300> work<00:00:13.019> on

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
mechanism should he consider work on

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.950 
mechanism should he consider work on
they<00:00:14.250> weren't<00:00:14.490> should<00:00:14.910> should<00:00:15.240> never<00:00:15.509> arise

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
they weren't should should never arise

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.279 
they weren't should should never arise
yeah<00:00:16.770> there<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> no<00:00:17.609> such<00:00:17.940> concept<00:00:18.720> as<00:00:18.930> should

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
yeah there is no such concept as should

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.310 
yeah there is no such concept as should
with<00:00:19.529> regard<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.600> art<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.720> anything<00:00:21.990> unless

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
with regard to art or anything unless

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.939 
with regard to art or anything unless
you<00:00:22.439> specify<00:00:23.990> no<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.199> you're<00:00:25.350> trying<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> build

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you specify no if you're trying to build

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
you specify no if you're trying to build
a<00:00:26.130> bridge<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:27.060> say<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.480> should<00:00:27.720> do

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a bridge then you can say we should do

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
a bridge then you can say we should do
this<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.590> should<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.699> respect

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this and we should do that with respect

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290 
this and we should do that with respect
to<00:00:30.330> getting<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.869> bridge<00:00:31.140> built<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.850> doesn't

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to getting a bridge built but it doesn't

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.260 
to getting a bridge built but it doesn't
float<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.870> vacuum<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:34.920> feeling<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.820> art

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
float in a vacuum I my feeling about art

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
float in a vacuum I my feeling about art
is<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.920> important<00:00:38.700> aspect<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.329> art

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is that one very important aspect of art

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.840 
is that one very important aspect of art
is<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.050> makes<00:00:40.290> people<00:00:40.500> aware<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.520> what

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is that it makes people aware of what

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.500 
is that it makes people aware of what
they<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.980> know

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
they know and don't know what they know

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.670 
they know and don't know what they know
now<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.660> applies<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.360> all

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
now this applies not only to all all

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
creative thinking for example people on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
creative thinking for example people on
the<00:00:52.500> sea<00:00:52.739> coast<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> Middle<00:00:53.730> Ages<00:00:53.850> they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the sea coast in the Middle Ages they

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.529 
the sea coast in the Middle Ages they
knew<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.260> earth<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.410> round<00:00:56.000> they<00:00:57.000> believed

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
knew the earth was round they believed

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
knew the earth was round they believed
the<00:00:57.989> earth<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.199> flat<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> church

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the earth was flat because the church

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.020 
the earth was flat because the church
said<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.590> Galileo<00:01:01.590> says<00:01:01.980> he<00:01:02.460> tells<00:01:02.730> him<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
said so Galileo says he tells him the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
said so Galileo says he tells him the
earth<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.420> round<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.989> nearly<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.559> burned<00:01:05.129> at

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
earth is round and nearly was burned at

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.950 
earth is round and nearly was burned at
the<00:01:05.339> stake<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.970> saying<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.670> Suzanne<00:01:08.960> shows

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the stake for saying so Suzanne shows

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520 
the stake for saying so Suzanne shows
people<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:11.360> objects<00:01:12.360> looked<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.810> seen<00:01:13.200> from

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
people what objects looked at seen from

seeing a Suzanne there's what's the
breakthrough<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> made<00:01:35.540> there<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.630> no

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
breakthrough is made there is no

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.310 
breakthrough is made there is no
permanent<00:01:37.470> expansion<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> awareness<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
permanent expansion of awareness but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.429 
permanent expansion of awareness but
there's<00:01:41.130> always<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:43.040> reaction<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.610> rage<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
there's always a reaction of rage of

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.569 
there's always a reaction of rage of
outrage<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> first<00:01:47.640> breakthrough<00:01:48.110> and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
outrage at the first breakthrough and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
outrage at the first breakthrough and
for<00:01:50.579> example<00:01:50.850> choice<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.750> made<00:01:51.990> people

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
for example choice that made people

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
for example choice that made people
aware<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.710> their<00:01:53.689> their<00:01:54.689> stream<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
aware of their their stream of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.440 
aware of their their stream of
consciousness<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:56.130> least<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.850> level<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
consciousness at least on one level on a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.109 
consciousness at least on one level on a
verbal<00:01:57.750> level<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.250> he<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> first

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
verbal level and he was the first

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.020 
verbal level and he was the first
accused<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.869> being<00:02:01.189> unintelligible<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.369> don't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
accused of being unintelligible I don't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
accused of being unintelligible I don't
think<00:02:03.210> many<00:02:03.390> people<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.530> any

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
think many people now would have any

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.820 
think many people now would have any
difficulty

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
difficulty

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.700 
difficulty
Ulysses<00:02:06.960> no<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.860> artist<00:02:09.250> then<00:02:10.710> expands

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
Ulysses no so the artist then expands

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.620 
Ulysses no so the artist then expands
awareness<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.680> once<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.460> once<00:02:16.360> that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
awareness and once the once that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.020 
awareness and once the once that
breakthrough<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.380> made<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:18.160> becomes<00:02:18.550> part

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
breakthrough is made this becomes part

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.460 
breakthrough is made this becomes part
of<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.680> general<00:02:21.370> awareness
