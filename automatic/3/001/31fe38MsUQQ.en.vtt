00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.030

note<00:06:30.330> is<00:06:30.450> that<00:06:30.480> it's<00:06:30.720> not<00:06:31.200> fuel-efficient

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
note is that it's not fuel-efficient

00:06:32.040 --> 00:07:20.280 
note is that it's not fuel-efficient
either<00:06:32.250> just<00:06:33.120> give<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.330> a<00:06:33.390> few<00:06:33.420> reps

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.290 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.100 

it's<00:07:20.470> very<00:07:20.920> loud<00:07:21.160> engine<00:07:21.580> but<00:07:21.730> also<00:07:21.930> you<00:07:22.930> have

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
it's very loud engine but also you have

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.260 
it's very loud engine but also you have
a<00:07:23.140> loud<00:07:23.470> exhaust<00:07:23.650> note<00:07:24.220> to<00:07:24.400> really<00:07:24.760> complement

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
a loud exhaust note to really complement

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.750 
a loud exhaust note to really complement
it<00:07:25.360> at<00:07:25.450> least

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.180 

then<00:07:32.480> again<00:07:32.750> the<00:07:32.930> problem<00:07:33.620> at<00:07:33.740> the<00:07:33.860> Forte

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
then again the problem at the Forte

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.180 
then again the problem at the Forte
Revlimid

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.700 

it's<00:07:39.700> not<00:07:40.060> a<00:07:40.300> well-balanced<00:07:41.170> engine<00:07:41.440> either<00:07:41.560> I

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710 
it's not a well-balanced engine either I

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.800 
it's not a well-balanced engine either I
could<00:07:41.830> really<00:07:42.340> feel<00:07:42.610> the<00:07:42.670> vibrations<00:07:43.540> of<00:07:43.690> the

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
could really feel the vibrations of the

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.030 
could really feel the vibrations of the
engine<00:07:44.050> traveling<00:07:44.440> throughout<00:07:44.620> the<00:07:44.740> body<00:07:44.920> of

engine traveling throughout the body of
the<00:07:45.130> car<00:07:46.440> but<00:07:47.440> traditionally<00:07:48.130> when<00:07:48.790> I<00:07:48.850> sit

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 
the car but traditionally when I sit

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.330 
the car but traditionally when I sit
inside<00:07:49.330> a<00:07:49.390> Mustang<00:07:49.780> I'd<00:07:49.930> rather<00:07:50.220> listen<00:07:51.220> to

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
inside a Mustang I'd rather listen to

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.600 
inside a Mustang I'd rather listen to
the<00:07:51.490> sound<00:07:51.670> of<00:07:51.730> a<00:07:51.790> v8<00:07:52.170> yeah<00:07:53.170> in<00:07:53.350> 2005<00:07:53.980> we<00:07:54.250> had<00:07:54.430> an

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610 
the sound of a v8 yeah in 2005 we had an

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.250 
the sound of a v8 yeah in 2005 we had an
all-new<00:07:54.970> redesign<00:07:55.420> of<00:07:55.450> the<00:07:55.600> Mustang<00:07:56.020> had

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.260 
all-new redesign of the Mustang had

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.440 
all-new redesign of the Mustang had
brought<00:07:56.500> retro<00:07:56.980> looks<00:07:57.310> which<00:07:57.790> carried<00:07:58.330> over

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.450 
brought retro looks which carried over

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.410 
brought retro looks which carried over
into<00:07:58.750> the<00:07:58.840> present<00:07:59.410> 2013<00:08:00.400> model<00:08:00.790> Mustang

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:01.420 
into the present 2013 model Mustang

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.950 
into the present 2013 model Mustang
hopefully<00:08:02.260> in<00:08:02.550> 2015<00:08:03.550> were<00:08:03.760> going<00:08:04.240> to<00:08:04.390> see<00:08:04.600> an

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 
hopefully in 2015 were going to see an

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.410 
hopefully in 2015 were going to see an
all-new<00:08:05.530> Mustang<00:08:05.950> with<00:08:06.190> modern<00:08:06.910> independent

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:08.980 
rear suspension setup so that'll be

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.930 
rear suspension setup so that'll be
something<00:08:09.010> to<00:08:09.340> look<00:08:09.370> forward<00:08:09.670> to

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:09.940 
something to look forward to
