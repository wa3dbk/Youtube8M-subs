00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
 how very special this afternoon is for you 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 it is very special and a bit strange for me too 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.060
 we think that's a bit quick because some feet are weird to play 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.269
 against the club where you have been brought up for years actually 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.529
 It is nevertheless the clipper who experienced that a player that I am now 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.960
 put that makes it especially in the discussions when the trainer 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.749
 the talking as well as lazio become toni 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.419
 it seems 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.419
 that was all a little extra yes of course 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.570
 we are now with opponents yes that was the escape that must make 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.630
 actually very strange books when i did 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.920
 when the competition was running when I heard the news it was work 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 So 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 I think that hoped for playing minutes today, luckily it didn't happen 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.780
 you and via 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.340
 was just nice man 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.180
 play against those guests and has 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.060
 klaas and I miss laughing one after the other 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.000
 well it is a bit weird for everyone but yes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.760
 to swear the reality 6 he was still entitled to a penalty according to but 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.930
 to your cross 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.720
 also for 2011 according to meijer made the rest he claimed himself not alone 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420
 but for clarity said anthony 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.810
 German 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 it was kind he made it further 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 is proven today that twente is further than feyenoord 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.900
 of course not say but touch 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 think we are here today its twitter accounts few pages 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 and that while urk legitimate victory the here are still just one 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.650
 thief was shorter in the big difference for you between these two clubs 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.140
 t 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.520
 i think i think and see 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.909
 10 that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.050
 being at ajax after being a top club because of work 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.900
 and that ended in first place and feyenoord can be feyenoord 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.200
 causes a lot of pressure with it, but it is the beginning at twente 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 now also the case for when you look back on the past year perhaps 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.320
 in recent years 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.830
 why did not come out with you in the tub but the rest itself now 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.380
 to mind again 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.600
 yes i know i mean from after last season that started after all very well 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.229
 residents that man 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.059
 and that for me personally 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.739
 then it just went really well 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 and yes i think i am 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.799
 say something afterwards to the people client of 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.479
 that miss yes as if with shots led by walking to algeria young player and 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.809
 I think people like me had the feeling that I got nothing 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.939
 that I don't like being allowed to do anything anymore 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.019
 a bit had it but i am from last since they can bring it back 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.099
 season 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.530
 karin on look back on 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.119
 how well they sleep residents team 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.529
 and from me personally with distant parents 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.249
 second behind that it did but I think this worked 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.499
 years earlier 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.869
 eibergen come then you have the story with the contract 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.879
 it got a little bit there i'm doing jamie now munsterman has to 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.870
 us and in other media today you say then we don't all want it anyway 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.900
 little talk about it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.200
 again only five play this way and look zierikzee against all that calvin 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.199
 sustainable 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.409
 there we hear a bit stupid is just made 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.510
 the family circle in the color that are in 2006 here are the players of twente and 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.589
 there must improve 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.260
 this afternoon via or not double feelings or 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.799
 absolutely nothing you can just say is 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.669
 purpose of leaving the back door of course I'm glad we have 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.620
 won but yes like internet eyes pronunciation it is very weird though 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.490
 well i'm still 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.460
 just happy with the three points
