00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.740
 I bring a very serious accent why 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.010
 taking this delicious drink of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.140
 cocacola we realized that he had a 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.820
 gift and not exactly prizes to 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.289

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.210

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.970

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.760
 beans inside a coke but 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.540
 good 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 unfortunately we did not realize 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
 until I was almost in half if 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.260

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.210

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.760

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.979

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.370

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.860

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.860

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.230
