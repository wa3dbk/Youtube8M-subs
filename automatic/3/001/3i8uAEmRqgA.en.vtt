00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.739
 hello to you artur best in this 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.720
 video we take a look at one of the most 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.459
 uncharted places of our land underwater 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.940
 the world and talk about 10 unusual it 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:13.100
 anglerfish inhabitants can be considered as 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.720
 right the ugliest fish depth at 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.490
 which inhabits these creatures amaze 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.650
 imagination some individuals were 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.840
 found at a depth of almost 3000 meters 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.119
 their length can be up to two meters 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.440
 about combining with a giant mouth and jaw 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.690
 which has several rows 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.760
 sharp and bent inside teeth plus ko 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.470
 around the flexible structure of the trunk allows 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.569
 its swallow prey which is bigger and in 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.069
 twice a female has 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.899
 scion filled with mucus 

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:37.090
 which is inhabited by bacteria emitting 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.500
 shine 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.660
 but the process is most surprising 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.820
 mating males are 10 times less 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.110
 females they find a mate and starts 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 bump into a female 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.950
 after 10 days on the body of the female remains 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.840
 only ovaries from the male everything else 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.180
 atrophy but the male with 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.739
 merger does not kill the whole female 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.010
 can thus warm up to 10 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 partners 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.430
 one of the most unusual creatures 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.410
 the underwater world is a dragon fish in 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.510
 which is very powerful jaw and teeth 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.280
 are even on the tongue on the chin 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.170
 dragon fish have a long mouth on the end 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.820
 which is located photo for blinking 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.070
 swinging a predator right not like that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.900
 way your prey dragon fish attack 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.700
 all that can be eaten but 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.550
 the length of this fish is only 15 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 centimeters the world's only fish 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.240
 which has a transparent skull 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.160
 it lives macropinna at a depth of 500 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.180
 meters to that depth almost not 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.100
 light breaks through 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.740
 so this fish has adapted to see 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.180
 everything possible in the dark 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.860
 if you look at this fish in front 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.110
 one gets the impression of having a fish 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.330
 the eye but in fact this is an organ charm 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.009
 and the eye is inside and has green 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.930
 color goblin shark in a wonderful appearance 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.000
 muzzle fish has a big stretched forward 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.950
 hump information on it is not very much 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.750
 besides her appearance she has her 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.820
 kind of unique jaw front teeth 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 very sharp and the back are capable of times 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.660
 bite the bones of the shell in addition through 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.170
 reading is mobile and you are able to move 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.060
 out 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.250
 size it can not boast 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 average length is only 1 meter but 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.259
 three-meter specimens were also recorded 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.479
 representatives of the genus cyrax 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 it is a turn 7 millimeters long main 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.299
 their diet of whale bones 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.370
 interesting is the fact that they have neither 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.500
 not intestinal trait they secrete a caustic 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.890
 acid that can play dice 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 whales 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.640
 and bacteria living with them in symbiosis 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.900
 extract all substances from the bones which 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 need to live these worms 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.090
 another representative toothy saber tooth 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.590
 length is only 15 centimeters but this 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.570
 small fish very long teeth 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.250
 so large that when closing the mouth 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.050
 teeth placed a special place on 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.270
 upper jaw so even the brain 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 divided for this into two parts to hunt 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
 not on squid and small fish from 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.000
 eat a short time 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.560
 as much food as they weigh themselves however 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.690
 their remains are often found caught 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.490
 dances and the amount on the code says 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.160
 the fact that the saber tooth population is very 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.240
 Great is the most poisonous fish in the world 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.010
 considered stone fish 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.930
 found in the quiet and Indian Ocean 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 fish is not active and prefers to spend 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.370
 time lying on a reef setting fire to your victims 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.830
 on the back of the stone fish has 13 spikes 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.240
 which are very poisonous when touched 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.200
 with them the victim doesn't even understand where 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.120
 hit occurred 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 we feel severe pain because they eat 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.580
 destroys red blood cells and infects 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.170
 central nervous system of fish 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.240
 hatchets got their name for 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.070
 characteristic appearance can be found 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.780
 them at a depth of 600 meters but it happens that 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.000
 they are found at a depth of 2000 meters 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.560
 the hatchet also has a photo for 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.450
 only they are not bait 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.980
 on the contrary they are disguised 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.040
 only on the belly of the fish and their glow 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.900
 make the wigs invisible from below yet 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.690
 one creature dwelling on the ocean floor 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.760
 giant isopod until 2010 were not 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.530
 too well known in Japan by 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.690
 the apparatus did not raise one from the bottom 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.780
 who was able to live without food for four years 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.370
 2 but not up to 40 centimeters 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.530
 after the whales and the second largest goes 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.540
 giant shark reach length 10 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.190
 meters have an open mouth diameter of 3 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 meter happiness on feeds exclusively 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.480
 plankton and all other animals and not 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.980
 interested in and her teeth relatively 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.540
 small only five millimeters 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.860
 opportunity for it in spite of its 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.590
 huge sizes they are often 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.090
 subject to attack failure attacks on this 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.740
 our little underwater excursion 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.210
 the world is finished don't forget to bet 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.210
 thumb up all the best
