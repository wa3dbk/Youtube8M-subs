00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 i 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.670
 and well, we continue with our 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.349
 treatments with tension threads we have already 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.710
 worked other areas now we are going to 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.150
 make the forehead forehead normally 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.369
 you know that in aesthetic medicine we opt 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.110
 always for the botox and filled with 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.390
 hyaluronic acid when botox is not 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 enough to do a tensing but that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.650
 we have to fill in the wrinkle thanks to 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.080
 this new treatment you will see that it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.879
 produces a tension there already put a 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.760
 little bit let's put another bit a 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.530
 forehead tension the treatment of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.420
 botox you know that as much lasts five 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.930
 months with this we get it to last a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.549
 year and it is a very natural alternative 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.379
 to all the treatments and audio that 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.780
 we used before it was the Botox and the acid 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.489
 hyaluronic you will see the threads 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.350
 here they are also very thin as we use 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.360
 the other day in the jowl area are 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.369
 almost transparent and what is going to 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.379
 to do is a tension of the area 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.049
 she does not have much you see these 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.989
 wrinkles like that but let's make him 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.250
 it is totally ironed 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.170
 there are people who want to leave something 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.870
 wrinkle we put less others that do not want 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.420
 nothing we put more we go there 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.670
 the threads are the Japanese threads 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.210
 that do not give any problem is like 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.310
 we count another day are the last one let's go is 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 the latest evolution in threads because they are 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.920
 completely absorbable there are several 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.230
 types of length because when we see 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.970
 another one of other treatments according to the zone 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.550
 that we want to use here are used 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.710
 longer threads and in this area in the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.260
 Chin is the other day between my eyebrows 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 all the area of ​​the forehead and legs of 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.460
 We will use rooster and the very little ones 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.190
 like this or we are going there she has already 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.620
 put before always anesthesia how much 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.270
 a creampie does not need a cream 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.950
 that we prepare a little bit stronger than 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.290
 the one we already know all like the one in 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.640
 this is a little more concentrated is 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.440
 as a half hour as he has already put 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.650
 when we already have her asleep we start 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.230
 like your treatment that goes to the dermis 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.730
 It is not a superficial treatment 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.870
 then almost you will not find out is another 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.870
 deep enough inside 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.730
 Well, let's go there 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.530
 here also as in the whole subject of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.569
 threads that I already told you another day there is a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.730
 cross-linking to achieve this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.280
 tension you have to put several in the case 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.610
 from her we are going to put one or two 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.970
 we closed another here and a 23 because I already 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.100
 you have is here you see 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.100
 let's put here a 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.020
 we are making progress 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.180
 to the deep dermis then you can not see it 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.370
 you think that because it's a thread we're going to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.260
 have there we are going to make you so that you 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.360
 pull well here from above we have a 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.360
 opposite let's go with another 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.930
 you see this kid we are going to throw him there 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.550
 well here that she has left these 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.110
 wrinkles and we do not like 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.110
 let's make a cross here 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.160
 you see well 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.190
 we perform like this I'm going very 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.440
 slowly at the dermis level if it were not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.210
 at a deep level it is noted separately that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.970
 well I have been there for many years 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.560
 there is the dermal layer but the patient does not 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.120
 It is right away because it hurts when it does not 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.360
 it hurts is that we are good you see we have 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.360
 two there 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.900
 let's put another one here so that 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.050
 you have good and then I will cross 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.050
 here you have let's put the first one here 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.280
 so they are so fine we are going to put this 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.860
 all right 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.770
 so there goes 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.910
 it is going well 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.910
 you see how it's going 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.319
 already when it arrived here the top is very 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.450
 easy plus there is a little ball here that 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.170
 medium does not let me pass the needle that I do 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.690
 now stretched well and I take it out and inside 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.750
 the hilito was already 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.990
 let's see 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.800
 you see that there is neither practically nor 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.800
 you do not bleed 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 we removed well 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.670
 massage a little bit with a little bit of a 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.710
 pomade with arnica whenever we like 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.710
 for stretched well here 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.420
 You see, we stretch it 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.600
 so that it is totally crushed 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.040
 and these wrinkles that I already tell you another the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.110
 another option that we always use are the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.570
 stuffed or the Botox this is a 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.330
 alternative to our taste much better 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.870
 because we go to the letter putting the ones 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.870
 we need 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.249
 and it lasts much longer than the result 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.869
 totally natural 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.609
 and he had a wrinkle left 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:00.669
 residual of other treatments like this 

00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:04.869
 removed because here to see up a little bit 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.869
 low we're going to put you another little 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.050
 this and so we left it stretched a 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.050
 I'm going to cross it here 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.580
 ay valerón 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.099
 we removed stretched well so 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.310
 I take out slowly and there that the 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.310
 thread 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.029
 with the cookie I squeeze well 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.750
 You see here I put more because I already had 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.460
 this very marked here has almost no 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.410
 when they are facing is that you have to 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.550
 make them whole how many centuries do you have to 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.680
 put then maybe 6 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.050
 when there is an eyebrow there can be 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.920
 it has been done they put three and it makes you a 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.500
 stretching 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.720
 better than sometimes a botulinum toxin 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.190
 and I already tell you that the duration and 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.260
 much better naturalness 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.610
 here as you see is a little inflamed 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.610
 but then that goes down
