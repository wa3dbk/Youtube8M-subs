we<00:01:23.159> need<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:23.850> transitioning<00:01:24.240> rapidly

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we need to start transitioning rapidly

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490 
we need to start transitioning rapidly
to<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:26.070> state<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.790> clean<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> renewable<00:01:27.930> energy

to a state of clean and renewable energy

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.319 
to a state of clean and renewable energy
for<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.799> purposes<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.790> electricity

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
for all purposes that's electricity

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
for all purposes that's electricity
transportation<00:01:30.990> heating<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.009> cooling<00:01:32.189> in

transportation heating and cooling in
industrial<00:01:33.270> processes<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> means<00:01:35.040> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
industrial processes so this means that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.780 
industrial processes so this means that
even<00:01:35.939> starting<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.560> least<00:01:37.680> by<00:01:37.860> 2020

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
even starting now but at least by 2020

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
even starting now but at least by 2020
we<00:01:39.450> every<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.320> source<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.040> electricity<00:01:41.430> every

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we every new source of electricity every

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
we every new source of electricity every
new<00:01:42.240> transportation<00:01:42.960> should<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.710> clean<00:01:44.070> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
new transportation should be clean so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.969 
new transportation should be clean so
and<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.450> clean<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.290> wind<00:01:46.590> water

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and we think clean is like wind water

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.999 
and we think clean is like wind water
and<00:01:47.100> solar<00:01:47.250> power<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.899> electricity<00:01:49.229> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and solar power so for electricity it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
and solar power so for electricity it's
like<00:01:50.220> wind<00:01:50.430> turbines<00:01:50.880> solar<00:01:51.659> photovoltaics

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200

we need heat pumps that just extract

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
we need heat pumps that just extract

temperature processes we'd use

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.670

mind<00:02:26.860> word<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> deep<00:02:27.540> decentralization<00:02:28.540> fit

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
mind word is deep decentralization fit

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.520 
mind word is deep decentralization fit
into<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.260> strategy<00:02:30.510> yeah<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:32.260> think<00:02:32.470> that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
into this strategy yeah so we think that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.830 
into this strategy yeah so we think that
decentralization<00:02:33.489> is<00:02:33.730> important<00:02:34.269> but<00:02:34.510> it'll

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
decentralization is important but it'll

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.319 
decentralization is important but it'll
be<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.959> combination<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.769> decentralized<00:02:36.610> power

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
be a combination of decentralized power

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.770 
be a combination of decentralized power
plus<00:02:38.250> large-scale<00:02:39.250> power<00:02:39.459> plants<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.480> I

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
plus large-scale power plants because I

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.720 
plus large-scale power plants because I
mean<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.409> cover<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.950> rooftops<00:02:42.370> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
mean you can cover all the rooftops in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550 
mean you can cover all the rooftops in
the<00:02:43.120> United<00:02:43.450> States<00:02:43.510> or<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:43.989> world<00:02:44.200> with

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the United States or the world with

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.680 
the United States or the world with
solar<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.940> still<00:02:46.180> would<00:02:46.480> need<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.629> lot

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
solar and you still would need a lot

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.280 
solar and you still would need a lot
more<00:02:46.840> energy<00:02:47.079> than<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.769> have<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
more energy than you have and from the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.860 
more energy than you have and from the
from<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.709> from<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> rooftops<00:02:51.609> so<00:02:52.150> it's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
from that from the rooftops so it's

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.599 
from that from the rooftops so it's
really<00:02:53.079> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> combination<00:02:53.799> it's

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
really going to be a combination it's

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.099 
really going to be a combination it's
more<00:02:54.790> efficient<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.390> generate<00:02:56.079> electricity

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
more efficient to generate electricity

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.559 
more efficient to generate electricity
in<00:02:56.980> centralized<00:02:57.760> power<00:02:57.879> plants<00:02:58.209> particularly

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
in centralized power plants particularly

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.690 
in centralized power plants particularly
win<00:02:59.019> solar<00:02:59.379> it's<00:02:59.680> more<00:02:59.890> arguable<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.400> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
win solar it's more arguable that you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.300 
win solar it's more arguable that you
can<00:03:00.879> have<00:03:01.840> distributed<00:03:02.260> energy<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.829> get<00:03:02.980> high

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
can have distributed energy and get high

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.099 
can have distributed energy and get high
efficiencies<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.659> nice<00:03:04.870> thing<00:03:04.900> about

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
efficiencies the nice thing about

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.229 
efficiencies the nice thing about
distributed<00:03:05.739> energy<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:06.129> lower<00:03:06.430> transmission

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
distributed energy is lower transmission

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.899 
distributed energy is lower transmission
if<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:07.720> have<00:03:07.870> power<00:03:08.140> plants<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.890> are<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
if you have power plants that are in the

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.520 
if you have power plants that are in the
desert<00:03:10.030> for<00:03:10.390> example<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:11.019> are<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.319> Great

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
desert for example or are in the Great

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.289 
desert for example or are in the Great
Plains<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.069> u.s.<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.730> have<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.150> long

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
Plains in the u.s. you have to have long

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.550 
Plains in the u.s. you have to have long
distance<00:03:13.450> transmission<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.319> there's<00:03:14.500> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
distance transmission so there's a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.940 
distance transmission so there's a
trade-off<00:03:14.829> between<00:03:15.129> transmission<00:03:16.000> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
trade-off between transmission and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.379 
trade-off between transmission and
efficiency<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.069> these<00:03:18.220> large<00:03:18.579> power<00:03:19.299> plants

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
efficiency of these large power plants

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.800 
efficiency of these large power plants
but<00:03:20.349> I<00:03:20.380> think<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.739> need<00:03:20.829> both<00:03:21.209> yeah<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.630> I'm

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
but I think you need both yeah and I'm

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.170 
but I think you need both yeah and I'm
assuming<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> reason<00:03:23.769> why<00:03:23.919> solar<00:03:24.760> izing

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
assuming that the reason why solar izing

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
assuming that the reason why solar izing
every<00:03:25.540> building<00:03:25.930> wouldn't<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.739> enough<00:03:26.980> is

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
every building wouldn't be enough is

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.039 
every building wouldn't be enough is
because<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.519> industry<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.510> we're<00:03:29.019> all

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
because of industry is that we're all

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.680 
because of industry is that we're all
that<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.680> additional<00:03:30.280> power<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:30.760> well

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
that the additional power is going well

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.990 
that the additional power is going well
weird<00:03:32.410> because<00:03:32.709> we're<00:03:33.040> going<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.340> be<00:03:33.459> powering

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
weird because we're going to be powering

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.909 
weird because we're going to be powering
our<00:03:34.389> in<00:03:34.599> our<00:03:34.750> plans<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.260> power<00:03:35.470> repower<00:03:35.859> the

world in the US individual states and
countries<00:03:38.160> we're<00:03:39.160> converting<00:03:39.459> everything

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
countries we're converting everything

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.430 
countries we're converting everything
not<00:03:40.180> only<00:03:40.209> are<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:40.959> going<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.200> be<00:03:41.260> powering

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
not only are you going to be powering

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.349 
not only are you going to be powering
normal<00:03:41.799> electricity<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:42.519> we<00:03:42.669> do<00:03:42.790> today<00:03:42.819> but

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
normal electricity like we do today but

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.390 
normal electricity like we do today but
vehicles<00:03:43.780> will<00:03:44.079> be<00:03:44.349> powered<00:03:44.680> by<00:03:45.010> electricity

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
vehicles will be powered by electricity

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.339 
vehicles will be powered by electricity
even<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.970> its<00:03:46.120> hydrogen<00:03:46.449> will<00:03:46.690> be<00:03:46.810> hydrogen

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
even if its hydrogen will be hydrogen

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.289 
even if its hydrogen will be hydrogen
produced<00:03:47.709> from<00:03:47.919> electricity<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.730> heating

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
produced from electricity and heating

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.689 
produced from electricity and heating
and<00:03:49.540> cooling<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.139> transportation<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:51.430> we'll

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
and cooling and transportation so we'll

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.150 
and cooling and transportation so we'll
need<00:03:51.879> more<00:03:52.209> electricity<00:03:52.900> than<00:03:53.139> we<00:03:53.500> have<00:03:53.859> today

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
need more electricity than we have today

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.780 
need more electricity than we have today
and<00:03:55.319> yeah<00:03:56.319> so<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.919> can<00:03:57.190> if<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.639> actually

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
and yeah so that you can if you actually

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.569 
and yeah so that you can if you actually
add<00:03:58.060> up<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.329> numbers<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.769> would<00:03:59.919> still<00:04:00.220> you

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
add up the numbers you would still you

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.670 
add up the numbers you would still you
wouldn't<00:04:01.299> have<00:04:01.419> enough<00:04:01.660> rooftops<00:04:02.199> for

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
wouldn't have enough rooftops for

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.699 
wouldn't have enough rooftops for
example<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.129> power<00:04:03.419> all<00:04:04.530> let's<00:04:05.530> say<00:04:05.620> the

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
example to power all let's say the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.449 
United States on solar PV on the roofs
you<00:04:08.470> wouldn't<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.739> enough<00:04:08.859> rooftops<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.340> do

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
you wouldn't have enough rooftops to do

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.650 
you wouldn't have enough rooftops to do
that<00:04:09.609> how<00:04:09.819> do<00:04:09.879> we<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.269> point<00:04:10.419> where

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
that how do we get to the point where

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.220 
that how do we get to the point where
we're<00:04:10.900> doing<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.230> hotter<00:04:11.349> percent<00:04:11.799> renewables

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
we're doing a hotter percent renewables

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.699 
we're doing a hotter percent renewables
well<00:04:14.129> it<00:04:14.459> requires<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:15.629> not<00:04:15.959> rocket<00:04:16.229> science

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
well it requires it's not rocket science

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.460 
well it requires it's not rocket science
actually<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.549> think<00:04:17.579> it's<00:04:17.910> actually

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
actually we think it's actually

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.210 
actually we think it's actually

have<00:04:43.290> zero<00:04:43.560> fuel<00:04:43.800> costs<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.639> once<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:44.970> put<00:04:45.150> up

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
have zero fuel costs so once you put up

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.360 
have zero fuel costs so once you put up

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
PV the fuel cost is zero and so you

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.790 
PV the fuel cost is zero and so you

stabilize the price over time whereas

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.710 
stabilize the price over time whereas
fossil<00:04:53.190> fuel<00:04:53.400> prices<00:04:53.850> are<00:04:54.030> going<00:04:54.150> up<00:04:54.389> over

fossil fuel prices are going up over

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.840 
fossil fuel prices are going up over
time<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.620> we<00:04:55.680> look<00:04:55.770> at<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.130> ten<00:04:56.340> states<00:04:56.669> in

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.950 
last ten years this price of electricity
in<00:05:02.490> those<00:05:02.639> states<00:05:02.850> went<00:05:03.120> up<00:05:03.210> only<00:05:03.539> three<00:05:03.750> cents

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
in those states went up only three cents

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.450 
in those states went up only three cents
a<00:05:04.050> kilowatt<00:05:04.199> hour<00:05:04.590> all<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:04.919> other<00:05:05.160> states

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
a kilowatt hour all the other states

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.090 
a kilowatt hour all the other states
went<00:05:05.760> up<00:05:05.910> four<00:05:06.479> cents<00:05:06.840> in<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.530> kilowatt<00:05:07.949> hour

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
went up four cents in a kilowatt hour

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.980 
went up four cents in a kilowatt hour
and<00:05:08.370> hawaii<00:05:08.789> went<00:05:09.060> up<00:05:09.150> seventeen<00:05:09.630> cents<00:05:09.900> a

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
and hawaii went up seventeen cents a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.650 
and hawaii went up seventeen cents a
kilowatt<00:05:10.139> hour<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:12.030> evidence<00:05:12.419> that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
kilowatt hour so this is evidence that

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.629 
kilowatt hour so this is evidence that
you<00:05:13.169> stabilize<00:05:13.590> prices<00:05:13.620> when<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.340> put<00:05:14.520> up

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
you stabilize prices when you put up

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.210 
you stabilize prices when you put up
these<00:05:15.000> renewable<00:05:15.479> energy<00:05:15.990> sources<00:05:16.680> and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
these renewable energy sources and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.010 
these renewable energy sources and
transportation<00:05:18.120> it's<00:05:18.270> even<00:05:18.510> better<00:05:18.690> because

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
transportation it's even better because

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.290 
transportation it's even better because
electric<00:05:19.919> vehicles<00:05:20.310> are<00:05:20.580> four<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.910> five<00:05:21.060> times

electric vehicles are four to five times

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.659 
electric vehicles are four to five times
more<00:05:21.479> efficient<00:05:22.020> than<00:05:22.080> gasoline<00:05:22.500> vehicle<00:05:23.130> so

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
more efficient than gasoline vehicle so

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.180 
more efficient than gasoline vehicle so
if<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.630> effectively<00:05:25.380> pay<00:05:25.650> eighty<00:05:25.889> cents

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
if you you effectively pay eighty cents

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.680 
if you you effectively pay eighty cents
a<00:05:26.280> gallon<00:05:26.430> equivalent<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:27.240> drive<00:05:27.450> an<00:05:27.599> electric

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
a gallon equivalent to drive an electric

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.159 
a gallon equivalent to drive an electric
car<00:05:28.229> so<00:05:28.860> over<00:05:29.190> 15<00:05:29.580> years<00:05:29.820> if<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.180> drive<00:05:30.389> 15,000

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
car so over 15 years if you drive 15,000

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.570 
car so over 15 years if you drive 15,000
miles<00:05:31.260> per<00:05:31.500> year<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.860> will<00:05:31.950> save<00:05:32.190> twenty
