Welcome from AC News,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's see today's trailer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cinema news is coming up!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The 3rd of July 2012 The Amazing Spider-Man will be released,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the new version by Marc Webb on Peter Parker.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This time the plot is more complex and different characters come to the scene,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like Peter's father, Richard Parker,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
a biochemist who hides an interesting secret which will be tied

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to his sons destiny of becoming the legendary Spider-Man.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Sony has already officially launched the website

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
www.theamazingspiderman.com, and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
differently from other websites which are bare bone at the beginning,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
this one is already rich of information.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The actor Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) will be playing Peter Parker.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Brian DePalma, the director of The Black Dahlia and Femme Fatale,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is interested in a French remake of Love Crime, with the title of Passion.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Already casting Noomi Rapace,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
now Thompson on Hollywood reports that also Rachel McAdams will be part of the project.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The story is about a young woman that takes her vengeance

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
on her female older boss because she has suffered one to much.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The only doubt is that the two actresses are very close by age and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
it's difficult to imagine who will play who and if it will work.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Both actresses are to be seen together in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, now screening.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That's all for today,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
see you soon from AC News!
