side<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.740> then<00:03:27.640> we're<00:03:27.970> going<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.180> put<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.720> back

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
side and then we're going to put it back

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.710 
side and then we're going to put it back
to<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.110> oven<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:29.880> cook<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.150> another<00:03:31.240> half

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
to the oven for cook for another half

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.440 
to the oven for cook for another half
hour<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:32.700> toward<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> end<00:03:33.880> I'm<00:03:34.240> going

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
hour and then toward the end I'm going

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.400 
hour and then toward the end I'm going
to<00:03:34.570> crank<00:03:35.170> my<00:03:35.410> oven<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.250> boiler<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.080> just

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
to crank my oven to the boiler and just

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.940 
to crank my oven to the boiler and just
let<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.160> boiler<00:03:39.730> work<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.360> magic<00:03:40.950> brung

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
let the boiler work on the magic brung

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.490 
let the boiler work on the magic brung
up<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.940> skin<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.800> few<00:03:44.980> minutes<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.660> all

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you can cook this with the like rack you

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.270 
you can cook this with the like rack you
know<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> wire<00:03:52.630> rack<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.140> top<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.709> let

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.940 
to the tray at the bottom hope you find
two<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:58.930> I'm<00:03:59.020> going<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.260> put<00:03:59.380> this<00:03:59.470> into<00:03:59.739> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
two so I'm going to put this into the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.210 
two so I'm going to put this into the
oven<00:03:59.980> again<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:00.820> by<00:04:01.060> looking<00:04:01.300> at<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.690> color

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
oven again so by looking at the color

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.270 
oven again so by looking at the color
this<00:04:03.220> has<00:04:03.430> been<00:04:03.459> into<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.180> oven<00:04:04.590> about<00:04:05.590> 55

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
this has been into the oven about 55

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.820 
this has been into the oven about 55
minutes<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.840> then<00:04:07.840> i<00:04:07.959> just<00:04:07.989> used<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
minutes and then i just used the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.270 
minutes and then i just used the
denominator<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.400> check<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.000> 162<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.920> i

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
denominator and check it is 162 so i

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.930 
denominator and check it is 162 so i
just<00:04:12.340> start<00:04:12.880> in<00:04:13.120> my<00:04:13.209> oven<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.720> broil<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.940> want

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
just start in my oven to broil it I want

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.690 
just start in my oven to broil it I want
the<00:04:16.090> skin<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.570> crispy<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.350> more<00:04:18.160> brown<00:04:18.459> in

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.330 
the skin to be crispy and more brown in
color<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.540> I'm<00:04:19.630> going<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.840> put<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.590> oven

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
color so I'm going to put in the oven

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.650 
color so I'm going to put in the oven
for<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:23.350> boil<00:04:23.770> for<00:04:24.070> maybe<00:04:24.310> another<00:04:24.660> four
