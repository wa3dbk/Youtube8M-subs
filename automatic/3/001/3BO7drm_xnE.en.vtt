00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
is maybe to wait about a week really you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
is maybe to wait about a week really you
can<00:02:10.890> use<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.190> away<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:11.879> depends<00:02:12.420> on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
can use it right away it just depends on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.020 
can use it right away it just depends on
how<00:02:12.660> much

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
how much

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.570 
how much
cooks<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.500> wait<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> week<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.100> two<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
cooks out if you wait a week or two it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.430

out of our mold here comes out fairly

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.630 
out of our mold here comes out fairly
easily<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:39.280> doesn't<00:02:39.520> even

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
easily and this actually doesn't even

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.070 
easily and this actually doesn't even
have<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.970> go<00:02:40.090> overnight<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.810> actually

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
have to go overnight you can actually

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.140 
have to go overnight you can actually
cut<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.500> sooner<00:02:41.830> than<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.910> really

nice<00:02:56.320> straight<00:02:56.650> slices<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.370> used<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.940> try<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.150> do

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
nice straight slices I used to try to do

it<00:02:58.569> just<00:02:58.930> kind<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.530> by<00:02:59.650> eyeballing<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.870> as

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
it just kind of by eyeballing it and as

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.270 
it just kind of by eyeballing it and as
much<00:03:02.080> as<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.380> thought<00:03:02.530> my<00:03:02.709> slices<00:03:03.130> were

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
much as I thought my slices were

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.590 
much as I thought my slices were
straight<00:03:03.580> when<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.790> was<00:03:03.880> done<00:03:04.150> they<00:03:04.330> did<00:03:04.480> not

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
straight when I was done they did not

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.290 
straight when I was done they did not
turn<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:04.989> right<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.470> first<00:03:06.190> I'm<00:03:06.640> going<00:03:06.970> to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.570 
turn out right so first I'm going to
slice<00:03:07.870> off<00:03:08.370> ends

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
slice off ends

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:20.520 
slice off ends
