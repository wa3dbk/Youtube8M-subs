00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's a possibility definitely um and I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.610 
it's a possibility definitely um and I
thinking<00:00:59.399> game<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.820> will<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.449> um

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
thinking game for it will do it but um

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.900 
thinking game for it will do it but um
yeah<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.920> possibility<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
yeah it's possibility that could be a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
yeah it's possibility that could be a
grass<00:01:03.270> ice<00:01:03.480> type<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
grass ice type but really it's just it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
grass ice type but really it's just it
would<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:05.970> weak<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> fire<00:01:06.540> certain

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
would make it too weak to fire certain

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.510 
would make it too weak to fire certain
it's<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.860> making<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.549> worse<00:01:08.729> right

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's just you know making it worse right

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's just you know making it worse right
next<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.729> octave<00:01:12.450> foosh<00:01:12.860> alarm<00:01:13.860> fish

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
design of Malta lyst you find still

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
design of Malta lyst you find still
typing<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.909> slightly<00:01:27.240> typing<00:01:28.110> their<00:01:28.290> five

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
typing or slightly typing their five

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.700 
typing or slightly typing their five
steals<00:01:29.400> you've<00:01:29.610> had<00:01:29.790> each<00:01:30.000> round<00:01:30.210> before<00:01:30.710> but

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
steals you've had each round before but

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
steals you've had each round before but
I'm<00:01:31.829> starting<00:01:32.430> people<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> why<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> might<00:01:33.329> be

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I'm starting people and why it might be

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
I'm starting people and why it might be
good<00:01:34.070> office<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.189> still<00:01:35.400> doesn't<00:01:35.700> resist

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
good office is still doesn't resist

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140 
good office is still doesn't resist
water<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.110> there's<00:01:37.290> no<00:01:37.380> difference<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:38.150> but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
water so there's no difference there but

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
water so there's no difference there but
um<00:01:39.329> yeah<00:01:40.579> definitely<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.909> possible

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
um yeah definitely think it's possible

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.350 
um yeah definitely think it's possible
and<00:01:42.920> also<00:01:43.920> steer<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.820> effectively<00:01:45.240> as

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and also steer was then effectively as

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.990 
and also steer was then effectively as
ice<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> did<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
ice as well so if you did have this this

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
ice as well so if you did have this this
grass<00:01:48.360> types<00:01:48.689> dipole<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.229> should<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
grass types dipole which should be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
grass types dipole which should be
completely<00:01:49.979> screwed<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.119> four

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
completely screwed because it's four

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
completely screwed because it's four
times<00:01:52.259> Queens<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> fire<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.460> just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
times Queens to fire and then we just

in<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:09.410> nightmares<00:03:10.370> all<00:03:10.549> see<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
in that and then nightmares all see it

good<00:03:10.970> correspondence<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.440> i'm<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:12.590> sure

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
good correspondence to it i'm not sure

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.500 
good correspondence to it i'm not sure
i'll<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.579> white<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.970> its<00:03:14.090> wings<00:03:14.299> though

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
i think it might work better being

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.849 
i think it might work better being
sinker<00:03:16.280> as<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.489> body<00:03:16.639> doing<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.940> dark<00:03:17.180> blue<00:03:17.859> but

sinker as the body doing a dark blue but

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.590 
sinker as the body doing a dark blue but
that's<00:03:19.040> what<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.310> ohm<00:03:19.430> spider<00:03:20.030> chose<00:03:20.329> so

there's<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.230> most<00:03:42.349> probable<00:03:42.859> outcome<00:03:43.099> really

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
there's the most probable outcome really

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.860 
there's the most probable outcome really
and<00:03:46.099> then<00:03:46.370> here<00:03:46.549> we<00:03:46.669> have<00:03:46.940> chipping<00:03:47.630> and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and then here we have chipping and

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.890 
and then here we have chipping and
monchique<00:03:48.730> being<00:03:49.730> no<00:03:49.880> types<00:03:50.239> obviously<00:03:50.750> very

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
monchique being no types obviously very

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.479 
monchique being no types obviously very
similar<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.200> Bidoof<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:52.160> Burrell<00:03:52.459> but

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
similar to Bidoof and the Burrell but

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.659 
similar to Bidoof and the Burrell but
based<00:03:53.180> on<00:03:53.299> chipmunks<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:55.400> design

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
based on chipmunks here the design

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.849 
based on chipmunks here the design
munching<00:03:56.299> looks<00:03:56.480> pretty<00:03:56.750> damn<00:03:56.870> cool<00:03:57.079> chipping

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
munching looks pretty damn cool chipping

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.409 
munching looks pretty damn cool chipping
how<00:03:58.010> I've<00:03:58.099> not<00:03:58.250> too<00:03:58.370> short<00:03:58.579> space<00:03:58.940> can<00:03:59.239> looked

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
how I've not too short space can looked

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.870 
how I've not too short space can looked
a<00:03:59.480> bit<00:03:59.510> too<00:03:59.810> wide<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:01.010> rest<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.280> point<00:04:01.519> is<00:04:01.579> fine

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
a bit too wide the rest is point is fine

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.199 
a bit too wide the rest is point is fine
though<00:04:02.150> but<00:04:02.840> i'm<00:04:02.989> generally<00:04:03.799> liking<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.190> look

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
though but i'm generally liking a look

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.459 
though but i'm generally liking a look
also<00:04:06.209> been<00:04:06.329> no<00:04:06.510> x<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.959> region<00:04:07.290> being

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
also been no x the region being

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.110 
also been no x the region being
equipment<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:07.890> Rattata<00:04:08.959> Sentret<00:04:10.519> etc<00:04:11.519> um<00:04:11.760> I

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
equipment to Rattata Sentret etc um I

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.490 
equipment to Rattata Sentret etc um I
think<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.480> would<00:04:12.569> be<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.689> good<00:04:12.870> choice<00:04:13.170> i<00:04:13.409> was

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
think it would be a good choice i was

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.140 
think it would be a good choice i was
even<00:04:13.650> out<00:04:13.680> how<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.040> hand<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.579> back<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:15.000> don't

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
even out how to hand it back so don't

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.270 
even out how to hand it back so don't
think<00:04:15.359> before<00:04:15.659> so<00:04:16.350> again<00:04:16.829> there<00:04:17.009> might<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.160> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
think before so again there might be a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.110 
think before so again there might be a
good<00:04:17.459> addition<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.880> Ed<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.940> then<00:04:20.940> here<00:04:21.090> we

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
good addition to Ed and then here we

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.490 
good addition to Ed and then here we
have<00:04:21.209> Maghreb<00:04:21.810> dung<00:04:22.470> guard<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.979> bezel<00:04:23.699> buzz

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
have Maghreb dung guard and bezel buzz

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.770 
have Maghreb dung guard and bezel buzz

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
something that I'm not exactly sure and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.230 
something that I'm not exactly sure and
then<00:04:52.590> bezel<00:04:52.949> buzz<00:04:53.099> looks<00:04:53.310> pretty<00:04:53.550> cool<00:04:53.699> with

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
then bezel buzz looks pretty cool with

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
also based on a fly I'm guessing so a

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.650 
also based on a fly I'm guessing so a
dung<00:04:59.340> beetle<00:04:59.370> fly<00:04:59.970> line<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:02.479> next<00:05:03.479> up

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
dung beetle fly line really and next up

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.890 
dung beetle fly line really and next up

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
we have doop doop is a poison-type and

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.260 
we have doop doop is a poison-type and
what<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.830> didn't<00:05:08.099> even<00:05:08.190> tell<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.669> was<00:05:08.849> based<00:05:09.090> on

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
it seems to have two forms I'm guessing

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.370 
it seems to have two forms I'm guessing
