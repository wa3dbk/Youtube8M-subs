00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
is to take the positive out of it and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.740 
is to take the positive out of it and
see<00:02:46.100> what<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.430> be<00:02:46.790> made<00:02:46.970> from<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.360> rather

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
than focus on the negative and kind of

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.250 
than focus on the negative and kind of
continue<00:02:49.970> forward<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.690> positive<00:02:50.870> manner
