way<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.079> can<00:03:38.349> feel<00:03:38.590> better<00:03:38.769> about<00:03:38.920> what

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
way you can feel better about what

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.800 
way you can feel better about what
you're<00:03:39.519> doing<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.909> usually<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.329> comes<00:03:40.629> with

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
you're doing and usually that comes with

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.960 
you're doing and usually that comes with
a<00:03:40.840> sense<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.170> accomplishment<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:42.670> know

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
a sense of accomplishment so you know

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.059 
a sense of accomplishment so you know
make<00:03:43.180> your<00:03:43.209> list<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.780> five<00:03:44.379> things<00:03:44.409> once

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
make your list of five things once

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.500 
make your list of five things once
you're<00:03:45.250> done<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.430> those<00:03:45.640> five<00:03:45.940> things<00:03:45.970> and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
you're done with those five things and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.780 
you're done with those five things and
they<00:03:46.659> should<00:03:46.900> be<00:03:46.930> money<00:03:47.859> making<00:03:48.459> activities

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
they should be money making activities

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.059 
they should be money making activities
so<00:03:49.629> social<00:03:50.079> media<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.709> money-making

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069
