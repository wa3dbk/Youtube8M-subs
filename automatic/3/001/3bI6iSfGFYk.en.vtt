is exactly how to cow it sounds you just

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.240 
is exactly how to cow it sounds you just

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
up onto the handle of the knife and use

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.370 
up onto the handle of the knife and use
it<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:16.490> make<00:01:16.610> like<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.969> kind<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.450> modified<00:01:17.960> pinch

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.350 
really the blade use it to rock on the
board<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:24.560> big<00:01:25.369> disadvantage<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.090> grip<00:01:26.329> is

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
board a big disadvantage to this grip is

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.359 
board a big disadvantage to this grip is
it<00:01:26.600> requires<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:27.049> lot<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.409> knuckle<00:01:27.920> clearance

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
it requires a lot of knuckle clearance

it requires a lot of knuckle clearance
if<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.909> don't<00:01:29.090> have<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> fairly<00:01:29.569> tall<00:01:29.840> blade

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
between the handle and the board so you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.429 
between the handle and the board so you
have<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.850> move<00:01:35.060> around<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.659> it<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.229> not<00:01:36.380> a

regularly this grip gets especially

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.389 
regularly this grip gets especially
awkward<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> Japanese<00:01:42.530> why<00:01:42.770> handled<00:01:43.220> knife

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
awkward on a Japanese why handled knife

such<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.819> this<00:01:43.970> one<00:01:44.209> because<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.959> handle<00:01:45.259> is

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380

something<00:02:50.370> important<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.880> remember<00:02:51.060> when

something important to remember when

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940 
something important to remember when
using<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.630> grip<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.840> not<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.380> squeeze<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
using this grip is not to squeeze the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.000 
using this grip is not to squeeze the
knife<00:02:53.130> there's<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.550> not<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.269> whole<00:02:54.390> lot<00:02:54.750> of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
knife there's really not a whole lot of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.580 
knife there's really not a whole lot of
control<00:02:56.010> being<00:02:56.340> given<00:02:57.060> as<00:02:57.690> far<00:02:57.959> as<00:02:58.110> forward

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
control being given as far as forward

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.860 
control being given as far as forward
and<00:02:58.739> backward<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.000> really<00:03:00.269> more<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and backward so this is really more of a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.250 
and backward so this is really more of a
grace<00:03:01.350> based<00:03:01.769> knife<00:03:02.730> rip<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.600> can<00:03:03.780> use<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.959> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
grace based knife rip you can use it to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
grace based knife rip you can use it to
a<00:03:04.290> slice<00:03:04.709> protein<00:03:05.220> such<00:03:05.550> as<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.790> chicken<00:03:06.239> or

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
a slice protein such as this chicken or

a slice protein such as this chicken or
fish<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:07.739> crazy<00:03:08.610> thin

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
fish and you can just get crazy thin

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.059 
fish and you can just get crazy thin
slices<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.810> mean<00:03:10.290> these<00:03:10.410> aren't<00:03:10.620> even<00:03:10.860> staying

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
slices I mean these aren't even staying

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.949

just<00:03:16.019> cut<00:03:16.290> very<00:03:16.530> small<00:03:17.040> things<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:17.850> just<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
just cut very small things it's just a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.930 
just cut very small things it's just a
lot<00:03:18.480> easier<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:19.470> cut<00:03:19.709> through<00:03:19.920> things<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.910> a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
lot easier to cut through things with a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.210 
lot easier to cut through things with a
slicing<00:03:21.269> motion<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.959> one<00:03:22.470> direction<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
slicing motion in one direction and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
slicing motion in one direction and
using<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:23.910> grip<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:24.420> helps<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.870> the
