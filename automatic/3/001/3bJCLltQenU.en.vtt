00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.949 

I<00:00:01.350> want<00:00:02.350> to<00:00:02.530> go<00:00:02.740> on<00:00:03.100> and<00:00:03.400> paint<00:00:04.029> the<00:00:04.569> flowers

00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:04.959 
I want to go on and paint the flowers

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:06.869 
I want to go on and paint the flowers
now<00:00:05.169> and<00:00:05.620> looking<00:00:06.189> at<00:00:06.310> the<00:00:06.370> reference<00:00:06.519> photo

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:06.879 
now and looking at the reference photo

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.670 
now and looking at the reference photo
we're<00:00:07.209> concentrating<00:00:07.539> on<00:00:07.899> these<00:00:08.109> two<00:00:08.410> flowers

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
we're concentrating on these two flowers

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.240 
we're concentrating on these two flowers
what<00:00:09.639> we<00:00:09.790> need<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.120> do<00:00:10.299> is<00:00:10.540> bring<00:00:10.929> make<00:00:11.799> it<00:00:12.040> look

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
what we need to do is bring make it look

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.249 
what we need to do is bring make it look
as<00:00:12.429> though<00:00:12.460> that<00:00:12.759> flowers<00:00:13.540> disappear<00:00:13.959> under

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
as though that flowers disappear under

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.260 
as though that flowers disappear under
that<00:00:14.379> one<00:00:14.589> and<00:00:14.799> so<00:00:14.950> we<00:00:15.099> need<00:00:15.280> to<00:00:15.309> put<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:15.820> dark

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
that one and so we need to put the dark

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.640 
that one and so we need to put the dark
tone<00:00:16.660> in<00:00:16.870> there<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.970> of<00:00:19.090> all<00:00:19.269> and<00:00:19.600> then<00:00:20.140> we

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
tone in there first of all and then we

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.250 
tone in there first of all and then we
need<00:00:20.859> to<00:00:20.890> make<00:00:21.220> one<00:00:21.519> petal<00:00:22.029> come<00:00:22.449> up<00:00:22.599> against

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
need to make one petal come up against

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.820 
need to make one petal come up against
another<00:00:23.529> but<00:00:24.250> we<00:00:24.429> have<00:00:24.640> this<00:00:25.679> problem<00:00:26.679> that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
another but we have this problem that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.580 
another but we have this problem that
the<00:00:27.189> petals<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.179> darker<00:00:28.869> pink<00:00:29.080> around<00:00:29.410> the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
the petals a darker pink around the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.060 
the petals a darker pink around the
outside<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.390> we<00:00:31.570> have<00:00:31.720> all<00:00:32.050> those<00:00:32.320> things<00:00:32.380> to

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
outside so we have all those things to

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.889 
outside so we have all those things to
consider<00:00:33.610> when<00:00:33.820> we're<00:00:33.969> painting<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.360> flowers

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
consider when we're painting the flowers

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.619 
consider when we're painting the flowers
also<00:00:35.620> we<00:00:36.460> have<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.730> consider<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.360> fact<00:00:37.570> that

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
also we have to consider the fact that

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
also we have to consider the fact that
we<00:00:37.809> want<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.079> make<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:39.219> stamens<00:00:40.620> stand<00:00:41.620> out

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we want to make the stamens stand out

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.479 
we want to make the stamens stand out
against<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.390> darker<00:00:44.079> petals<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.039> they<00:00:45.309> all

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
against the darker petals so they all

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.189 
against the darker petals so they all
they'll<00:00:46.030> come<00:00:46.239> out<00:00:46.390> in<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.690> finished<00:00:46.989> picture

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
they'll come out in the finished picture

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.350 
they'll come out in the finished picture
so<00:00:47.530> all<00:00:48.039> those<00:00:48.309> things<00:00:48.550> have<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.879> be<00:00:48.910> taken

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
so all those things have to be taken

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.619 
so all those things have to be taken
into<00:00:49.449> consideration<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:50.559> need<00:00:51.370> some<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.270> the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
into consideration I need some of the

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:03.509 
into consideration I need some of the
cobalt<00:00:53.289> violet<00:01:01.920> I'll<00:01:02.920> be<00:01:02.980> able<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.190> use<00:01:03.309> some

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
cobalt violet I'll be able to use some

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.220 
cobalt violet I'll be able to use some
of<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.670> cerulean<00:01:04.269> in<00:01:04.480> here<00:01:04.720> as<00:01:04.840> well<00:01:04.990> and<00:01:05.170> I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
of the cerulean in here as well and I

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.830 
of the cerulean in here as well and I
think<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:08.490> start<00:01:09.490> by<00:01:09.550> wetting<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:12.840> two

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
think so start by wetting where the two

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.190 
think so start by wetting where the two
flowers<00:01:14.580> overlap<00:01:18.240> water<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.810> know<00:01:19.960> water

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
flowers overlap water you know water

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.370 
flowers overlap water you know water
will<00:01:20.530> we'll<00:01:20.860> never<00:01:21.550> do<00:01:21.760> any<00:01:21.970> harm<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.690> it's

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
will we'll never do any harm it's it's

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.070 
will we'll never do any harm it's it's
all<00:01:23.500> good<00:01:23.800> just<00:01:24.040> clean<00:01:24.280> water<00:01:24.660> will<00:01:25.660> just<00:01:25.690> help

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
all good just clean water will just help

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.070 
all good just clean water will just help
you<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.700> pigment<00:01:28.000> will<00:01:28.360> run<00:01:28.600> into<00:01:28.960> it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
you because the pigment will run into it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:39.060 
you because the pigment will run into it
and<00:01:29.260> look<00:01:29.710> wonderful

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.289 

and<00:01:40.070> let's<00:01:40.250> see<00:01:40.430> what<00:01:40.549> happens<00:01:40.909> when<00:01:40.969> I<00:01:41.090> drop<00:01:41.240> a

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
and let's see what happens when I drop a

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.630 
and let's see what happens when I drop a
little<00:01:41.479> bit<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:42.310> cerulean<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.430> there

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
little bit of the cerulean in there

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.550 
little bit of the cerulean in there
makes<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.719> lovely<00:01:45.850> lilac<00:01:46.850> color<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.259> because

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
makes a lovely lilac color and because

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.630 
makes a lovely lilac color and because
that's<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> shade<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.369> some<00:01:52.369> blue

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
that's in the shade there is some blue

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:07.320 
that's in the shade there is some blue
in<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.159> that's<00:01:55.159> quite<00:01:55.460> nice

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.570 

I<00:02:07.420> already<00:02:08.020> started<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:08.800> put<00:02:08.950> some<00:02:08.979> coloring

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
I already started to put some coloring

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.000 
I already started to put some coloring
behind<00:02:09.940> these<00:02:10.320> Stainland<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:11.530> they'll<00:02:11.740> stand

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
behind these Stainland so they'll stand

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.850 
behind these Stainland so they'll stand
out<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.240> going<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.440> take<00:02:17.650> one

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
out then I'm going to go and take one

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.150 
out then I'm going to go and take one
one<00:02:18.160> petal<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> time<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.360> drop<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
one petal at a time and drop in the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.910 
one petal at a time and drop in the
color<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.970> edges<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.630> wetting<00:02:23.590> first

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
color around the edges so wetting first

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.620 
color around the edges so wetting first
I'll<00:02:24.310> wet<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.490> whole<00:02:24.730> petal<00:02:25.210> let's<00:02:25.360> start

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
I'll wet the whole petal let's start

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.810 
I'll wet the whole petal let's start
with<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:29.010> I'll<00:02:30.010> take<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> water<00:02:30.460> down

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
with this one I'll take the water down

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.260 
with this one I'll take the water down
behind<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.890> stamens<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.820> pain<00:02:34.060> will

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
behind the stamens so that the pain will

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.420 
behind the stamens so that the pain will
spread<00:02:34.600> there<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.560> take<00:02:35.800> some<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.190> pink

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
spread there now take some of the pink

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.360 
spread there now take some of the pink
and<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:36.940> drop<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:38.310> around<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.520> edge<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.020 

then<00:02:45.370> allow<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.140> spread<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.910> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
then allow it to just spread in and I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.699 
then allow it to just spread in and I
think<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.660> stage<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:50.170> well

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
think at this stage as well

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.770 
think at this stage as well
I<00:02:50.740> will<00:02:51.370> also<00:02:51.970> stroke<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:53.730> those<00:02:54.780> central

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I will also stroke in those central

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.930 
I will also stroke in those central
veins<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.500> go<00:02:56.560> along<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> central<00:02:57.550> the

cobalt violet to do this there we are

cobalt violet to do this there we are
that's<00:03:09.040> better<00:03:09.780> wet<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:11.020> wet<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.370> because

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
that's better wet in wet but and because

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.910 
that's better wet in wet but and because
you<00:03:12.790> are<00:03:12.850> using<00:03:13.060> thicker<00:03:13.480> paint<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.709> won't

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you are using thicker paint it won't

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.540 
you are using thicker paint it won't
spread<00:03:15.190> too<00:03:15.459> much<00:03:15.730> using<00:03:16.180> let's<00:03:16.959> do<00:03:17.110> another

spread too much using let's do another

the<00:03:23.290> reason<00:03:23.590> I'm<00:03:23.709> wetting<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:25.620> I'm

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the reason I'm wetting it is because I'm

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.500 
the reason I'm wetting it is because I'm
going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.070> drop<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.400> color<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.150> don't

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
going to drop the color in and I don't

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
going to drop the color in and I don't
want<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.959> make<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.140> line<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.800> wanted<00:03:30.100> to

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
want it to make a line I wanted to

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.030 
want it to make a line I wanted to
spread<00:03:30.550> naturally<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.350> will<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.680> if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
spread naturally so it will do that if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.120 
spread naturally so it will do that if
you<00:03:33.160> got<00:03:33.310> water<00:03:33.580> down<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.680> won't<00:03:35.920> if<00:03:36.100> you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
you got water down it won't if you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.850 
you got water down it won't if you
happen

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.630 

the<00:03:44.860> veins

the veins

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.940 
the veins
they're<00:03:46.180> usually<00:03:46.390> three<00:03:46.870> veins<00:03:47.260> going<00:03:47.680> down

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
they're usually three veins going down

they're usually three veins going down
the<00:03:48.069> center

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.780 

like<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.520> whole<00:03:58.640> petal<00:03:59.470> pink<00:04:00.470> color<00:04:00.790> just

like the whole petal pink color just

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.380 
like the whole petal pink color just
around<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.210> edge<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.550> spreading<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:08.360> the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
around the edge is it spreading in the

water I've laid down a thicker page with
a<00:04:14.720> bit<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:14.900> cerulean<00:04:15.320> in<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:16.370> make<00:04:16.550> the<00:04:16.760> vein

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
a bit of cerulean in to make the vein

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:26.040 
a bit of cerulean in to make the vein
which<00:04:18.110> you<00:04:18.230> can't<00:04:18.470> see<00:04:18.530> myself<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.209> one<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
which you can't see myself on this one I
