00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.280 

I<00:01:39.700> think<00:01:40.700> it's<00:01:40.820> quite<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.060> shocking<00:01:41.480> sight<00:01:42.140> of

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
I think it's quite a shocking sight of

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.810 
I think it's quite a shocking sight of
the<00:01:42.380> time<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:42.920> think<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.160> decision<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.730> him

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
the time so I think the decision to him

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.910 
the time so I think the decision to him
to<00:01:43.940> be<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> panel<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.690> correct<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.680> it

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
to be on the panel is correct because it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.950 
to be on the panel is correct because it
gives<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.130> good<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.490> chance<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:47.090> argue<00:01:47.630> in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
gives a good have a chance to argue in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.210 
gives a good have a chance to argue in
there<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.320> hopefully<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.040> his

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
there and hopefully see that his

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.450 
there and hopefully see that his
position<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.150> amenable<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.380> just<00:01:51.680> well<00:01:52.040> we

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
position is amenable we just well we

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.880 
position is amenable we just well we
apply<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.030> their<00:01:53.270> show<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.410> weeks<00:01:54.710> ago
