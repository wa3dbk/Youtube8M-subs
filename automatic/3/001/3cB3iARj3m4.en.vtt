00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
unity tutorial and by far this is

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.250 
unity tutorial and by far this is
probably<00:00:08.940> gonna<00:00:09.059> be<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.179> quickest<00:00:09.690> tutorial

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
probably gonna be the quickest tutorial

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.370 
probably gonna be the quickest tutorial
all<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.710> gonna<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.370> set<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:11.940> stuff

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
all we're gonna do is set up some stuff

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.930 
all we're gonna do is set up some stuff
and<00:00:13.380> actually<00:00:13.920> end<00:00:14.099> our<00:00:14.250> game<00:00:14.460> because<00:00:14.610> right

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and actually end our game because right

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.620 
and actually end our game because right
now<00:00:15.089> some<00:00:15.960> people<00:00:16.230> will<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.410> like<00:00:16.560> oh<00:00:16.710> whoa

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
now some people will be like oh whoa

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.910 
now some people will be like oh whoa
well<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.869> happened<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.439> thought<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> game

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
well what happened I thought the game

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
well what happened I thought the game
should<00:00:20.130> end<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.210> maybe<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.020> ball

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
should end right now but maybe the ball

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.310 
should end right now but maybe the ball
might<00:00:22.590> come<00:00:22.890> back<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> Phoenix<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.510> destroy

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
might come back as a Phoenix and destroy

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
might come back as a Phoenix and destroy
all<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> bricks<00:00:26.510> well<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.599> could<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.810> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
all the bricks well we could have that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570 
all the bricks well we could have that
happen<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.980> aren't<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.250> waste<00:00:29.429> our

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
happen but we aren't gonna waste our

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
happen but we aren't gonna waste our
time<00:00:29.640> coding<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.630> stuff<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.170> we're

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
time coding all that stuff all we're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
time coding all that stuff all we're
gonna<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.650> add<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> simple<00:00:32.219> game<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
gonna do is add a simple game over to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.410 
gonna do is add a simple game over to
our<00:00:33.930> ball<00:00:34.110> object<00:00:34.739> script<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> ball<00:00:36.030> script

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
our ball object script or a ball script

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.360 
our ball object script or a ball script
I<00:00:36.570> should<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.110> our<00:00:37.290> object<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:37.920> let's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I should say not our object but let's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
I should say not our object but let's
open<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> guy<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.899> we're<00:00:40.020> gonna<00:00:40.079> do

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
open that guy up and what we're gonna do

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
open that guy up and what we're gonna do
actually<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.940> ball<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.390> below<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
actually is if the ball is below a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.950 
actually is if the ball is below a
certain<00:00:43.170> line<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.340> Y<00:00:44.550> position<00:00:45.030> we're

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
certain line and the Y position we're

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840 
certain line and the Y position we're
just<00:00:46.079> gonna<00:00:46.170> end<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> game<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.129> let's<00:00:47.640> jump

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
just gonna end the game so let's jump

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
just gonna end the game so let's jump
into<00:00:48.059> our<00:00:48.090> ball<00:00:48.329> script<00:00:48.660> create<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.260> new

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
into our ball script create a new

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
into our ball script create a new
function<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.579> end<00:00:50.879> our<00:00:51.059> game<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
function that's gonna end our game so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.889 
function that's gonna end our game so
let's<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.230> name<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.440> game<00:00:52.890> over

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
let's just name it game over

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.580 
let's just name it game over
pretty<00:00:54.920> pretty<00:00:55.920> creative<00:00:56.520> name<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
pretty pretty creative name there and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
pretty pretty creative name there and
within<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> game<00:00:58.890> room<00:00:59.039> function<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.760> we're

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
within the game room function all we're

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.299 
within the game room function all we're
gonna<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> tutorial<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> said

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
gonna do for this tutorial like I said

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
gonna do for this tutorial like I said
it's<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:03.000> quick<00:01:03.210> tutorial

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it's going to be a pretty quick tutorial

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.850 
it's going to be a pretty quick tutorial
is<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.110> refer<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.710> application

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
is we're gonna refer to that application

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.300 
is we're gonna refer to that application
and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.760> we're<00:01:05.880> gonna<00:01:05.970> load<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> level<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
and then we're gonna load the level of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then we're gonna load the level of
menu<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:11.880> simple

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
menu so pretty simple

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
menu so pretty simple
one<00:01:12.960> line<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> code<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.400> we're<00:01:14.520> gonna

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
one line of code that's all we're gonna

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
one line of code that's all we're gonna
do<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.600> game<00:01:16.049> over<00:01:16.320> function<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.770> never

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do but this game over function is never

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
do but this game over function is never
gonna<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.400> called<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> less<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> our<00:01:18.390> ball<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
gonna get called and less of our ball is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
gonna get called and less of our ball is
well<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.950> never<00:01:20.159> gonna<00:01:20.369> get

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
well right now it's never gonna get

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
well right now it's never gonna get
called<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
called so you have to have a way that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
called so you have to have a way that
we're<00:01:22.409> gonna<00:01:22.470> call<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> function<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.549> we're

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
we're gonna call this function and we're

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
we're gonna call this function and we're
going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.060> within<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> update

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
going to do that within the update

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
going to do that within the update
method<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.710> gonna<00:01:25.799> relate<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
method we're gonna relate to the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
method we're gonna relate to the
transform<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.509> our<00:01:27.750> ball<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.619> we're<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.829> say

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
transform of our ball so we're gonna say

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.289 
transform of our ball so we're gonna say
again<00:01:29.430> transform<00:01:30.650> what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> always<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
again transform what I always do that

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.190 
again transform what I always do that
transform<00:01:33.299> dot<00:01:34.049> position<00:01:34.970> dot<00:01:35.970> y<00:01:36.360> we're<00:01:37.110> gonna

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
transform dot position dot y we're gonna

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
transform dot position dot y we're gonna
say<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> Y<00:01:37.799> position<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.549> less<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.299> let's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
say if the Y position is less than let's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
say if the Y position is less than let's
say<00:01:40.049> negative<00:01:40.409> 15<00:01:41.189> something<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
say negative 15 something like that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.679 
say negative 15 something like that
depending<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.680> big<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.399> game<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
depending on how big your game is or the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
depending on how big your game is or the
size<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.490> game<00:01:47.729> screen<00:01:48.060> it's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
size of you know your game screen it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
size of you know your game screen it's
