00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.790 
going on here is I changed replaced out
a<00:00:15.210> proportioning<00:00:15.900> valve<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.379> vehicle

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
a proportioning valve in this vehicle

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.779 
a proportioning valve in this vehicle
and<00:00:17.869> now<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> need<00:00:19.079> to<00:00:19.289> bleed<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.859> brakes<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and now I need to bleed the brakes and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.829 
and now I need to bleed the brakes and
this<00:00:21.230> bleeder<00:00:22.230> valve<00:00:22.499> here<00:00:23.009> as<00:00:23.249> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.489> see

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
this bleeder valve here as you can see

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.639 
this bleeder valve here as you can see
is<00:00:24.919> stripped<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.239> corroded<00:00:28.169> and<00:00:28.560> rusted

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
is stripped it was corroded and rusted

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.859 
is stripped it was corroded and rusted
and<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.489> of<00:00:29.640> stripped<00:00:29.849> before<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.179> started<00:00:30.720> it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and kind of stripped before I started it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
and kind of stripped before I started it
and<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.679> worse<00:00:31.949> by<00:00:32.250> trying<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and then I made it worse by trying to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.209 
and then I made it worse by trying to
get<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> off<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.559> he<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.769> a<00:00:34.829> technique

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
get it off so and he use a technique

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.660 
get it off so and he use a technique
here<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.469> grind<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:38.420> flat<00:00:40.280> see<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.489> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
here to grind this off flat see if I get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
here to grind this off flat see if I get
enough<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.359> flat<00:00:42.600> enough<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.019> that<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.260> can

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
enough get it flat enough so that I can

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
enough get it flat enough so that I can
get<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.820> get<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> better<00:00:45.030> grip<00:00:45.269> with<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.480> set<00:00:45.660> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
get to get a better grip with a set of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.849 
get to get a better grip with a set of
vise<00:00:45.870> grips<00:00:46.109> because<00:00:46.199> it's<00:00:46.440> basically

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
vise grips because it's basically

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.549 
vise grips because it's basically
rounded<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.670> obviously<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:52.019> want<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
rounded now and obviously you want to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.079 
rounded now and obviously you want to
have<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.910> vehicle<00:00:54.679> jacked<00:00:55.679> up<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.190> stands<00:00:56.640> or

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
have the vehicle jacked up on stands or

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.599 
have the vehicle jacked up on stands or
blocked<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.929> blocked<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.769> couple

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
blocked I have it blocked a couple

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.060 
blocked I have it blocked a couple
different<00:01:00.030> places<00:01:00.530> jack<00:01:01.530> still<00:01:01.769> in<00:01:01.859> place

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
different places jack still in place

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
different places jack still in place
with<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.339> weights<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.909> jack<00:01:03.120> because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
with the weights off the jack because

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.730 
with the weights off the jack because
there<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.749> in<00:01:03.839> case<00:01:03.870> something<00:01:05.270> fails<00:01:06.740> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there just in case something fails so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
there just in case something fails so
make<00:01:08.670> sure<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.910> got<00:01:09.000> everything<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.450> safely

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
make sure you got everything all safely

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.930 
make sure you got everything all safely
blocked<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.350> before<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> try<00:01:11.610> something<00:01:11.790> like

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
blocked up before you try something like

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.660 
blocked up before you try something like
this<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.050> I'm<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.410> use<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.620> mini<00:01:14.250> grinder

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this so I'm going to use a mini grinder

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.990 
this so I'm going to use a mini grinder
to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:16.460> if<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> try<00:01:17.940> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to do this if you're going to try it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
to do this if you're going to try it
with<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.150> mini<00:01:18.360> grinder<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.230> file<00:01:19.530> would

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
with a mini grinder of just a file would

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
with a mini grinder of just a file would
be<00:01:20.400> good<00:01:20.670> too<00:01:20.910> but<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.080> key<00:01:22.230> is<00:01:22.410> you're<00:01:22.620> going

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
be good too but the key is you're going

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
be good too but the key is you're going
to<00:01:22.800> take<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.240> don't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to take your time and you just you don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
to take your time and you just you don't
want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> cut<00:01:24.750> through<00:01:25.050> that<00:01:25.350> leader<00:01:26.220> valve

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
want to cut through that leader valve

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
want to cut through that leader valve
you<00:01:26.760> just<00:01:26.940> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.290> give<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.500> bit<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.770> a

you just want to give it a bit of a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.040 
you just want to give it a bit of a
straight<00:01:29.730> edge<00:01:29.910> onto<00:01:30.180> something<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.690> was<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
straight edge onto something it was at a

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.110 
straight edge onto something it was at a
vice<00:01:31.260> grips<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.980> make<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.430> gloves<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
because there's going to be little small

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.020 
because there's going to be little small
little<00:01:40.110> filings<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.220> metal<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.610> everywhere

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
little filings of metal going everywhere

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
little filings of metal going everywhere
so<00:01:42.330> just<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:42.930> time<00:01:43.080> okay<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:43.860> now

hopefully<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.760> can<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.120> that<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.120> top

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
hopefully you can see that I got the top

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.570 
hopefully you can see that I got the top
of<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.420> bleeder<00:01:48.600> screw<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.280> bottom

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
of the bleeder screw and the bottom

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.670 
of the bleeder screw and the bottom
flattened<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.150> enough<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.260> I<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> get

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
flattened off enough so that I can get

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.660 
flattened off enough so that I can get
at<00:01:53.670> least<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:55.100> friction<00:01:56.100> happening

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
at least get a bit of friction happening

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.410 
at least get a bit of friction happening
there<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> set<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.050> vise<00:01:58.200> grips<00:01:59.360> okay<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
there with the set of vise grips okay so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.610 
there with the set of vise grips okay so
I<00:02:00.660> very<00:02:01.290> carefully<00:02:01.650> applied<00:02:02.280> pressure<00:02:02.670> after

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
I very carefully applied pressure after

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.180 
I very carefully applied pressure after
to<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.740> wrench<00:02:04.950> after<00:02:06.800> flattening<00:02:07.800> off<00:02:07.950> those

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to the wrench after flattening off those

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.999 
to the wrench after flattening off those
edges<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.289> felt<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
edges and if it felt like was going to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
edges and if it felt like was going to
break<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.490> have<00:02:11.580> stopped<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.120> tried

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
break I would have stopped and tried

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.120 
break I would have stopped and tried
another<00:02:13.110> plan<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.650> hopefully<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
another plan but hopefully can see this

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.170 
another plan but hopefully can see this
as<00:02:16.030> they<00:02:16.210> turn<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.820> see<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
as they turn this now you can see that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.760 
as they turn this now you can see that
that<00:02:20.010> leader<00:02:21.010> screw<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.580> actually<00:02:22.500> moving<00:02:23.500> now

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that leader screw is actually moving now

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.900 
that leader screw is actually moving now
so<00:02:23.980> I'll<00:02:24.100> remove<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.680> put<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:27.490> new<00:02:27.670> one<00:02:27.790> in

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
so I'll remove that and put a new one in

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
so I'll remove that and put a new one in
and<00:02:29.220> that's<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> end<00:02:30.460> of<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> video
