centimeters long and the other 180
centimeters<00:00:13.679> long<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:15.560> I<00:00:16.880> just<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.029> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
centimeters long and I just want to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.230 
centimeters long and I just want to
start<00:00:18.390> by<00:00:18.779> finding<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.949> center<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.550> each<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
start by finding the center of each of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.960 
start by finding the center of each of
those<00:00:21.359> pieces<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> lay<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
those pieces and then I want to lay the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.580 
those pieces and then I want to lay the
shorter<00:00:24.390> piece<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.930> top<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.490> longer<00:00:26.820> piece

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
shorter piece on top of the longer piece

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.700 
shorter piece on top of the longer piece
so<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> longer<00:00:29.010> piece<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> behind<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.590> then<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so the longer piece is behind and then I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
so the longer piece is behind and then I
want<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> bring<00:00:32.640> those<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.390> outer<00:00:33.690> strands

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
want to bring those two outer strands

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.799 
want to bring those two outer strands
into<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> center<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:38.629> then<00:00:41.120> cross<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.480> right

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
into the center and then cross the right

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.580 
into the center and then cross the right
over<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.690> look<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
over the left so we look like that and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.520 
over the left so we look like that and
then<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.010> set<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.670> loop<00:00:50.940> size<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.840> on

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
then I can set my loop size up here on

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.830 
then I can set my loop size up here on
that<00:00:52.920> loop<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.760> about<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> centimeter<00:00:55.460> or<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.229 

and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> try<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
and I want to try and get this

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.749 
and I want to try and get this
reasonably<00:01:03.239> tight

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.570 

I'm<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.340> second<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> last

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I'm going to take this second to last

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
I'm going to take this second to last
strand<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.540> left-hand<00:01:13.229> side<00:01:15.409> around<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
strand on the left-hand side around the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:33.270 
strand on the left-hand side around the
back<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.640> over<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.360> center<00:01:24.570> again

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.780 

and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.960> want<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.260> take<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
and then I want to take the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.410 
and then I want to take the
second-to-last<00:01:37.530> left-hand<00:01:38.530> strand<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.420> want

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
second-to-last left-hand strand I want

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.110 
second-to-last left-hand strand I want
to<00:01:40.540> take<00:01:40.720> that<00:01:40.930> around<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.440> back<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.120> then

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
to take that around the back and then

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.359 
to take that around the back and then
over<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:43.900> strands<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:47.020> then<00:01:47.229> into<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.770> center

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.219 

just<00:01:51.369> pull<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.850> through<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:53.080> your

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
just pull that through so that your

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.800 
just pull that through so that your
strands<00:01:53.560> don't<00:01:53.830> get<00:01:53.979> tangled<00:01:54.369> up<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:57.690> then<00:01:58.690> I

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
strands don't get tangled up and then I

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.050 
strands don't get tangled up and then I
just<00:01:58.840> want<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.500> take<00:01:59.710> this<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:02.070> under<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
just want to take this one under the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.270 
just want to take this one under the
very<00:02:04.300> left<00:02:04.570> hand<00:02:04.780> strand<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.440> over<00:02:05.860> into<00:02:06.040> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
very left hand strand and over into the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.250 
very left hand strand and over into the
center<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.910> braid<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.390> set<00:02:10.720> we<00:02:11.020> can

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
center now that the braid is set we can

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.530 
center now that the braid is set we can
sort<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.130> keep<00:02:12.370> repeating<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:13.060> process

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
sort of just keep repeating this process

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.810 
sort of just keep repeating this process
we<00:02:14.080> start<00:02:14.410> with<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> second-to-last<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.730> the

we start with the second-to-last on the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.710 
we start with the second-to-last on the
right<00:02:16.440> go<00:02:17.440> under<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:19.739> over<00:02:20.739> two<00:02:21.600> into<00:02:22.600> the

right go under one over two into the
center<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:25.000> continuing<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
center and then continuing with the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
strand under one back into the center

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.650 
strand under one back into the center
and<00:02:35.880> again<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.180> start<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.570> the

and then under over one try your best to

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.089 
and then under over one try your best to
keep<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.420> braid<00:02:55.750> as<00:02:55.989> tight<00:02:56.379> as<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.769> get

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
keep this braid as tight as you can get

into<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.810> center<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:16.439> we'll<00:03:17.439> just<00:03:17.709> keep

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
into the center and we'll just keep

center<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.430> once<00:03:33.579> we<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:33.879> this<00:03:34.030> braid<00:03:34.269> as<00:03:34.450> long

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
center so once we get this braid as long

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.509 
center so once we get this braid as long
as<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.200> again<00:03:35.859> we're<00:03:36.040> going<00:03:36.159> to<00:03:36.250> start

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
as we like again we're going to start

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.149 
as we like again we're going to start
off<00:03:36.670> with<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.120> second<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.170> last<00:03:38.200> strand<00:03:38.859> and

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
off with the second to last strand and

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.470 
off with the second to last strand and
we're<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.519> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.730> come<00:03:39.909> around<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.269> back

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
we're just going to come around the back

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.710 
we're just going to come around the back
and<00:03:40.540> over<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:45.340> should<00:03:45.609> find<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.359> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
and over to and you should find that the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.240 
and over to and you should find that the
center<00:03:47.079> strands<00:03:47.470> cross<00:03:47.739> here<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.280> middle

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
center strands cross here in the middle

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.159 
center strands cross here in the middle
and<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.730> want<00:03:51.879> to<00:03:51.970> take<00:03:52.150> them<00:03:52.419> around<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
and we just want to take them around the

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.879 
and we just want to take them around the
back<00:03:53.579> on<00:03:54.579> one<00:03:54.940> side<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:56.079> other<00:03:58.680> place<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
back on one side and the other place the

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.420 
back on one side and the other place the
bracelet<00:04:00.340> down<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.440> we<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.799> want<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.099> tie<00:04:03.400> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
bracelet down and we just want to tie a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.640 
bracelet down and we just want to tie a
simple<00:04:03.879> half<00:04:04.329> knot<00:04:04.690> on<00:04:04.810> top<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.139> that<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
simple half knot on top of that the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.240 
simple half knot on top of that the
exact<00:04:05.949> same<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:06.970> would<00:04:07.090> tie<00:04:07.389> your<00:04:07.569> shoes

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
exact same as you would tie your shoes

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.569 
exact same as you would tie your shoes
so<00:04:09.250> just<00:04:09.489> go<00:04:09.669> left<00:04:09.970> over<00:04:10.299> right<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:12.150> then

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
so just go left over right and then

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.050 
so just go left over right and then
tighten<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.760> down<00:04:17.459> trying<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.639> keep<00:04:18.849> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
tighten that down trying to keep the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.870 
tighten that down trying to keep the
braid<00:04:20.459> nice<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.729> tight<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.389> then<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:24.669> just

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
braid nice and tight and then we just

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.300 
braid nice and tight and then we just
want<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.240> snip<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.340> singe<00:04:27.340> these<00:04:27.880> outer<00:04:28.330> ends

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
want to snip and singe these outer ends

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.189 
want to snip and singe these outer ends
so<00:04:30.310> I'll<00:04:30.370> snip<00:04:30.669> one<00:04:31.000> side<00:04:31.270> already<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.990> just

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
so I'll snip one side already and I just

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.080 
so I'll snip one side already and I just
wanted<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.590> point<00:04:32.800> out<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:33.159> when<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.460> snip

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
wanted to point out that when you snip

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.070 
wanted to point out that when you snip
these<00:04:34.330> ends<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:35.919> snip<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.610> two<00:04:37.389> or<00:04:37.419> three<00:04:37.539> mil

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
these ends just snip it two or three mil

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.240 
these ends just snip it two or three mil
from<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.530> end<00:04:40.169> before<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.409> singe<00:04:41.800> them<00:04:42.039> and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
from the end before you singe them and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.300 
from the end before you singe them and
then<00:04:44.820> make<00:04:45.820> sure<00:04:45.849> they're<00:04:46.210> melted<00:04:46.979> quite<00:04:47.979> well

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
then make sure they're melted quite well

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.730 
then make sure they're melted quite well
and<00:04:49.289> then<00:04:50.289> when<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.620> press<00:04:50.800> them<00:04:51.099> into<00:04:51.250> place

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.620 

they<00:04:55.740> should<00:04:55.980> spread<00:04:56.370> out<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> little<00:04:56.850> bit<00:04:57.090> and

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
they should spread out a little bit and

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.140 
they should spread out a little bit and
that<00:04:58.470> will<00:04:58.590> just<00:04:58.830> prevent<00:04:59.250> them<00:04:59.460> from<00:04:59.700> pulling

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
that will just prevent them from pulling

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.390 
that will just prevent them from pulling
back<00:05:00.780> through<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.350> knot<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.920> we<00:05:05.040> just<00:05:05.220> need<00:05:05.370> a

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
back through that knot so we just need a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.520 
back through that knot so we just need a
tire<00:05:05.730> but<00:05:06.060> not<00:05:06.360> now<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.930> finish<00:05:07.110> off<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
tire but not now to finish off the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.290 
tire but not now to finish off the
bracelet<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.280> simplest<00:05:08.640> one<00:05:08.880> we<00:05:09.000> can<00:05:09.150> do

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
bracelet and the simplest one we can do

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.530 
bracelet and the simplest one we can do
is<00:05:09.480> just<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.960> simple<00:05:10.640> overhand<00:05:11.640> knot<00:05:11.880> form<00:05:12.420> a

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
is just a simple overhand knot form a

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.390 
is just a simple overhand knot form a
loop<00:05:12.750> then<00:05:13.230> tuck<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.560> ends<00:05:13.920> through<00:05:14.160> that

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
loop then tuck the ends through that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:22.280 
loop then tuck the ends through that
loop<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:16.650> tighten<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.190> up<00:05:20.390> or<00:05:21.390> if<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.020> want<00:05:22.200> to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
loop and tighten it up or if you want to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.710 
loop and tighten it up or if you want to
try<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:23.130> diamond<00:05:23.580> knot<00:05:23.730> which<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:23.970> more<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.600> an

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
try the diamond knot which is more of an

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.560 
try the diamond knot which is more of an
ornamental<00:05:25.380> knot<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.800> it's<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:26.880> bit<00:05:27.060> chunkier

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
ornamental knot and it's a bit chunkier

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.330 
ornamental knot and it's a bit chunkier
so<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.870> holds<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.350> loop<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.830> little<00:05:28.920> bit<00:05:29.190> better

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
so it holds the loop a little bit better

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.110 
so it holds the loop a little bit better
I'll<00:05:29.610> leave<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.000> link<00:05:30.360> up<00:05:31.320> here<00:05:31.400> and<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:33.000> can

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
I'll leave a link up here and you can

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.560 
I'll leave a link up here and you can
learn<00:05:33.300> how<00:05:33.540> to<00:05:33.570> tie<00:05:33.840> this<00:05:34.050> one

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
learn how to tie this one

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.270 
learn how to tie this one
once<00:05:36.570> you've<00:05:36.720> tied<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.260> all<00:05:37.410> but<00:05:37.680> not<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
once you've tied you all but not the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.860 
once you've tied you all but not the
last<00:05:38.490> thing<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:38.820> need<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.000> do<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.630> snip

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
last thing you need to do is just snip

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.200 
last thing you need to do is just snip
and<00:05:40.050> singe<00:05:40.320> these<00:05:40.650> ends<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.190> so<00:05:41.850> we'll<00:05:42.030> just

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
and singe these ends and so we'll just

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.890 
and singe these ends and so we'll just
snip<00:05:42.960> them<00:05:43.140> off<00:05:45.020> use<00:05:46.020> lighter<00:05:47.750> switch<00:05:48.750> them

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
snip them off use lighter switch them

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:57.130 
snip them off use lighter switch them
and<00:05:49.050> then<00:05:49.170> press<00:05:49.470> them<00:05:49.620> into<00:05:49.860> place<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:54.020> then

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.310 

that<00:05:58.140> should<00:05:58.320> be<00:05:58.380> your<00:05:58.620> finished<00:05:58.950> bracelet
