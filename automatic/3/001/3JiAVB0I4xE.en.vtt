which I really need to take a moment to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.220

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
acknowledge because it's definitely

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
acknowledge because it's definitely
different<00:00:40.680> from<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.100> we've<00:00:41.250> come<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.460> expect

kind of sweating a little bit and he's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
kind of sweating a little bit and he's
kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> backed<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> quarries<00:01:16.530> back<00:01:16.680> my

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
kind of backed in the quarries back my

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
kind of backed in the quarries back my
URI<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.000> corner<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
URI back up into a corner and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
URI back up into a corner and
efficiently<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.740> thing<00:01:19.920> leads<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> another

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
efficiently one thing leads to another

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
efficiently one thing leads to another
where<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.970> come<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> find<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.689> my<00:01:21.900> URI

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
where we come to find out that my URI

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
where we come to find out that my URI
has<00:01:22.439> modified<00:01:23.070> his<00:01:23.520> bankai<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.520> guess

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
has modified his bankai and that I guess

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
has modified his bankai and that I guess
it's<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.810> expected<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.220> because

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it's to be expected in some way because

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's to be expected in some way because
I<00:01:29.820> mean<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.659> figure<00:01:30.900> who<00:01:31.229> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
I mean you got to go figure who this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
I mean you got to go figure who this
person<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.220> fight<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.729> mean<00:01:32.880> mayuri's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
person is that's fight I mean mayuri's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
person is that's fight I mean mayuri's
an<00:01:33.720> intelligent<00:01:34.500> person<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.130> he<00:01:35.460> usually

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
an intelligent person and he usually

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.840 
an intelligent person and he usually
uses<00:01:36.060> his<00:01:36.450> science<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.200> crazy<00:01:37.439> shit<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
uses his science do some crazy shit that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.210 
uses his science do some crazy shit that
we<00:01:39.150> never<00:01:39.720> expected<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.740> makes<00:01:40.890> sense<00:01:41.009> how

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we never expected so it makes sense how

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
we never expected so it makes sense how
he<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> modified<00:01:42.090> bankai<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.290> big

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
he has a modified bankai the big

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.370 
he has a modified bankai the big
question<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.720> how<00:01:45.720> long<00:01:46.049> does<00:01:46.320> he

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
question is is like how long does he

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
question is is like how long does he
really<00:01:46.680> had<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.610> long<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
really had this like how long has it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
really had this like how long has it
been<00:01:48.899> modified<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.640> only<00:01:50.759> just

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
been modified but it's not only just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.380 
been modified but it's not only just
that<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> itself<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:53.579> bankai<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that in of itself is the bankai this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.730 
that in of itself is the bankai this
modified<00:01:55.020> bankai<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> work<00:01:56.719> because

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
modified bankai going to work because

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.039 
modified bankai going to work because
judging<00:01:58.740> by<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.509> description<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.780> guess

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
judging by the description like I guess

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.630 
judging by the description like I guess
you<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.740> words<00:02:01.979> at<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> end<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.579> the

there to be a butt attached to the final
part<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.739> chapter<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.700> makes<00:02:20.939> me<00:02:21.090> assume

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
part of this chapter it makes me assume

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.020 
part of this chapter it makes me assume
that<00:02:21.599> whatever<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.129> is<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> hand<00:02:23.879> is

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that whatever is going on is the hand is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.600 
that whatever is going on is the hand is
not<00:02:24.180> down<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.720> hand<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.439> be<00:02:25.620> fine<00:02:25.950> or

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
not down the hand is going to be fine or

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.940 
not down the hand is going to be fine or
take<00:02:27.000> control<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.720> modified<00:02:28.200> bankai

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
take control of the modified bankai

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.559 
take control of the modified bankai
because<00:02:29.400> that's<00:02:29.579> what<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.939> made<00:02:30.060> me<00:02:30.209> assume

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
because that's what it made me assume

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.170 
because that's what it made me assume
but<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> way<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.709> dialogue<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.579> at<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.000> end

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
but the way that dialogue was at the end

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.449 
but the way that dialogue was at the end
of<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.360> chapter<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.739> don't<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
of the chapter so I don't think this

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.819 
of the chapter so I don't think this
fight<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.940> necessarily<00:02:36.569> over<00:02:37.110> yet<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
fight is necessarily over yet and I

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.069 
fight is necessarily over yet and I
don't<00:02:37.860> think<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.329> if<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.930> not

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
don't think it really is and if it's not

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.440 
don't think it really is and if it's not
over<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.129> my<00:02:41.310> aerie<00:02:41.549> going<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> mean

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
you got to think about this I mean if

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
you got to think about this I mean if
