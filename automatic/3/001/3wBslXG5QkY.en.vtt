00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.150
 I came here two years ago, and I went back to school with Richard de Aragues. 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.119
 Edge, you know the Isle of Man TT documentary which is amazing, you know, because we are 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.310
 Walking through, when he was a child, this god, had made such a wonderful movie, so it was 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.100
 A great entry into TT, I think a lot of things I like, you come for the first time 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.970
 Enter your blood here and get all you want to do is come back, all of you know 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.339
 But watching the guy go round is just, it is a cruel game, you know the seniors 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.150
 Today is 6 laps and 2 hours. You know there are a lot of people you say when you go to TT 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.479
 For the first time, it has to blow your mind, can't describe, your experience and 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.439
 Go, okay, make sure, but we went to the front and jumped down, it’s amazing because 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:08.790
 This lady's little place, with concrete walls, is everywhere. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 Then there is the roadside footpath that is only such a high driver. 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.790
 Continue to bomb the past, anyway, let you go through the people's garden, you know your experience 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.710
 Wuliu Garden, although we have a couple to have lunch 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 You just want to hi, anyway, so you end up in this girl's driveway, she gave you a pint 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.190
 Beer and you are sitting there, we are all chatting about walking, some say, sure there is 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 You hear this noise, they come down to Bray Hill and the little right-hander 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.820
 It looks like something, but when you want to be fast, they come, I swear to God 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.750
 You and my place, this away from you and me talk about the back of John McGuiness 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.610
 Wheel 170 (274kph) just screamed, 180 mph (290kph) this is the first time 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.610
 Time, I am shocked in shock, my hand is shaking, I can’t believe myself. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 I just saw it, I just think it's crazy mommy like baby. This is great as a bystander, here too 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.810
 is not it. There are a lot more relaxed. And if you don't mind if I ask, what is the motorcycle? 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.810
 do you love? I don't know, it's fun because my dad and his father never ride a motorcycle. 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.989
 By my mother, no one has ever been riding a motorcycle. I think I can drop it all the way. 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.069
 My teammate Tommy Rockford grew up in Ireland and he has a Maaco, I think this is 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.469
 A MAACO 400 those on a bicycle one day, I convinced him, I am only tiny 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.859
 I convinced him to let me go to the motorcycle and heard about this 2-stroke engine, I am 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.909
 Too small to touch my feet on the ground, so he put me on the bike and insisted on the first 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.049
 Gears and I went to solve this field dozens of times and then fell down, that's it, I fell in love 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.049
 Life, but I think when you drive on a motorcycle, do long distances on the motorcycle, 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 You go to other countries and I think this is a surprising way to use it. Hey, go to Africa. 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.209
 Motorcycles and parked in a village, you are part of the environment, so stop 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.609
 Asking for directions and directions, you are in your own environment, so people who care immediately 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.559
 You are, where are you from, where are you going to be with that kind of thing? 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:27.450
 If the Land Rover or Jeep stops you must get your environment 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.709
 In their environment, you are already deleted, so I think your experience is on the motorcycle 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 More abundant, it is difficult, when it rains, it rains, the surface is dusty when you 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.329
 Really think, I just like it, can not think of something better.
