just because you're very young doesn't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.580 
just because you're very young doesn't
mean<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:03.440> don't<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> sense<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.160> humor

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.410 

people<00:02:09.590> often<00:02:09.890> ask<00:02:10.069> me<00:02:10.160> what<00:02:10.579> comes<00:02:10.789> first<00:02:11.150> the

words<00:02:11.689> or<00:02:12.079> the<00:02:12.170> drawings<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.430> answer<00:02:13.760> is

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
words or the drawings and the answer is

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:14.930

yes

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240

because<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.750> both<00:02:15.960> simultaneously<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250

just<00:02:19.590> getting<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> character<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
just getting to know a character and I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.240 
just getting to know a character and I
doodle<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.750> character<00:02:22.350> over<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.980> over

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
again and they start to come to life and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.280 
again and they start to come to life and
sometimes<00:02:25.890> those<00:02:26.610> drawings<00:02:27.030> create<00:02:27.750> words<00:02:28.050> in

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
sometimes those drawings create words in

my<00:02:28.410> mind<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.860> sometimes<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.430> way<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.610> write

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
