00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
but you know them Chinese people they

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.440 
but you know them Chinese people they

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
kind of throw up the silverware drawer

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
kind of throw up the silverware drawer
and<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.649> gets<00:00:40.920> named

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and that's how this gets named

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
and that's how this gets named
whatever<00:00:41.550> sound<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> makes<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.750> hits<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
whatever sound it makes when it hits the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
whatever sound it makes when it hits the
ground<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.680> guess<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.329> was

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
ground so I guess this one when they was

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
ground so I guess this one when they was
naming<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:46.020> bikes<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.649> must<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.190> made<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
naming these bikes that must have made a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.540 
naming these bikes that must have made a
chin<00:00:47.700> yang<00:00:47.969> sound<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> hit<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> ground

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
chin yang sound when it hit the ground

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
chin yang sound when it hit the ground
but<00:00:53.570> kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.750> funky<00:00:55.199> neat<00:00:55.410> descent<00:00:55.980> shift

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

for one of these a little bit better
than<00:03:29.689> average<00:03:29.810> actually<00:03:31.659> still<00:03:32.659> got<00:03:32.780> the

than average actually still got the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.729 
than average actually still got the
Kickstarter<00:03:33.409> to<00:03:36.670> almost<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.879> little<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.739> believe

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
Kickstarter to almost a little I believe

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:48.959 
Kickstarter to almost a little I believe
that's<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.569> 750<00:03:42.310> yeah<00:03:43.310> that's<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.730> 750<00:03:47.499> but

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:48.969 
that's the 750 yeah that's the 750 but

that's the 750 yeah that's the 750 but
he's<00:03:49.969> got<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.769> guess<00:03:51.769> he's<00:03:51.950> trying<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.340> sell<00:03:52.579> it

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
he's got I guess he's trying to sell it

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.649 
he's got I guess he's trying to sell it
he<00:03:52.819> didn't<00:03:53.030> want<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.269> keep<00:03:53.419> it<00:03:53.540> in<00:03:53.629> his
