00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
where you can go to the really cool

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.479 
where you can go to the really cool
stuff<00:01:55.110> which<00:01:55.380> we'll<00:01:55.860> show<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.039> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> video

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
stuff which we'll show you in the video

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.600 
stuff which we'll show you in the video
like<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.659> autumn<00:01:58.170> app<00:01:58.319> isn't<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.369> big

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
like the autumn app isn't so big

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.339 
like the autumn app isn't so big
actually<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.420> probably<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:01.020> real

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
actually there's probably more real

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.319 
actually there's probably more real
areas<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.099> we<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.429> can't<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> from

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
areas that we just can't get to from

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.510 
areas that we just can't get to from
this<00:02:03.599> brief<00:02:03.840> maybe<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.709> we<00:02:04.860> try<00:02:05.039> breaching<00:02:05.429> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this brief maybe if we try breaching in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
this brief maybe if we try breaching in
another<00:02:05.759> corner<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
another corner and actually get out you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.539 
another corner and actually get out you
can<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:08.910> more<00:02:09.690> real<00:02:09.959> areas<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.340> led

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
can get two more real areas but this led

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.369 
can get two more real areas but this led
you're<00:02:11.790> hoping<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.180> real<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.599> try<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.110> walk

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
you're hoping this real just try to walk

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're hoping this real just try to walk
along<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.769> light<00:02:13.890> over<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.370> other<00:02:14.400> roof

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
along the light over to that other roof

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.180 
along the light over to that other roof
over<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.329> sadly<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.930> fake<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.099> then

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
over there but sadly it's fake and then

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.420 
over there but sadly it's fake and then
right<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.579> thought<00:02:17.760> an<00:02:18.120> office<00:02:18.810> -

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
right here we thought an office -

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.880 
right here we thought an office -
whatever<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.329> Sun<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.530> another

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
whatever but the Sun and this is another

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
whatever but the Sun and this is another
out<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.129> map<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.670> sadly<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.329> cannot<00:02:24.720> swim<00:02:25.109> on

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
out of map that sadly you cannot swim on

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.009 
out of map that sadly you cannot swim on
it<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:27.090> didn't<00:02:27.269> really<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.780> could

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
it we didn't really think you could

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.110 
it we didn't really think you could
really<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.560> there's<00:02:29.160> water<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.790> there's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
really but there's water and there's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.660 
really but there's water and there's
always<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.630> slight<00:02:30.930> possibility<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.280> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
always that slight possibility but this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.660 
always that slight possibility but this
map<00:02:32.850> once<00:02:33.150> again<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.630> cannot<00:02:33.989> swim<00:02:34.489> ahead<00:02:35.489> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
map once again you cannot swim ahead I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.789 
map once again you cannot swim ahead I
know<00:02:35.819> but<00:02:36.299> it's<00:02:36.840> still<00:02:36.989> pretty<00:02:37.260> cool<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:37.590> of

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
know but it's still pretty cool out of

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.650 
know but it's still pretty cool out of
map<00:02:37.950> nonetheless

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
map nonetheless

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
map nonetheless
as<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.140> saw<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> preview<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.010> got<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
as you saw in the preview we got on a

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.780 
as you saw in the preview we got on a
roof<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.690> might<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.080> already<00:02:43.670> figured<00:02:44.670> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
roof you might have already figured it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.580 
roof you might have already figured it
out<00:02:44.910> from<00:02:45.150> watching<00:02:45.570> back<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.050> how<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.380> get

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
out from watching back there how to get

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
out from watching back there how to get
on<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.310> will<00:02:47.520> show<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.790> though<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
on it but we will show you though in the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.990 
on it but we will show you though in the
tutorial<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.320> sadly<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.250> bridge<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.850> not

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
tutorial and sadly this bridge is not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.370 
tutorial and sadly this bridge is not
real<00:02:51.240> we<00:02:51.450> were<00:02:51.540> hoping<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.900> could<00:02:51.960> run<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
real we were hoping we could run it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.560 
real we were hoping we could run it
frost<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> whole<00:02:54.240> new<00:02:54.360> area

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
frost it and get to a whole new area

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.400 
frost it and get to a whole new area
over<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.490> it's<00:02:56.490> not<00:02:56.580> real<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
over there but it's not real it's like I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.810 
over there but it's not real it's like I
said<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:58.770> not<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.190> big<00:02:59.370> out<00:02:59.490> here<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.790> mean

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
said it's not that big out here I mean

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.200 
said it's not that big out here I mean
there's<00:03:00.350> still<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.580> decent<00:03:02.580> amount<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
there's still a decent amount and the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.750 
there's still a decent amount and the
roofs<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.690> cool<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.890> whole<00:03:05.460> lot

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
roofs are cool but not that whole lot

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.790 
roofs are cool but not that whole lot
but<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.150> still<00:03:06.180> pretty<00:03:06.480> awesome<00:03:06.660> boots<00:03:07.470> I

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
but it's still pretty awesome boots I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.890 
but it's still pretty awesome boots I
think<00:03:08.400> that's<00:03:08.580> uh<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.300> also<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.600> live

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
think that's uh and there's also a live

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.710 
think that's uh and there's also a live
feed<00:03:10.140> calm<00:03:10.350> down<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:12.270> lunch<00:03:12.450> was<00:03:12.660> amazing

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
feed calm down so the lunch was amazing

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.340 
feed calm down so the lunch was amazing
really<00:03:13.320> big<00:03:13.530> though

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
really big though

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.680 
really big though
then<00:03:15.310> we're<00:03:15.550> actually<00:03:15.670> going<00:03:15.910> for<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> balcony

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
then we're actually going for a balcony

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.510 
then we're actually going for a balcony
but<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.380> turned<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.740> being<00:03:18.100> alleged

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
but then it turned out to being alleged

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.360 
but then it turned out to being alleged
your<00:03:18.820> mats<00:03:19.060> better<00:03:19.330> on<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.280> you'll<00:03:21.280> see

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
your mats better on you but you'll see

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.399 
your mats better on you but you'll see
all<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.090> video<00:03:22.360> I'll<00:03:22.570> show<00:03:22.690> you

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
all this in this video I'll show you

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.380 
all this in this video I'll show you
found<00:03:24.409> this<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.489> actually<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.909> one<00:03:26.150> little

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
found this is actually this one little

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.089 
found this is actually this one little
spot<00:03:26.540> over<00:03:26.720> by<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:27.019> car<00:03:27.319> that's<00:03:27.620> behind<00:03:27.920> me

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
spot over by that car that's behind me

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.240 
spot over by that car that's behind me
right<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:28.549> there's<00:03:29.150> one<00:03:29.299> little<00:03:29.480> spot<00:03:29.780> there

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
right now there's one little spot there

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.350 
right now there's one little spot there
area<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.459> go<00:03:31.579> there<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.879> we<00:03:32.000> don't<00:03:32.150> show

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
area you can go there that we don't show

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.289 
area you can go there that we don't show
but<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:32.629> not<00:03:32.959> very<00:03:33.489> important<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:35.180> guys

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
but that's not very important you guys

that I spawn up on the roof put my tag

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and then I uh I bring my tackle the with

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.490 
and then I uh I bring my tackle the with
me<00:03:47.239> onto<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.599> roof<00:03:47.870> right<00:03:48.019> here<00:03:48.170> which<00:03:48.470> you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
me onto this roof right here which you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.890 
me onto this roof right here which you
just<00:03:48.709> saw<00:03:48.890> me<00:03:48.950> get<00:03:49.189> on<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.609> this<00:03:50.269> is<00:03:50.420> freaking

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
just saw me get on and this is freaking

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.289 
just saw me get on and this is freaking
awesome<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.530> like<00:03:51.890> i<00:03:52.340> think<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.879> first<00:03:53.060> move

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
awesome it's like i think the first move

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.229 
awesome it's like i think the first move
from<00:03:53.450> black<00:03:53.629> ops<00:03:53.810> 2<00:03:54.109> i'm<00:03:54.260> pretty<00:03:54.500> sure<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.799> is

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
from black ops 2 i'm pretty sure it is

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.910 
from black ops 2 i'm pretty sure it is
and<00:03:56.239> then<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.540> guess<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.260> floor<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:57.590> like<00:03:57.680> kind

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
and then I guess the floor is like kind

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.460 
and then I guess the floor is like kind
of<00:03:57.980> faith<00:03:58.250> or<00:03:58.459> something<00:03:58.819> uh<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.870> saw<00:04:00.019> my<00:04:00.200> tag

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
of faith or something uh you saw my tag

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.020 
of faith or something uh you saw my tag
kind<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.799> one<00:04:00.950> beside<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.459> roof<00:04:01.670> right<00:04:01.849> there

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
kind of one beside the roof right there

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.220 
kind of one beside the roof right there
and<00:04:02.120> then<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.420> can't<00:04:02.629> get<00:04:02.720> out<00:04:02.840> over<00:04:03.019> on<00:04:03.139> this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
and then you can't get out over on this

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.680 
and then you can't get out over on this
other<00:04:03.379> new<00:04:03.680> clothes<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.310> guys<00:04:04.459> know<00:04:04.700> then
