00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
water damage at all and what I normally

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.719 
water damage at all and what I normally
do<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:06.110> top<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:10.430> putting<00:01:11.430> them<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.640> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
garbage cans and the reason why I use
these<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.729> spot<00:01:15.030> where<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> store

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
these is just the spot where I store

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
these is just the spot where I store
them<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:17.600> there's<00:01:18.600> other<00:01:18.750> ways<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
them these work there's other ways to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.850 
them these work there's other ways to
store<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> course<00:01:20.689> what<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.780> normally<00:01:21.860> what

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
store it of course what I normally what

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.359 
store it of course what I normally what
I've<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.189> been<00:01:23.490> doing<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:25.170> taking<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.770> strip

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I've also been doing is taking a strip

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.929 
I've also been doing is taking a strip
of<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.640> gorilla<00:01:26.909> tape<00:01:28.220> folding<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> into

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of this gorilla tape folding it into

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.870 
of this gorilla tape folding it into
thirds<00:01:31.909> backwards

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
thirds backwards

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.770 
thirds backwards
ensuring<00:01:34.750> it's<00:01:34.930> down<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> way<00:01:37.509> across

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
ensuring it's down all the way across

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.190 
ensuring it's down all the way across
and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.640> placing<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.299> on<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> inside<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:41.110> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
lip here making sure it's down and then

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.980 
lip here making sure it's down and then
ripping<00:01:47.619> off<00:01:47.710> another<00:01:48.040> piece<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.810> kind<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.869> do

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
ripping off another piece I kind of do

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.389 
ripping off another piece I kind of do
this<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.680> this<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.860> piece<00:01:51.100> at<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.369> time

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
this have to do this a piece at a time

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:00.180 
this have to do this a piece at a time
otherwise<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.860> fold<00:01:58.920> over<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> bunch

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
otherwise it it will fold over a bunch

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.249 
otherwise it it will fold over a bunch
of<00:02:00.250> times<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.610> not<00:02:00.759> not<00:02:01.479> labeling<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.049> very

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
of times and not not labeling it very

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.740 
of times and not not labeling it very
flat<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.759> then<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.119> overlap<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.690> other

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
flat and then you just overlap the other

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.220 
flat and then you just overlap the other
piece<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.080> little<00:02:11.319> bit<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:12.130> here<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:14.050> what

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
piece a little bit right here then what

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
piece a little bit right here then what
I<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.830> clip<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.700> my<00:02:15.730> lid<00:02:17.489> over<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.819> and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
I do is I clip on my lid over that and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.600 
I do is I clip on my lid over that and
then<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.080> tape<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:21.519> edge<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.980> well<00:02:24.250> all

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
then I tape this edge here as well all

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.509 
then I tape this edge here as well all
the<00:02:24.640> way<00:02:24.880> around<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.680> has<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.190> layers<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
the way around so it has two layers of

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.720 
the way around so it has two layers of
duct<00:02:27.850> tape<00:02:27.880> protecting<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.739> TP<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
duct tape protecting the the TP and and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.370 
duct tape protecting the the TP and and
the<00:02:34.000> garbage<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.430> anyway<00:02:36.430> that's<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the garbage can so anyway that's just a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.319 
the garbage can so anyway that's just a
little<00:02:38.380> food<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.650> thought<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.940> you're<00:02:40.120> going

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.280 
without good toilet paper stinks and
what<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.519> would<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.720> didn't<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
what I would do if I didn't have to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.210 
what I would do if I didn't have to
other<00:02:53.410> paper<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.220> probably<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
other paper is I probably do as the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.940 
other paper is I probably do as the
Romans<00:02:57.250> did<00:02:57.970> and<00:03:00.000> use<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.170> moist<00:03:02.170> or<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.530> wet

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
Romans did and use a moist or a wet

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.970 
Romans did and use a moist or a wet
cloth<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.760> wash<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.420> out<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.590> then<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
cloth and then wash it out and then you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.160 
cloth and then wash it out and then you
can<00:03:09.070> reuse<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.109> very

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
can reuse it and that's not very

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.190 
can reuse it and that's not very
pleasant<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.950> think<00:03:12.250> about<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.299> it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
pleasant to think about but it's

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.460 
pleasant to think about but it's
essentially<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.829> same<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:16.140> cloth<00:03:17.140> diaper

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
essentially the same as a cloth diaper

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.009 
essentially the same as a cloth diaper
or<00:03:17.709> something<00:03:18.100> which<00:03:18.329> I'll<00:03:19.329> be<00:03:19.510> covering<00:03:19.810> in

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
or something which I'll be covering in

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.289 
or something which I'll be covering in
the<00:03:20.109> future<00:03:20.440> as<00:03:20.590> well<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:23.579> anyway<00:03:24.579> thanks<00:03:25.239> for

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
the future as well so anyway thanks for

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.850 
the future as well so anyway thanks for
watching<00:03:25.390> and
