00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.580
 a younger boy older than me 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.390
 You understood that you approached me. 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.349

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.089
 past the day of living or sell a bike for him 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.979
 without understanding the moment ahead and did not want to pay this bike 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.190
 That's when I get shot. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.129
 He shot me in the face. 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.339
 that the traffic that I am a monster 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 only this time the world dies 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.539
 the second time was another group too 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.699
 where we tried to hold it in the region 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.279
 here more people come and kill me said 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.199
 high and tummy storms 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.249
 is the third 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.589
 third time was when she exposed me pregnant she was already of age mothers 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.769
 by the past I used to live in the area 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.009
 just understood 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.739
 the boy who 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.619
 From my past I was angry with myself. 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.909
 ended up getting me a boite where ine gave three children 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.489
 I fell off the bike 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.489
 followed by the first cycle 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.409
 for having escaped from death and kleberson considers himself a lucky person 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.569
 but he recognizes 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.189
 He's just in prison. 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.359
 because of the involvement he had with bad companies still in their teens 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.439
 I came to stop here in the penal institute other companies again 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.619
 understood my mother 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:32.889
 always took me with a good way 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.769
 I always try to get the young people right 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.069
 by stressful newspaper invitation 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.559
 invited me 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:46.489

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.579
 where to find police that is the odor 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.749
 without understanding why 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.230

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.769
 only I was arrested 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.589
 in this area 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:02.169
 but it was the fact that you stopped at the jerome booth barrier that's always looking for 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:02.919
 price 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.799
 No, sir, the bike was stolen. 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.680
 the bike that the Pope was broken 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.739
 It pays to be expensive on this bike 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.109
 this bike was stolen and he knows and he ran away 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.979
 and I ended up staying 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.400
 but stopped there 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.559

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.340
 was forced to participate in one of them 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.879

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.249

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.889
 understand how you get rid of them 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.840
 I already lived there yesterday. 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.630

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.439
 leave home 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.900
 You're basically forced to live with yourself.

 yes yes an official match one hour there neighborhood girls 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.559
 You have to use 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.469
 to live with it otherwise you are under pressure from them 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.009
 it was a body 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.080

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.499

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.279
 situated in none of them 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.039

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.240
 to you and will suffer the consequences 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.020

 the sequencing of death including dying 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.969
 the register is already about to receive the benefit of fulfilling the penalty that was 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.259
 you really have to impose 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.479
 but the young age celebrated the decision of justice he is accused of having 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.589
 participated in a murder 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.739
 a crime which, according to Kleberson, because he thinks he did not commit this homicide 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:58.449

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.080
