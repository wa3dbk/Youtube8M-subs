and<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.850> tutorial<00:00:06.000> we're<00:00:06.509> gonna<00:00:06.600> be

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
and in this tutorial we're gonna be

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.410 
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
working<00:00:07.020> more<00:00:07.200> on<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.470> card<00:00:08.069> program<00:00:08.550> now<00:00:09.179> if

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
working more on the card program now if

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.850 
working more on the card program now if
you<00:00:09.510> don't<00:00:09.719> understand<00:00:10.440> what<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.679> see

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
you don't understand what you see

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.129 
you don't understand what you see
already<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.730> my<00:00:11.849> screen<00:00:12.150> then<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.809> might<00:00:12.960> want

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
already on my screen then you might want

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.720 
already on my screen then you might want
to<00:00:13.170> go<00:00:13.290> ahead<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.799> move<00:00:14.040> back<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> couple<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
to go ahead and move back a couple of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
to go ahead and move back a couple of
tutorials<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.389> start<00:00:15.599> from<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> beginning

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
tutorials and start from the beginning

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.210 
tutorials and start from the beginning
of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.650> card<00:00:17.240> car<00:00:18.240> program<00:00:18.449> tutorials<00:00:19.220> okay

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of the card car program tutorials okay

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010 
of the card car program tutorials okay
so<00:00:20.279> now<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> way

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so now that I got that out of the way

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
so now that I got that out of the way
let's<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:22.740> ahead<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.220> add<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> constructor<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
let's go ahead and add a constructor and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040 
let's go ahead and add a constructor and
a<00:00:25.410> another<00:00:26.090> method<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.510> use<00:00:27.689> inside

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a another method that we can use inside

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
a another method that we can use inside
of<00:00:28.170> our<00:00:28.289> car<00:00:28.500> class<00:00:28.740> now<00:00:29.340> these<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.670> all

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of our car class now these are all

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
of our car class now these are all
essential<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> be

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
essential because we're going to be

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.040 
essential because we're going to be
using<00:00:32.160> those<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:33.149> other<00:00:33.360> classes<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
using those in other classes that we

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
using those in other classes that we
make<00:00:34.399> by<00:00:35.399> using<00:00:35.460> inheritance<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> let's<00:00:38.309> go

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
make by using inheritance so let's go

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
make by using inheritance so let's go
ahead<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.899> simple<00:00:41.510> method<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
ahead and just make a simple method that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500 
ahead and just make a simple method that
will<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> function<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.340> will<00:00:44.940> tell<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
will or a function that will tell if the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.619 
will or a function that will tell if the
car<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.870> moving<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.879> common<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.360> so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
car is moving so what is common this so

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.790 
car is moving so what is common this so
is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.829> car<00:00:50.100> moving<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.860> we'll<00:00:52.860> type<00:00:53.210> public

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
is the car moving and we'll type public

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.020 
is the car moving and we'll type public
function<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.780> moving<00:00:58.609> it's<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.820> going<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
function is moving it's not going to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.369 
function is moving it's not going to
accept<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.480> arguments<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.230> don't

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
accept any arguments because we don't

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.039 
accept any arguments because we don't
need<00:01:01.500> any<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.570> boolean

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
need any and we will make it a boolean

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
need any and we will make it a boolean
type<00:01:04.339> because<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.670> car<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> either<00:01:06.330> moving<00:01:06.630> or

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
type because the car is either moving or

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
type because the car is either moving or
it's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.260> moving<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> simple<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.670> now

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it's not moving it's that simple so now

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.130 
it's not moving it's that simple so now
I'm<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> test<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.880> test<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> speed<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I'm going to test if test the speed so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.410 
I'm going to test if test the speed so
if<00:01:15.049> speed<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:16.950> accessing<00:01:17.420> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
if speed and we are accessing the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
if speed and we are accessing the
property<00:01:19.049> speed<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
property speed right here so and this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550 
property speed right here so and this
uses<00:01:23.460> what's<00:01:23.700> called<00:01:23.759> indirection<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.439> where

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
uses what's called indirection to where

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.880 
uses what's called indirection to where
we're<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:26.030> accessing<00:01:27.030> this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
we're not actually accessing this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.899 
we're not actually accessing this
variable<00:01:28.890> directly<00:01:29.130> we're<00:01:29.549> using<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
variable directly we're using this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.130 
variable directly we're using this
property<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.759> speed<00:01:33.270> equals<00:01:33.689> zero<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
property so if speed equals zero and if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.929 
property so if speed equals zero and if
that<00:01:34.259> confuses<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.549> indirection

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that confuses you the indirection

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.530 
that confuses you the indirection
concept<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:38.460> I'll<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> talking<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
concept then I'll be talking about it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.789 
concept then I'll be talking about it
later<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> you've<00:01:40.290> already<00:01:40.409> been<00:01:40.619> using

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
later on and you've already been using

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
later on and you've already been using
it<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.280> throughout<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.729> programs<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it a lot throughout your programs so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
it a lot throughout your programs so
it'll<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.439> easy<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.680> understand<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it'll be easy on understand what you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
it'll be easy on understand what you
grasp<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> concept<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.079> you've<00:01:46.229> used<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
grasp the concept because you've used it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.160 
grasp the concept because you've used it
a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.909> speed<00:01:48.119> equals<00:01:48.390> zero<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a lot so it's speed equals zero then

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
a lot so it's speed equals zero then
what<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.970> want<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.210> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
what do we want to do we want to just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.230 
what do we want to do we want to just
simply<00:01:51.750> return<00:01:52.200> false

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
simply return false

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
simply return false
now<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.509> speed<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> anything<00:01:55.350> else<00:01:55.500> other<00:01:55.710> than

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
now if speed is anything else other than

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.940 
now if speed is anything else other than
zero<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.500> ahead<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
zero then we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.850 
zero then we're gonna go ahead and
return<00:01:59.520> true<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.500> moving

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
return true now they can also be moving

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.319 
return true now they can also be moving
at<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:04.130> negative<00:02:05.130> speed<00:02:05.579> we're<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.240> gonna

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
at a negative speed we're just gonna

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.389 
at a negative speed we're just gonna
allow<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.750> let's<00:02:07.680> say<00:02:07.890> they're<00:02:08.190> going

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
allow that let's say they're going

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
allow that let's say they're going
backwards<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.810> technically<00:02:10.349> isn't

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
backwards now this technically isn't

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
backwards now this technically isn't
right<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.750> they're<00:02:12.750> always<00:02:12.930> it's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
right because they're always it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220 
right because they're always it's
possible<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> move<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> negative<00:02:15.180> speed<00:02:15.690> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
possible to move at a negative speed you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.390 
possible to move at a negative speed you
always<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.980> certain<00:02:17.190> speed

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
always have to be going a certain speed

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220 
always have to be going a certain speed
in<00:02:17.550> one<00:02:17.700> direction<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.240> other<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:19.050> for

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
in one direction or the other but for

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.800 
in one direction or the other but for
this<00:02:19.320> program<00:02:19.530> let's<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.220> allow<00:02:20.460> them<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.810> go

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
this program let's just allow them to go

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.440 
this program let's just allow them to go
backwards<00:02:22.260> by<00:02:22.410> using<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.860> negative<00:02:23.040> speed<00:02:23.520> so

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
backwards by using a negative speed so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.750 
backwards by using a negative speed so
if<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.200> anything<00:02:25.440> other<00:02:25.650> than<00:02:25.890> zero<00:02:26.190> we'll

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
if it's anything other than zero we'll

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.640 
if it's anything other than zero we'll
just<00:02:26.940> simply<00:02:27.060> return<00:02:27.360> true<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.840> let's<00:02:31.530> go

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
just simply return true now let's go

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.140 
just simply return true now let's go
ahead<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.100> create<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.940> constructor<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
ahead and create a constructor so that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.310 
ahead and create a constructor so that
whenever<00:02:36.150> somebody<00:02:36.450> creates<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.960> new<00:02:37.080> car

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
whenever somebody creates a new car

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.680 
whenever somebody creates a new car
object<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:38.280> gonna<00:02:38.460> go<00:02:38.610> ahead<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.000> set<00:02:39.480> some

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
object it's gonna go ahead and set some

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.060 
object it's gonna go ahead and set some
of<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:39.870> values<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.560> them<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.950> they

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
of these values for them so that they

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190 
of these values for them so that they
don't<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.520> do<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.720> we'll<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.080> go

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
don't have to do that so we'll just go

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.700 
don't have to do that so we'll just go
ahead<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.620> use<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.130> constructor<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.850> sub<00:02:45.180> new

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
ahead and use the constructor so sub new

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.710 
ahead and use the constructor so sub new
go<00:02:46.710> ahead<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:46.980> enter<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.520> it'll<00:02:47.910> add<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.360> sub

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
go ahead and enter and it'll add in sub

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.800 
go ahead and enter and it'll add in sub
for<00:02:48.960> us<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.830> let's<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.490> ahead<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.000> set

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
for us so let's just go ahead and set

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.290 
for us so let's just go ahead and set
some<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.290> default<00:02:52.890> values<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.550> so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
some of the default values for this so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.450 
some of the default values for this so
we'll<00:02:54.780> set<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.050> color<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.680> speed<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
we'll set the color the speed and the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.730 
we'll set the color the speed and the
number<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.880> doors<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:58.050> color<00:02:59.480> equals<00:03:00.740> let's

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
number of doors so color equals let's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.630 
number of doors so color equals let's
make<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.070> red<00:03:03.410> speed<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> initially

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
make it red speed is going to initially

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.790 
make it red speed is going to initially
be<00:03:05.850> equal<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.270> zero<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:09.480> speed<00:03:10.230> it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
be equal to zero for here in speed it's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.880 
be equal to zero for here in speed it's
gonna<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.040> equal<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.370> zero<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.650> int

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
gonna be equal to zero and then int

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.280 
gonna be equal to zero and then int
number<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.550> doors<00:03:14.790> let's<00:03:15.660> go<00:03:15.810> ahead<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.110> set

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
number of doors let's go ahead and set

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.670 
number of doors let's go ahead and set
that<00:03:16.320> equal<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:17.630> five<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.440> including

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that equal to five and that's including

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560 
that equal to five and that's including
the<00:03:19.920> trunk<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.460> you<00:03:20.550> got<00:03:20.670> four<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.210> then<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
the trunk so you got four and then the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.200 
the trunk so you got four and then the
trunk<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:23.490> that<00:03:23.550> we've<00:03:23.760> created<00:03:23.910> our

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
trunk so now that we've created our

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.930 
trunk so now that we've created our
constructor<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.280> ahead<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.730> head

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
constructor we can go ahead and head

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.780 
constructor we can go ahead and head
back<00:03:27.120> into<00:03:27.360> form<00:03:27.660> 1bb<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.520> under

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
back into form 1bb and you can see under

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.360 
back into form 1bb and you can see under
the<00:03:29.910> form<00:03:30.150> unload<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:31.170> don't<00:03:31.350> have<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the form unload we don't have to set the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.270 
the form unload we don't have to set the
color<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.940> start<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.010> already

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
color to start with because it's already

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.580 
color to start with because it's already
done<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.640> for<00:03:35.700> us<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.300> constructor<00:03:36.870> now

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
done that for us in the constructor now

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.260 
done that for us in the constructor now
if<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.890> want<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.520> go<00:03:38.610> ahead<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.090> add

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
if you want to you can go ahead and add

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.270 
if you want to you can go ahead and add
some<00:03:39.300> arguments<00:03:40.050> for<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> constructor<00:03:40.740> so

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
some arguments for the constructor so

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.220 
some arguments for the constructor so
that<00:03:41.430> when<00:03:41.520> they<00:03:41.610> make<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> new<00:03:42.030> car<00:03:42.240> object<00:03:42.750> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that when they make a new car object it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.570 
that when they make a new car object it
will<00:03:43.320> set<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.830> color<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> speed

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
will set it to the color of the speed

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.270 
will set it to the color of the speed
and<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.910> number<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.270> doors<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.630> they<00:03:45.780> want

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
and the number of doors that they want

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.090 
and the number of doors that they want
so<00:03:47.840> let's<00:03:48.840> come<00:03:48.990> over<00:03:49.080> here<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.350> we'll<00:03:49.890> add<00:03:49.950> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
so let's come over here and we'll add a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.820 
so let's come over here and we'll add a
button<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.850> we'll<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.810> call<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.080> accelerate

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
button and we'll just call it accelerate

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.860 
button and we'll just call it accelerate
so<00:03:55.830> we'll<00:03:56.250> set<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.550> text<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:58.640> accelerate

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.040 

we'll<00:04:02.709> set<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.190> name<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.700> button<00:04:04.270> accelerate

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
we'll set the name to button accelerate

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.190 
we'll set the name to button accelerate
and<00:04:06.000> now<00:04:07.000> I'll<00:04:07.090> go<00:04:07.209> ahead<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.599> access<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and now I'll go ahead and access the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.780 
and now I'll go ahead and access the
click<00:04:08.590> event<00:04:08.620> for<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> just<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:12.400> all<00:04:12.580> of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
click event for that so just like all of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.580 
click event for that so just like all of
the<00:04:12.880> other<00:04:13.060> click<00:04:13.330> events<00:04:13.660> we're<00:04:14.349> going<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> be

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
the other click events we're going to be

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.340 
the other click events we're going to be
using<00:04:14.980> an<00:04:15.160> input<00:04:16.150> box<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:17.410> we'll<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:17.980> type

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
using an input box so we'll just type

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.370 
using an input box so we'll just type
default<00:04:20.350> car

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
default car

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.810 
default car
we're<00:04:23.380> not<00:04:23.500> default<00:04:23.889> back<00:04:24.070> color<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.610> keeps

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
we're not default back color it keeps

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.520 
we're not default back color it keeps
doing<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.240> for<00:04:25.450> me<00:04:25.570> because<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:26.500> not

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
doing that for me because it's not

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.260 
doing that for me because it's not
selected<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.330> default<00:04:28.330> car<00:04:28.570> dot<00:04:29.080> accelerate

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
selected so default car dot accelerate

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.760 
selected so default car dot accelerate
and<00:04:31.270> for<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.780> arguments<00:04:32.230> we're<00:04:32.410> going<00:04:32.650> to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
and for the arguments we're going to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.860 
and for the arguments we're going to
need<00:04:32.889> an<00:04:33.070> integer<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:34.360> what<00:04:34.479> we're<00:04:34.570> gonna<00:04:34.630> do

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
need an integer so what we're gonna do

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.460 
need an integer so what we're gonna do
is<00:04:35.110> we're<00:04:35.440> just<00:04:35.470> going<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:36.060> convert<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.930> string

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
is we're just going to convert a string

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.930 
is we're just going to convert a string
to<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.460> string<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:39.729> we're<00:04:39.850> going

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
to that and the string that we're going

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.750 
to that and the string that we're going
to<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.120> used<00:04:40.360> is<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:41.530> string<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.669> we

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
to be used is the string that is that we

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.640 
to be used is the string that is that we
get<00:04:42.940> from<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> input<00:04:43.330> box<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:45.100> input<00:04:45.460> box

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
get from the input box so input box

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.879 
get from the input box so input box
please<00:04:47.729> enter<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:50.250> speed<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:52.570> miles<00:04:53.440> per<00:04:53.740> hour

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
please enter the speed in miles per hour

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.550 
please enter the speed in miles per hour
to<00:04:54.280> accelerate<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.760> doesn't<00:04:58.090> what<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.300> do

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
to accelerate so this doesn't what to do

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.150 
to accelerate so this doesn't what to do
the<00:04:59.560> title<00:04:59.770> we'll<00:05:00.160> just<00:05:00.340> set<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.669> speed<00:05:01.000> and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
the title we'll just set it to speed and

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.810 
the title we'll just set it to speed and
then<00:05:03.160> we'll<00:05:03.310> leave<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.700> rest<00:05:03.880> as<00:05:04.180> default<00:05:04.630> so

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
then we'll leave the rest as default so

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.210 
then we'll leave the rest as default so
the<00:05:06.820> first<00:05:07.660> argument<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.289> our<00:05:08.470> conversion<00:05:09.039> is

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
the first argument of our conversion is

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.800 
the first argument of our conversion is
going<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.729> be<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.910> string<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.419> get<00:05:10.630> from

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
going to be the string that we get from

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.630 
going to be the string that we get from
the<00:05:10.900> input<00:05:11.050> box<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.919> now<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.220> second

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the input box and now the second

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.159 
the input box and now the second
argument<00:05:12.760> we're<00:05:13.300> going<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.479> convert<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.810> to

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
argument we're going to convert that to

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.440 
argument we're going to convert that to
type<00:05:14.650> integer<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:18.190> now<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:18.940> just<00:05:19.030> need<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.330> make

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
type integer so now I just need to make

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.260 
type integer so now I just need to make
sure<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.990> all<00:05:20.260> of<00:05:20.289> our<00:05:20.910> parentheses<00:05:21.910> line<00:05:22.120> up

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
sure that all of our parentheses line up

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.040 
sure that all of our parentheses line up
so<00:05:22.479> I've<00:05:22.570> got<00:05:22.720> one<00:05:22.900> there<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:24.930> we've<00:05:25.930> got

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
so I've got one there and we've got

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.180 
so I've got one there and we've got
another<00:05:26.410> one<00:05:26.620> right<00:05:26.650> here

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
another one right here

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.170 
another one right here
so<00:05:28.180> we're<00:05:28.300> gonna<00:05:28.390> have<00:05:28.539> to<00:05:28.630> put<00:05:29.460> let's<00:05:30.460> see<00:05:30.760> I

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
so we're gonna have to put let's see I

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.990 
so we're gonna have to put let's see I
think<00:05:31.450> one<00:05:31.870> right<00:05:32.080> there

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
think one right there

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.870 
think one right there
or<00:05:34.000> not<00:05:34.780> let's<00:05:34.960> put<00:05:35.200> one<00:05:35.470> right<00:05:35.979> there<00:05:38.700> ok<00:05:39.700> so

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
or not let's put one right there ok so

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.440 
or not let's put one right there ok so
now<00:05:40.870> that<00:05:40.900> we<00:05:41.110> called<00:05:41.789> accelerate<00:05:42.789> let's<00:05:43.300> just

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
now that we called accelerate let's just

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.210 
now that we called accelerate let's just
go<00:05:43.570> ahead<00:05:43.690> and<00:05:44.050> show<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.729> car<00:05:45.940> info<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:47.770> we'll

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
go ahead and show the car info so we'll

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.440 
go ahead and show the car info so we'll
just<00:05:48.340> type<00:05:48.660> default<00:05:49.660> car<00:05:52.470> dot<00:05:53.470> two<00:05:54.130> string<00:05:54.610> now

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
just type default car dot two string now

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.090 
just type default car dot two string now
I<00:05:55.750> know<00:05:55.870> I'm<00:05:56.110> gonna<00:05:56.200> get<00:05:56.410> a<00:05:56.440> lot<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.680> comments

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
I know I'm gonna get a lot of comments

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.370 
I know I'm gonna get a lot of comments
about<00:05:57.130> this<00:05:57.460> saying<00:05:57.760> like<00:05:58.060> why<00:05:58.930> did<00:05:59.139> you

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
about this saying like why did you

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.219 
about this saying like why did you
override<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.580> string<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.120> do<00:06:01.240> this<00:06:01.419> when<00:06:02.110> you

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
override to string to do this when you

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.870 
override to string to do this when you
could<00:06:02.350> have<00:06:02.380> created<00:06:02.770> your<00:06:02.950> own<00:06:03.010> method<00:06:03.729> that

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
could have created your own method that

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.860 
could have created your own method that
shows<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.680> attributes<00:06:05.680> of<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.889> car<00:06:06.070> well<00:06:06.870> the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
shows the attributes of the car well the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.210 
shows the attributes of the car well the
reason<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.200> did<00:06:08.380> this<00:06:08.500> is<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:08.889> get<00:06:08.979> you<00:06:09.100> some

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
reason I did this is to get you some

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.490 
reason I did this is to get you some
practice<00:06:09.610> with<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:09.880> overrides<00:06:10.390> and<00:06:10.780> because

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
practice with the overrides and because

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.170 
practice with the overrides and because
we're<00:06:12.010> not<00:06:12.130> going<00:06:12.280> to<00:06:12.310> be<00:06:12.430> using<00:06:12.760> to<00:06:12.849> string

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
we're not going to be using to string

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.580 
we're not going to be using to string
anywhere<00:06:13.720> else<00:06:13.870> in<00:06:14.080> our<00:06:14.169> deep

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
anywhere else in our deep

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.800 
anywhere else in our deep
Carr<00:06:14.890> class<00:06:15.340> so<00:06:15.640> if<00:06:15.760> you<00:06:15.850> called<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.270> default

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
Carr class so if you called the default

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.600 
Carr class so if you called the default
card<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.290> string<00:06:17.620> if<00:06:17.860> we<00:06:17.980> didn't<00:06:18.190> override

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
card to string if we didn't override

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.940 
card to string if we didn't override
that<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:20.110> would<00:06:20.260> give<00:06:20.410> us<00:06:20.530> back<00:06:20.710> something

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
that it would give us back something

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.250 
that it would give us back something
that<00:06:21.100> isn't<00:06:21.610> useful<00:06:21.760> to<00:06:22.180> us<00:06:22.330> at<00:06:22.480> all<00:06:22.660> so<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.230> just

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
that isn't useful to us at all so I just

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.440 
that isn't useful to us at all so I just
decided<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.830> override<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:25.030> give<00:06:25.180> us<00:06:25.300> what

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
decided to override it to give us what

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.360 
decided to override it to give us what
we<00:06:25.570> want<00:06:25.600> it's<00:06:26.110> only<00:06:26.260> going<00:06:26.440> to<00:06:26.500> do<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.800> to

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
we want it's only going to do that to

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.900 
we want it's only going to do that to
the<00:06:28.170> class<00:06:29.170> car<00:06:29.500> and<00:06:29.770> anything<00:06:30.220> that<00:06:30.250> inherits

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
the class car and anything that inherits

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:37.370 
the class car and anything that inherits
it<00:06:31.380> so<00:06:32.670> let's<00:06:33.670> go<00:06:33.790> ahead<00:06:34.030> and<00:06:35.730> come<00:06:36.730> back<00:06:36.880> here

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
it so let's go ahead and come back here

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.120 
it so let's go ahead and come back here
and<00:06:38.700> we<00:06:39.700> will<00:06:40.060> run<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:40.780> program<00:06:41.170> and<00:06:41.380> see<00:06:42.100> what

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
and we will run the program and see what

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.860 
and we will run the program and see what
happens<00:06:42.550> so<00:06:44.100> we'll<00:06:45.100> go<00:06:45.190> ahead<00:06:45.220> and<00:06:45.690> we'll<00:06:46.690> set

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
happens so we'll go ahead and we'll set

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.060 
happens so we'll go ahead and we'll set
the<00:06:46.960> name<00:06:47.140> of<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:47.350> car<00:06:47.530> -<00:06:48.430> let's<00:06:49.000> say<00:06:49.180> Honda

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
the name of the car - let's say Honda

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.930 
the name of the car - let's say Honda
CRV<00:06:51.510> so<00:06:52.510> we've<00:06:52.600> got<00:06:52.750> our<00:06:52.780> CRV<00:06:53.520> the<00:06:54.520> color<00:06:54.730> is

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
CRV so we've got our CRV the color is

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.930 
CRV so we've got our CRV the color is
already<00:06:55.300> automatically<00:06:55.810> set<00:06:56.140> and<00:06:56.890> let's<00:06:57.820> go

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
already automatically set and let's go

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.750 
already automatically set and let's go
ahead<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.300> accelerate<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:58.990> by<00:06:59.170> let's<00:06:59.440> say<00:06:59.760> 60

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
ahead and accelerate it by let's say 60

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.810 
ahead and accelerate it by let's say 60
miles<00:07:00.970> per<00:07:01.090> hour<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.660> we'll<00:07:02.560> click<00:07:02.740> OK<00:07:03.040> now<00:07:03.550> if

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
miles per hour and we'll click OK now if

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.420 
miles per hour and we'll click OK now if

and<00:07:12.550> the<00:07:12.850> car<00:07:13.060> speed<00:07:13.420> now<00:07:13.990> we<00:07:14.050> can<00:07:14.260> keep

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
and the car speed now we can keep

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.140 
and the car speed now we can keep
accelerating<00:07:15.100> let's<00:07:15.280> accelerate<00:07:15.790> by<00:07:15.940> another

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150

5<00:07:16.360> miles<00:07:16.630> per<00:07:16.810> hour<00:07:17.970> you<00:07:18.970> can<00:07:19.030> see<00:07:19.270> that<00:07:19.630> it

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
5 miles per hour you can see that it

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.460 
5 miles per hour you can see that it
gives<00:07:20.050> us<00:07:20.320> 65<00:07:20.860> miles<00:07:21.190> per<00:07:21.280> hour<00:07:21.570> ok<00:07:22.570> so<00:07:23.170> before

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
gives us 65 miles per hour ok so before
