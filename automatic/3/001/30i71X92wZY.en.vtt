of the box we can see what other
vehicles<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> line<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.049> then<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
vehicles are in the line and then we can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.299 
vehicles are in the line and then we can
have<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.650> some<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> features<00:01:05.010> so

have a look at some of the features so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
have a look at some of the features so
it<00:01:05.400> does<00:01:05.549> come<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> dropping<00:01:06.570> Bob

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it does come with a dropping Bob

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
it does come with a dropping Bob
mechanism<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.100> holds

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
mechanism which you can see there holds

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.960 
mechanism which you can see there holds
one<00:01:09.119> bell<00:01:09.270> droid<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
one bell droid as you can see and the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
one bell droid as you can see and the
wings<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.450> fold<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.890> depending

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wings can fold up and down so depending

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
wings can fold up and down so depending
on<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> set<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.450> motion

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
on how you want to set it in motion

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.679 
on how you want to set it in motion
so<00:01:16.710> let's<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.040> move<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so let's actually move back to the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
so let's actually move back to the
vehicle<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.299> let's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
vehicle now so here we are here let's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
vehicle now so here we are here let's
start<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> cockpit<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.310> see

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
start in on the cockpit so you can see

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
start in on the cockpit so you can see
there<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> comes<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> nicely<00:01:24.240> painted

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
there it comes with a nicely painted

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
there it comes with a nicely painted
bell<00:01:25.110> droid<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.189> sits<00:01:26.369> quite<00:01:26.549> well

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bell droid and actually sits quite well

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.230

in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> actual<00:01:27.479> seat<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.700> it's<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:29.820> usual

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
in the actual seat so it's pretty usual

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
in the actual seat so it's pretty usual
unusual<00:01:30.840> story<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.259> find<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> figure<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> sits

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
unusual story to find a figure that sits

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
unusual story to find a figure that sits
quite<00:01:32.490> nicely<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.200> seat<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> the

quite nicely in the in the seat of the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.020 
quite nicely in the in the seat of the
vehicle<00:01:34.860> most<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> time<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> legs<00:01:35.850> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
vehicle most of the time the legs don't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.190 
vehicle most of the time the legs don't
sort<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.329> bend<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.780> spot<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
sort of bend in the right spot or the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
sort of bend in the right spot or the
hands<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.650> carry<00:01:37.950> over<00:01:37.979> onto<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> handles

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
hands don't carry over onto the handles

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
hands don't carry over onto the handles
but<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.290> droids<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
but you can see there the droids it's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
but you can see there the droids it's
rather<00:01:41.310> nice<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> even<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> battle<00:01:42.210> pack

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
rather nice to even with the battle pack

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
rather nice to even with the battle pack
on<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.930> they've<00:01:43.079> even<00:01:43.229> allowed<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
on and they've even allowed for that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
on and they've even allowed for that
with<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.670> section<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.299> there

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
with a little section in the back there

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
with a little section in the back there
so<00:01:45.659> he's<00:01:46.049> battle<00:01:46.320> pack<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.649> sit<00:01:47.119> unfortunate

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so he's battle pack and sit unfortunate

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.240 
so he's battle pack and sit unfortunate
is<00:01:48.180> no<00:01:48.329> firing<00:01:48.659> cannons<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> vehicle

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is no firing cannons on the vehicle

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.440 
is no firing cannons on the vehicle
there's<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> lot<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.640> cannons<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.270> or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
there's a lot of cannons on there or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
there's a lot of cannons on there or
gums<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.290> none<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.860> actually

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
gums on there but none of them actually

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
gums on there but none of them actually
fire<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.880> there's<00:01:54.030> no<00:01:54.060> projectile

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fire out so there's no projectile

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
fire out so there's no projectile
missiles<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.979> actually<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> bomb

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
missiles you do actually have the bomb

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.160 
missiles you do actually have the bomb
though<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.600> button<00:01:57.840> off<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.930> top

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
though and that's the button off the top

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
though and that's the button off the top
here<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.799> lift<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.219> underneath<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
here so if I lift it up underneath you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
here so if I lift it up underneath you
can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> bomb<00:02:01.020> compartment<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.520> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
can see the bomb compartment so when you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.260 
can see the bomb compartment so when you
push<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> button<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> top<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.549> bomb<00:02:05.880> will

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
push the button at the top the bomb will

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.559 
push the button at the top the bomb will
drop<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.660> there

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
drop out so there it is there

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.979 
drop out so there it is there
you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.989> see<00:02:11.579> and<00:02:12.579> lastly<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.359> I<00:02:13.480> said<00:02:13.689> the

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
you can see and lastly as I said the

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.899 
you can see and lastly as I said the
wings<00:02:14.379> can<00:02:14.739> go<00:02:14.829> up<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.069> down<00:02:15.219> so<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.489> can<00:02:15.700> fold

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
wings can go up and down so you can fold

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.170 
wings can go up and down so you can fold
the<00:02:16.180> wing<00:02:16.420> up<00:02:16.629> or<00:02:17.079> you<00:02:17.349> can<00:02:17.530> fold<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.939> down<00:02:18.939> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the wing up or you can fold it down the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.789 
the wing up or you can fold it down the
base<00:02:19.359> there<00:02:19.689> so<00:02:20.170> actually<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.499> can<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.709> it

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
base there so actually you can have it

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.280 
base there so actually you can have it
sitting<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.189> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> air<00:02:21.579> but<00:02:22.420> most<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.230> the
