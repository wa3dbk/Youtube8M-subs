00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.300 
acceleration for buyers
it's<00:02:53.760> hugely<00:02:54.920> superior<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.430> r18

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310

two sports bikes probably struggle to
keep<00:03:01.160> up<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.910> quite<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:03.290> approach

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
keep up but I quite like this approach

keep up but I quite like this approach
just<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.010> right<00:03:04.190> amount<00:03:04.430> power<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.940> would

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
just the right amount power that I would

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.839 
just the right amount power that I would
apply<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:06.800> around<00:03:07.010> 120<00:03:07.790> horsepower

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
apply and you know around 120 horsepower

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.130 
apply and you know around 120 horsepower
or<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:10.430> here<00:03:10.819> we<00:03:10.910> pull<00:03:11.120> ensues<00:03:11.540> at<00:03:11.900> all

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
yeah it's the bike itself it it's a nice

bike<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.370> hear<00:03:40.580> from<00:03:40.790> some<00:03:41.060> reviews<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.780> can

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
bike I hear from some reviews that can

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.780 
bike I hear from some reviews that can
be<00:03:42.050> quite<00:03:42.290> comfortable<00:03:42.560> after<00:03:43.190> an<00:03:43.280> hour<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.550> so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
be quite comfortable after an hour or so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.090 
be quite comfortable after an hour or so
or<00:03:44.060> for<00:03:44.390> long-distance<00:03:44.990> touring<00:03:45.470> riding<00:03:45.980> but

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
or for long-distance touring riding but

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.080 
or for long-distance touring riding but
I<00:03:46.130> think<00:03:46.460> it's<00:03:46.610> actually<00:03:46.790> quite<00:03:47.090> comfy<00:03:47.510> bike

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
I think it's actually quite comfy bike

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.280 
I think it's actually quite comfy bike
in<00:03:50.090> fact<00:03:50.480> there's<00:03:50.630> probably<00:03:50.870> comfier<00:03:51.230> than

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
in fact there's probably comfier than

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.630 
in fact there's probably comfier than
the<00:03:51.470> bike<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.890> own<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.350> noisy<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:55.220> not<00:03:55.400> too

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
the bike I own it is noisy but not too

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.050 
the bike I own it is noisy but not too
noisy<00:03:56.230> enough<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:58.340> know<00:03:58.459> let<00:03:58.760> people<00:03:59.030> know

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
noisy enough to you know let people know

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.520 
noisy enough to you know let people know
that<00:03:59.240> you're<00:03:59.510> coming<00:03:59.780> which<00:04:00.080> i<00:04:00.230> think<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.470> a

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
that you're coming which i think is a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.590 
that you're coming which i think is a
good<00:04:00.680> safety<00:04:01.450> sort<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.570> feature<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:05.239> boxer

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
good safety sort of feature the boxer

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.750 
good safety sort of feature the boxer
engine<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.230> older<00:04:06.680> engine<00:04:07.100> obviously<00:04:07.580> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
engine is the older engine obviously the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.140 
engine is the older engine obviously the
new<00:04:08.000> newer<00:04:08.510> boxer<00:04:08.959> in<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.320> GS<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.489> a<00:04:10.520> newer<00:04:10.880> I

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
new newer boxer in the GS is a newer I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.910 
new newer boxer in the GS is a newer I
don't<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:11.570> that<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.140> way<00:04:12.320> they've<00:04:12.590> got<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
don't like that the way they've got the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.800 
don't like that the way they've got the
air<00:04:13.130> intake<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.970> exhaust<00:04:14.030> going<00:04:14.540> down

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
air intake and the exhaust going down

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.509 
air intake and the exhaust going down
below<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.350> guess<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.709> ordered<00:04:16.040> over<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
below and I guess it's ordered over the

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.490 
below and I guess it's ordered over the
water<00:04:16.760> oil<00:04:16.940> cooling<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:18.079> where<00:04:18.230> this<00:04:18.350> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
water oil cooling it's where this is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.300 
water oil cooling it's where this is
just<00:04:18.650> oil<00:04:18.890> called

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310

we're updating anyway the acceleration
is<00:04:30.390> immense<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.910> liked<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:34.020> was<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.410> right

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
is immense I liked it it was just right

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.650 
is immense I liked it it was just right
and<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.490> was<00:04:35.670> never<00:04:35.850> right<00:04:36.060> as<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.420> see

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
and this was never right as you can see

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.749 
and this was never right as you can see
it<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.840> quite<00:04:37.050> nice<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.500> warning

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
it was quite nice and warning

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.189 
it was quite nice and warning
-<00:04:39.180> for<00:04:39.479> overnight<00:04:39.830> bit<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.949> black<00:04:41.129> ice<00:04:41.370> and

- for overnight bit of black ice and

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.059 
- for overnight bit of black ice and
didn't<00:04:43.199> really<00:04:43.379> want<00:04:43.559> to<00:04:43.620> push<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.889> too<00:04:43.919> much

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
didn't really want to push it too much

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.610 
didn't really want to push it too much
but<00:04:44.520> also<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.939> noticed<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.479> ABS<00:04:45.960> kick<00:04:46.259> in<00:04:46.409> every

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
but also I noticed the ABS kick in every

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.999 
but also I noticed the ABS kick in every
now<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.949> then<00:04:47.039> when<00:04:47.939> I<00:04:47.969> was<00:04:48.120> breaking<00:04:49.009> over

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
now and then when I was breaking over

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.790 
now and then when I was breaking over
areas<00:04:50.339> which<00:04:50.520> could<00:04:50.699> be<00:04:50.819> slightly<00:04:51.089> I<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.800> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
areas which could be slightly I see so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.549 
areas which could be slightly I see so
it's<00:04:53.009> just<00:04:53.219> another<00:04:53.370> sort<00:04:53.879> of<00:04:53.909> naught<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.569> 100

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:55.559 
it's just another sort of naught to 100

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.739 
it's just another sort of naught to 100
I'd<00:04:56.159> say<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.580> probably<00:04:56.849> did<00:04:56.939> in<00:04:57.059> about<00:04:57.150> four<00:04:57.629> or

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
I'd say it probably did in about four or

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.799 
I'd say it probably did in about four or
