00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.669
For centuries sailors have told of sea monsters
with massive tentacles but it was only last

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.559
year that scientists managed to photograph
a living Architeuthis.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.590
These remarkable images, captured by a Japanese
team, show an 8m giant squid about the size

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.740
of a bus freeing itself from a hook before
returning to the depths.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.740
But still no-one has captured a giant squid
alive. At Auckland's University of Technology,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.049
internationally renowned squid expert Dr Steve
O'Shea has studied giant squid washed up on

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:42.900
beaches, and caught in fishing trawls.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.929
Off the coast of New Zealand, Scientists embark
on an incredible journey.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.559
In a very high profile expedition funded by
the Discovery Channel, Dr O'Shea spent a month

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.829
at sea searching for these juveniles.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.789
Now, we found out where the juvenile giant
squid live, in the very surface layers. We

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.909
realised the giant squid were coming into
NZ waters to breed, we just put our nets in

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.869
the water at a time and a place where their
eggs would be hatching, and we got 17 of them.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.460
What we've got in here is two larvael Architeuthis,
one of them's going to swim right around,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.460
here he goes, right there. That's the healthiest
one that we've had so far.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.659
For Steve O'Shea, this moment is a long-time
coming.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.749
But his euphoria was short-lived. To get good
pictures of the juveniles, for the documentary,

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:43.140
a rectangular tank had been made. When the
juveniles were placed in the special tanks,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.030
disaster struck.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.920
What we found out since, you know, it was
pretty obvious, you put your juvenile giant

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.700
squid - which cost an astronomical amount
of money - into a rectangular tank, and it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.810
goes... straight to the bottom of the tank
and it's upside down and it's dead within

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.380
13 seconds.
If you take that animal out and you put it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.649
into a cylindrical tank, then about 30 seconds
later it's happily swimming around. So, we

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.159
killed them with our tanks. And then we put
them into polyethylene tanks, polyethylene

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.979
kills squid. In fact, we basically did everything
wrong.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.750
All of Steve's Architeuthis died.
