hello<00:00:00.599> there<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:01.050> Dave<00:00:01.170> Allen<00:00:01.439> for

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hello there this is Dave Allen for

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.320 
hello there this is Dave Allen for
Maxwell<00:00:01.920> equations<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.520> for<00:00:02.639> video<00:00:02.790> magical

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
Maxwell equations and for video magical

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.309 
Maxwell equations and for video magical
and<00:00:03.510> today<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> have<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> look<00:00:04.170> at

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
and today we're going to have a look at

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.590 
and today we're going to have a look at
motion<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.890> putting<00:00:05.549> some<00:00:05.910> objects<00:00:06.450> and

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
motion and putting some objects and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.750 
motion and putting some objects and
making<00:00:07.140> them<00:00:07.319> move<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.919> first<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.490> all<00:00:08.519> let's

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
making them move so first of all let's

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.339 
making them move so first of all let's
get<00:00:08.910> some<00:00:09.059> objects<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.630> put<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:09.960> there

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
get some objects to put in there

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
get some objects to put in there
we'll<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:11.040> into<00:00:11.250> library<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.150> we'll<00:00:12.330> go<00:00:12.509> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
we'll go into library and we'll go to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.369 
we'll go into library and we'll go to
content<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.639> content<00:00:15.030> will<00:00:15.269> go<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> fauna

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
content and in content will go to fauna

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.230 
content and in content will go to fauna
and<00:00:17.180> let's<00:00:18.180> choose<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> B<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.789> we'll<00:00:20.939> put<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> V

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and let's choose a B and we'll put the V

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.620 
and let's choose a B and we'll put the V
into<00:00:21.600> there<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.410> it'll<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.769> very

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
into there so we all it'll be very

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.820 
into there so we all it'll be very
stylish-looking<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.439> he's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> B

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
stylish-looking be there but he's a B

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
stylish-looking be there but he's a B
all<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> same<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> he<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
all the same and he will do and if I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
all the same and he will do and if I
press<00:00:28.260> play<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.359> see<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
press play now you see that it is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
press play now you see that it is
actually<00:00:30.960> move<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.769> he's<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.040> wings<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually move and he's got wings and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
actually move and he's got wings and
making<00:00:32.910> sort<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.690> he's<00:00:33.989> flying<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
making sort of look like he's flying so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.370 
making sort of look like he's flying so
that's<00:00:35.399> why<00:00:35.550> good<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.270> wanted<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> move<00:00:36.899> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that's why good but we wanted to move so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.080 
that's why good but we wanted to move so
let's<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
let's see what can do to make that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.639 
let's see what can do to make that
happen<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.110> let's<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.500> put

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
happen so first of all let's just put

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
happen so first of all let's just put
him<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> side<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.420> first

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
him over on this side here and the first

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.819 
him over on this side here and the first
thing<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> could<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> make<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.620> move

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
thing you could do to make your move

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.479 
thing you could do to make your move
would<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> add<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:45.410> behaviors<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.190> let's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
would be to add some behaviors so let's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
would be to add some behaviors so let's
go<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:48.000> library<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> behaviors

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
go to our library and go to behaviors

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
go to our library and go to behaviors
that<00:00:50.430> seems<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.090> basic<00:00:51.480> motion<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that seems to go for basic motion and we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.819 
that seems to go for basic motion and we
could<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> throw<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.270> we'll<00:00:55.230> add<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> throw

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
could use a throw so we'll add a throw

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
could use a throw so we'll add a throw
to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.250> big<00:00:56.430> press<00:00:57.090> play<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.020> what

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to the big press play and see what

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.720 
to the big press play and see what
happens

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
happens

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.010 
happens
not<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> moments<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:00.930> we

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
not a lot of the moments but then we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
not a lot of the moments but then we
have<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.500> sort<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> give<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have to actually sort of give the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
have to actually sort of give the
behavior<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:03.000> movement<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.290> let's<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
behavior some movement so let's have a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
behavior some movement so let's have a
look<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> hey<00:01:06.030> TD<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.720> hood<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
look at the hey TD the hood for this

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.580 
look at the hey TD the hood for this
here<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> let's<00:01:07.830> send<00:01:08.760> him<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.180> its<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
here and let's send him on its way so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
here and let's send him on its way so
that's<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.580> him<00:01:11.700> moving<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that's just going to have him moving in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.160 
that's just going to have him moving in
one<00:01:12.510> direction<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.200> he's<00:01:14.540> winging<00:01:15.540> his<00:01:15.750> way

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
one direction and he's winging his way

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.359 
one direction and he's winging his way
we<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.770> change<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.220> by<00:01:17.659> changing<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> zoom

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
we can change that by changing the zoom

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
we can change that by changing the zoom
going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.939> making<00:01:21.720> him<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> bit

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
going to this here making him go a bit

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to this here making him go a bit
faster<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> screen<00:01:24.540> flying

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
faster so there is on the screen flying

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.789 
faster so there is on the screen flying
away<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> distance<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.990> that's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
away and off into the distance so that's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.969 
away and off into the distance so that's
one<00:01:29.070> way<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> doing<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.110> let's<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.470> delete

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
one way of doing it so let's just delete

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
one way of doing it so let's just delete
the<00:01:32.280> throw<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.869> something<00:01:34.110> else

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the throw for now and use something else

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
the throw for now and use something else
we<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.340> add<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> motion<00:01:35.790> path<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> had

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
we could add a motion path so if we had

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.789 
we could add a motion path so if we had
a<00:01:37.110> motion<00:01:37.320> path<00:01:38.210> let's<00:01:39.530> drag<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> drop

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a motion path let's drag it and drop

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.999 
a motion path let's drag it and drop
them<00:01:41.130> onto<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> B<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> motion<00:01:43.860> path

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
them onto the B and the motion path

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
them onto the B and the motion path
basically<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> straight<00:01:45.840> line<00:01:45.869> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
basically put in a straight line so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.469 
basically put in a straight line so
let's<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.920> bring<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> start<00:01:47.790> motion<00:01:48.240> path

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
let's just bring the start motion path

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.649 
let's just bring the start motion path
over<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> he's<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.430> backwards<00:01:51.000> let's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
over here and he's going backwards let's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.340 
over here and he's going backwards let's
change<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.259> direction<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.070> reverse<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.350> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
change the direction to reverse and this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
change the direction to reverse and this
time<00:01:55.649> he's<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> fly<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
time he's going to fly in from the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.690 
time he's going to fly in from the
right-hand<00:01:57.689> side<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.259> come<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
right-hand side and come into the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
right-hand side and come into the
screens<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.210> another<00:02:00.450> way<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> doing<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
screens that's another way of doing it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.130 
screens that's another way of doing it
if<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.280> geometry<00:02:02.729> selected<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:04.079> we

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
if we have geometry selected what we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
if we have geometry selected what we
need<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.770> need<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.280> shape

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
need to do is we need to have a shape

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.169 
need to do is we need to have a shape
source<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.469> put<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> shape<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:08.879> so

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
source so let's put a shape in there so

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
source so let's put a shape in there so
let's<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.899> stop<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.289> from<00:02:10.410> flying<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
let's just stop you from flying for the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.250 
let's just stop you from flying for the
moments<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.550> he's<00:02:11.700> annoying<00:02:11.970> one

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
moments because he's annoying one

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.369 
moments because he's annoying one
doing<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.890> let's<00:02:13.549> make<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> shape<00:02:14.379> so

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
doing that and let's make a shape so

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.039 
doing that and let's make a shape so
let's<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.920> our<00:02:16.489> shape<00:02:17.329> maker<00:02:17.540> thing<00:02:17.840> here

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
let's go to our shape maker thing here

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.190 
let's go to our shape maker thing here
and<00:02:18.549> we're<00:02:19.549> not<00:02:19.760> gonna<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.180> fill<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:21.019> are

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and we're not gonna have a fill we are

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.289 
and we're not gonna have a fill we are
going<00:02:21.409> to<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.590> an<00:02:21.709> outline<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:23.150> will

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
going to have an outline and I will

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.339 
going to have an outline and I will
start<00:02:23.569> there

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
start there

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.809 
start there
yes<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.700> strange-looking<00:02:26.299> path<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.459> can

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
yes make a strange-looking path that can

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.839 
yes make a strange-looking path that can
be<00:02:29.000> our<00:02:29.239> shape<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.829> there<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.129> go<00:02:31.159> go<00:02:31.519> shape

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
be our shape so there we go go shape

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.830 
be our shape so there we go go shape
down<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.819> change<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.000> tool<00:02:35.269> back<00:02:35.599> to<00:02:35.750> this

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
down and change the tool back to this

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.199 
down and change the tool back to this
one<00:02:36.079> here<00:02:36.579> so<00:02:37.579> what<00:02:37.700> I'm<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:37.909> to<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
one here so what I'm going to do is I

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.670 
one here so what I'm going to do is I
want<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.390> take<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.599> base<00:02:38.810> shape<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.440> add<00:02:39.560> it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
want to take this base shape and add it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.740 
want to take this base shape and add it
to<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.890> motion<00:02:40.220> path<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.090> here's<00:02:41.269> our<00:02:41.359> motion

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
to the motion path so here's our motion

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.949 
to the motion path so here's our motion
path<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.609> let's<00:02:43.609> go<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.209> inspector<00:02:44.780> for

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
path and let's go to the inspector for

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.330 
path and let's go to the inspector for
the<00:02:45.019> motion<00:02:45.349> power<00:02:45.650> fat<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.040> I'm<00:02:46.159> going<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the motion power fat and I'm going to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.610 
the motion power fat and I'm going to
take<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> shape<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.150> put<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.989> into<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.409> shape

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
take a shape and put it into the shape

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.099 
take a shape and put it into the shape
source<00:02:48.980> okay<00:02:49.940> shot<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.269> busy<00:02:50.599> in<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.780> different

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
source okay shot the busy in a different

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.990 
source okay shot the busy in a different
group<00:02:51.319> now<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.920> let's<00:02:52.129> go<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.459> motion<00:02:52.849> path

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
group now so let's go to a motion path

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.670 
group now so let's go to a motion path
now<00:02:53.239> see<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.629> can<00:02:53.780> select<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.290> time<00:02:54.500> and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
now see if I can select it this time and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.720 
now see if I can select it this time and
put<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.889> into<00:02:56.440> shape<00:02:57.440> source<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.280> let's<00:02:58.489> grab

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
put it into shape source so let's grab

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.050 
put it into shape source so let's grab
it<00:02:58.909> drag<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> over<00:02:59.599> there<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.670> now<00:03:01.670> we've<00:03:01.849> got

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it drag it over there and now we've got

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.879 
it drag it over there and now we've got
a<00:03:02.090> shape<00:03:02.389> source<00:03:02.659> so<00:03:02.930> let's<00:03:03.139> press<00:03:03.379> play<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
a shape source so let's press play and

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.780 
a shape source so let's press play and
see<00:03:04.069> what<00:03:04.190> happens<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:07.129> there<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.340> go<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.670> can

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
see what happens so there you go we can

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.879 
see what happens so there you go we can
see<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.480> B<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.230> following<00:03:09.560> that

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
see that the B is now following that

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.039 
see that the B is now following that
shape<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.400> what<00:03:11.000> we<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.269> do<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.720> make<00:03:11.870> our

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
shape and what we can do is to make our

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.390 
shape and what we can do is to make our
video<00:03:12.319> look<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.709> bit<00:03:12.920> better<00:03:13.099> by

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
video look a little bit better by

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.210 
video look a little bit better by
turning<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.000> shape<00:03:14.480> off<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.019> you've<00:03:15.799> got<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
turning the shape off and you've got the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.610 
turning the shape off and you've got the
boot<00:03:16.549> just<00:03:16.940> flying<00:03:17.540> around<00:03:17.720> all<00:03:18.079> by<00:03:18.290> itself

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
boot just flying around all by itself

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.759 
boot just flying around all by itself
there<00:03:19.180> how<00:03:20.180> about<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.660> then<00:03:20.870> cool<00:03:21.379> or<00:03:21.590> what

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
there how about that then cool or what

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.009 
there how about that then cool or what
so<00:03:22.609> what<00:03:22.760> else<00:03:22.879> can<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.510> make<00:03:23.810> things

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
so what else can we do to make things

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.629 
so what else can we do to make things
move<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.500> there<00:03:24.709> let's<00:03:24.980> put<00:03:25.069> another<00:03:25.340> object

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
move in there let's put another object

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.430 
move in there let's put another object
in<00:03:25.940> there<00:03:26.120> first<00:03:26.359> of<00:03:26.480> all<00:03:26.599> so<00:03:26.870> let's<00:03:27.139> go<00:03:27.260> back

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
in there first of all so let's go back

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.460 
in there first of all so let's go back
to<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> library<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.049> we'll<00:03:30.049> go<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:32.470> content

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
to the library and we'll go to content

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.220 
to the library and we'll go to content
again<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.180> instead<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.329> flora<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.840> fauna

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
again and instead of flora and fauna

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.159 
again and instead of flora and fauna
let's<00:03:36.739> go<00:03:36.889> for<00:03:37.930> gadgets

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
let's go for gadgets

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.009 
let's go for gadgets
I<00:03:39.199> like<00:03:39.709> edits<00:03:40.510> what<00:03:41.510> are<00:03:41.569> we<00:03:41.629> going<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.900> get

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
I like edits what are we going to get

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.689 
I like edits what are we going to get
it's<00:03:42.260> we've<00:03:42.500> got<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> wall<00:03:42.859> clock<00:03:43.069> one<00:03:43.549> that

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
it's we've got a wall clock one that

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.809 
it's we've got a wall clock one that
goes<00:03:43.879> fast<00:03:44.829> okay<00:03:45.829> that<00:03:46.010> would<00:03:46.400> put<00:03:46.609> him<00:03:46.699> in

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
goes fast okay that would put him in

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.339 
goes fast okay that would put him in
there<00:03:47.030> let's<00:03:47.359> just<00:03:47.599> drag<00:03:47.810> them<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:47.989> drop<00:03:48.079> in

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
there let's just drag them and drop in

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.409 
there let's just drag them and drop in
there<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.919> we<00:03:49.069> got<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.220> fast-moving<00:03:49.699> wall<00:03:50.150> clock

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
there so we got a fast-moving wall clock

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.689 
there so we got a fast-moving wall clock
and<00:03:50.660> we'll<00:03:51.650> size<00:03:51.919> your<00:03:52.129> mother<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:52.400> first

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
and we'll size your mother but first

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.030 
and we'll size your mother but first
make<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.180> bit<00:03:53.329> smaller<00:03:53.750> got<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> shift<00:03:54.799> key

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
make it a bit smaller got the shift key

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.580 
make it a bit smaller got the shift key
held<00:03:55.250> down<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.970> I'm<00:03:56.690> keeping<00:03:57.019> them<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
held down and I'm keeping them to the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.129 
held down and I'm keeping them to the
same<00:03:57.859> proportion<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.699> there<00:03:58.909> we<00:03:59.000> go<00:03:59.120> so<00:04:00.049> we've

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
same proportion so there we go so we've

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.899 
same proportion so there we go so we've
got<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> clock<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.680> there<00:04:00.919> and<00:04:01.190> now<00:04:01.609> let's<00:04:01.819> go

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
got a clock on there and now let's go

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.680 
got a clock on there and now let's go
back<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.659> behaviors<00:04:03.169> and<00:04:04.060> add<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> behavior

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
back to the behaviors and add a behavior

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.140 
back to the behaviors and add a behavior
to<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.949> let's<00:04:06.949> how<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.159> move<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.849> clock

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
to that let's how to move to the clock

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.629 
to that let's how to move to the clock
and<00:04:08.479> has<00:04:09.109> clock<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.129> it's<00:04:10.280> going<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.459> move

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
and has clock and it's going to move

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.530 
and has clock and it's going to move
this<00:04:10.819> time<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.739> now<00:04:13.159> we<00:04:13.220> can<00:04:13.579> it's<00:04:14.239> got<00:04:14.359> some

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
this time so now we can it's got some

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.759 
this time so now we can it's got some
move<00:04:14.659> in<00:04:14.810> there<00:04:14.989> going<00:04:15.229> already

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
move in there going already

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.800 
move in there going already
and<00:04:16.120> we've<00:04:17.120> got<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.299> direction<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:18.139> or<00:04:18.440> from<00:04:19.810> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
and we've got a direction to or from and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.390 
and we've got a direction to or from and
we<00:04:20.989> have<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.169> constant<00:04:21.440> speed<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:21.979> we<00:04:22.190> can<00:04:22.310> go

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
we have a constant speed and we can go

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.709 
we have a constant speed and we can go
for<00:04:22.580> these<00:04:22.669> inner<00:04:22.940> reads<00:04:23.210> out<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.599> these

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
for these inner reads out and these

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.140 
for these inner reads out and these
things<00:04:23.870> there<00:04:24.080> again<00:04:24.349> as<00:04:24.500> we've<00:04:24.680> done<00:04:25.010> before

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
things there again as we've done before

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.270 
things there again as we've done before
they'll<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:26.660> make<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.410> thing<00:04:27.680> move<00:04:27.740> bit

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
they'll just make that thing move bit

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.400 
they'll just make that thing move bit
there<00:04:28.520> we<00:04:29.090> got<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> big<00:04:29.540> following<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.199> path

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
there we got a big following the path

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.379 
there we got a big following the path
I've<00:04:31.040> got<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.490> clock<00:04:31.880> which<00:04:32.090> you're<00:04:32.210> doing

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
I've got this clock which you're doing

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.510 
I've got this clock which you're doing
some<00:04:32.540> movement<00:04:32.900> as<00:04:33.020> well<00:04:33.259> so<00:04:34.070> let's<00:04:34.280> get<00:04:34.430> rid

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
some movement as well so let's get rid

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.070 
some movement as well so let's get rid
of<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:34.669> move<00:04:34.940> thing<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.570> moment<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
of this move thing for the moment and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.469 
of this move thing for the moment and
try<00:04:36.169> something<00:04:36.500> else<00:04:36.830> there<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.729> let's<00:04:38.090> take

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
try something else there so let's take

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.360 
try something else there so let's take
the<00:04:38.630> match<00:04:38.780> move<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.289> put<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.590> onto<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.160> clock

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
the match move and put it onto the clock

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.390 
the match move and put it onto the clock
and<00:04:40.639> we'll<00:04:41.630> go<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.970> inspector<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
and we'll go to the inspector and the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.670 
and we'll go to the inspector and the
moment<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:47.090> moving<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:48.050> matching<00:04:48.470> is

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
moment the moving that is matching is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.710 
moment the moving that is matching is
the<00:04:48.710> B<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:49.639> it's<00:04:49.820> going<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.030> match<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.389> move<00:04:50.570> of

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
the B so it's going to match the move of

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.689 
the B so it's going to match the move of
the<00:04:50.810> blue<00:04:50.990> so<00:04:51.229> that's<00:04:51.919> one<00:04:52.280> thing<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.610> you

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
the blue so that's one thing that you

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.010 
the blue so that's one thing that you
can<00:04:52.850> do<00:04:53.000> if<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.210> want<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.449> match<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.660> to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
can do if you want to match it to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.930 
can do if you want to match it to
something<00:04:54.500> else<00:04:54.800> that's<00:04:55.039> moving<00:04:55.580> in<00:04:55.789> your

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
something else that's moving in your

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.680 
something else that's moving in your
video<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.720> I've<00:04:56.930> shown<00:04:57.139> you<00:04:57.169> how<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:57.550> make

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
video and I've shown you how to make

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.200 
video and I've shown you how to make
objects<00:04:59.690> follow<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.650> path<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:01.789> this<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.060> dave

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
objects follow a path so this is dave

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.450 
objects follow a path so this is dave
