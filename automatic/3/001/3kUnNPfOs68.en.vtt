00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
right now seems legitimate I think

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.270 
right now seems legitimate I think
soundly<00:03:39.420> perfectly<00:03:39.930> logic<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.830> Tanner<00:03:41.070> has

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
soundly perfectly logic so Tanner has

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.390 
soundly perfectly logic so Tanner has
this<00:03:41.460> thing<00:03:42.020> he<00:03:43.020> calls<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.380> adventuring<00:03:44.040> which

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
this thing he calls it adventuring which

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
I'm not really sure what that means but

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.740
