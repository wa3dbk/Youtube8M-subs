00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 well here we are with our dear 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.269
 island sand gave the island 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.330
 good morning how are fine me 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.710
 I am very happy and conca pythons with captain 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.120
 you went up with the capi 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.040
 we must thank the people who 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.810
 they called the people who wrote 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.050
 those who do it is so cute too 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.110
 such a beautiful and beautiful technique 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.710
 really with nice colors very well 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.859
 very well done and in addition to the portfolio 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.100
 let's try to teach the bagging 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:42.870
 what do the ladies ask for but 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.030
 let's see if the weather is very good 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 for closing and doing on the part of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 abel nothing more 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.540
 graterÃ³n masters good morning ladies 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.309
 we start with the scheme as always 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.700
 we have the scheme is two centimeters 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.430
 by two centimeters each square and 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.330
 we have how we are going to draw 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.100
 one meter sixty one meter by sixty 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 centimeters is what this portfolio carries 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.070
 I can do more or less honditas depends 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.190
 what everyone wants as we begin 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 point 1 to point 2 of 2 I will go to 3 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.340
 from 3 to 4 from 4 to 5 and so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.789
 successively if I'm going to go up 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.220
 there I am creating the waves this we are going 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.310
 to set aside is what we do 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.250
 first the base as always the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.520
 2 x 2 grid once 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.430
 we have that what we are going to do is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 that tells us our scheme we carry 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.979
 the lines we will always leave 1 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320
 remember that we must always leave 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.690
 sewing up and the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 sides and down if we do 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.479
 whole not 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.869
 if we do not make it feel we should leave 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.840
 seam also down always my 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.340
 recommendation is not to cut the fabric 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.500
 first we make the outline and then 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.569
 We cut the fabrics because if I want it 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.220
 I can bigger it a little bit bigger 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.430
 how everyone wants 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.769
 the scheme tells me that I have to go from 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.690
 one end towards the other the square 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.989
 then I will go towards the vertices 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.290
 always following the scheme yes there 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.700
 We said from 1 to 2 from 2 to 3 and from 3 to 4 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.540
 as we started it we started here in the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.459
 point 1 I look at the scheme I do not need 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.230
 put it on the web and here I have to 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.560
 finish yes or yes remember very well that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.739
 I go to point 2 whenever I crossed the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.290
 line is because I have to go to the other 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.480
 vertex here subject 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.540
 I give a few stitches we will do more 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 fast you are going to carry with more 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.969
 slowness and I went to point 2 here I have 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.760
 to go up to point 3 but I'm going to go up to 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:09.519
 point 3 how would a basil I have 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.370
 to leave the thread the thread well 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.530
 extended and finished there again because 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.220
 if I'm not going to frown and it's not going to 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.709
 form what I want good the point 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.709
 buoy point 4 to the other vertex 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.970
 I make a stitch 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.190
 a stitch and what I'm going to do 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.739
 so for everyone to see me I 'm going to frown 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.409
 again if then I have the first 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.860
 point taken what would be a point of 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:44.550
 baste and come back here 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 I make some stitches and I'm going to finish 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.340
 you do more stitch there I'm going 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.580
 being suburb I always have to go up 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.450
 vertex that marks me 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.520
 where it starts and where it always ends 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.770
 the process is going to be the same cross 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.530
 how many times are necessary in the 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.190
 long in the width that I have here I'm going 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.190
 to finish 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.380
 when I reach the end when I arrive at 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.500
 final here I would have to climb again 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.370
 I will never start from above I have 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.580
 to start again down and so I go 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.500
 going up how will this be 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.039
 this is going to stay like this here 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
 in chiquitito and I 'm going to say that this 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.120
 I have to stretch it to form 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.980
 well the exact probe there we have it 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.640
 Now I'm going to show what I said 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.550
 in the meter with 60 centimeters in the 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.070
 wide if the mechanical earth is of a 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.320
 50 meter so we can give 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.660
 all the fabric that we want and then 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.400
 we just cut once we put together day 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.830
 back I have to stay all the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.950
 squares perfectly armed with 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.320
 this marker I wash once I mark 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.990
 and that I finish my work I washed it with 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.140
 water simply with water the marker 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 comes out and if not with chalk never with pencil if 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.260
 they use a pencil it has to be a pencil 6b 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.360
 which is also fine and can be washed and 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.400
 we will not be left with the brand I want less 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.270
 I make fewer squares I want more 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 long broad always trying to 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.140
 use the base here we have the base 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.689
 then we go up and down the 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.789
 squares 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.319
 here it would be finished and it would be the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.629
 I want it more chiquitito 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.100
 like this I make less amount of 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:39.410
 squares 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.970
 I'm going to a little minute with the bagging if 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.060
 we the explanation say that 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.710
 we place the handles is always leaving 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.010
 the same distance from one side to the 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.710
 another placed the two in the same way 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.690
 then placed the closure here I put a red one 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.830
 so that it can be seen in the same way 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.000
 I sew everything around that is the bagging 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.830
 I put it like this in this way 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.470
 the handles I put them in 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.560
 I put reverse with backhand or right with 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.040
 right is I have the seams of 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.250
 reverse and right with right I said that 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.450
 I can leave a bit open or I can 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.640
 Sewing directly here is easier 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.710
 directly machine sewing I leave some 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.790
 open stitches 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.790
 I turn quickly 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.990
 we turn it over and they are bagged 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.509
 perfect 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.910
 and it's much faster because good 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.670
 coat 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.760
 I have this and we have it ready and 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.670
 finished the round tendered in and 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.580
 I finish what was left open by sewing 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.500
 the hand has given a few stitches by hand and 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.990
 in this way it is perfect not us 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.600
 we have to forget that we have something that 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:00.010
 will circulate clear we end in round 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.170
 haci and there we were finished lind and 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.960
 neat after as we always finish 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:08.230
 with the corresponding color the rich 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.660
 the highly if I think it was fast 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.240
 but fantastic that it understands us 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.580
 thank you and thank you see you 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.920
 in the next the many thanks 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.110
 well now we're going to a cut and 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.320
 we continue with rosana ovejero that is going to 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:28.320
 explain the basis for calculation and the basis 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.320
 to sublimate rigid surfaces
