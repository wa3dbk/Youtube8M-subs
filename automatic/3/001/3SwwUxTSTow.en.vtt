00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
switch landing the second key is to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
switch landing the second key is to
practice<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> boardslide<00:00:34.829> movement<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
practice the boardslide movement as you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.900 
practice the boardslide movement as you
ride<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> safe<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.190> practice<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
ride this is a safe way to practice and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
ride this is a safe way to practice and
build<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.629> muscle<00:00:39.989> memory<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> third<00:00:43.649> skill

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
build your muscle memory the third skill

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
build your muscle memory the third skill
is<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> frontside<00:00:44.910> 180's<00:00:45.570> mastered<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is to have frontside 180's mastered this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
is to have frontside 180's mastered this
is<00:00:46.590> basically<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> same<00:00:47.520> trick<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
is basically the same trick as the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
is basically the same trick as the
backboard<00:00:48.629> slide<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.410> rotating<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
backboard slide but you're rotating in

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
backboard slide but you're rotating in
the<00:00:50.190> air<00:00:50.340> instead<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> box<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> let's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the air instead of on a box now let's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.810 
the air instead of on a box now let's
break<00:00:55.289> down<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.739> boardslide<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
break down the boardslide for the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
break down the boardslide for the
approach<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.199> turns<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.680> set<00:00:58.920> your

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
approach do one or two turns to set your

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
approach do one or two turns to set your
speed<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.550> arrive<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> box<00:01:00.510> doing<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
speed and arrive at the box doing a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
speed and arrive at the box doing a
mellow<00:01:01.109> heel<00:01:01.379> turn<00:01:01.649> slightly<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.730> heel

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
mellow heel turn slightly on your heel

edge<00:01:03.949> from<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.100> heels<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> small

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
edge from your heels you can do a small

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
edge from your heels you can do a small
hop<00:01:06.330> onto<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> box<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> continue<00:01:08.220> the
