00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
while later I had this feeling there was

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529 
while later I had this feeling there was
something<00:00:16.650> not<00:00:16.800> quite<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.420> something<00:00:18.420> has

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
something not quite right something has

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
changed it was not obvious at all and

changed it was not obvious at all and
this<00:00:21.240> had<00:00:21.359> been<00:00:21.510> looking<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> previous

this new packaging does it indicate a
reduction<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.079> 20%<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.860> maybe<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.760> small<00:00:54.059> area

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
