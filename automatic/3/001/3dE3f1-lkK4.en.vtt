now<00:03:03.370> you've<00:03:03.610> rear<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:04.030> z'd<00:03:04.090> them<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:05.410> rear

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
now you've rear a z'd them and they rear

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.280 
now you've rear a z'd them and they rear
A's<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.070> back<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:07.510> usually<00:03:07.690> one<00:03:07.930> hand

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
A's you back there's usually one hand

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.480 
A's you back there's usually one hand
they're<00:03:08.410> gonna<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:08.950> two<00:03:09.190> aces

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
they're gonna have and that's two aces

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.610 
they're gonna have and that's two aces
so<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.850> don't<00:03:10.210> profess<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.380> good<00:03:11.530> idea

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so I don't profess that it's a good idea

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.170 
so I don't profess that it's a good idea
to<00:03:11.770> fold<00:03:11.980> kings<00:03:12.190> very<00:03:12.400> often<00:03:12.700> before<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.970> flop

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
to fold kings very often before the flop

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.390 
to fold kings very often before the flop
but<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> situation<00:03:14.290> has<00:03:14.380> described<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.860> me<00:03:14.890> it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
but the situation has described to me it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.700 
but the situation has described to me it
would<00:03:15.550> seem<00:03:15.730> like<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:17.110> your<00:03:17.230> chip<00:03:17.380> stack<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
would seem like with your chip stack the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.530 
would seem like with your chip stack the
way<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> right<00:03:18.850> play<00:03:19.090> who's<00:03:19.390> to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
way it is be the right play who's to

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.070 
way it is be the right play who's to
fold<00:03:19.720> there

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
fold there

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.680 
fold there

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
how'd you made a smaller raised preflop

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.750
