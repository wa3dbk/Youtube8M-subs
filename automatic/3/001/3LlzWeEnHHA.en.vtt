00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.469
 hello to you gamers and welcome to 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.440
 world of gaming for the slumdog challenge 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.440
 billionaire trial fusion game 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.660
 so on this challenge you have to succeed in 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.630
 find the game tv and landed the big 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.290
 lot in fact this challenge is not good is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.030
 not very hard so the entrance where is 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.670
 the tv game is right behind the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.230
 trap the biotech panel therefore need 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.930
 fall back between the panel and the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 checkpoint then here you go forward 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.920
 gently to acquire on this ramp 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.590
 and you slip into the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.580
 pipe that takes you to where is going 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.580
 the tv game 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.010
 tv looks like who wants to win 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.530
 million 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 those who know think that all the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.470
 world knows moreover 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.259
 so in fact you have a series of 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.210
 questions and just answer by 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.710
 the right answer then do not do it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.229
 mistakes must be answered correctly 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.670
 all the questions 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.450
 so obviously the questions are about 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 the trial game inevitably in fact she 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.119
 regards all the tricks of the figures 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.140
 we do in the game, we have to answer 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.649
 by abc or d 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.630
 so I believe that in fact all the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.970
 questions are the same regardless of the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.619
 part you do but they do not 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.840
 are not asked in the same order you 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.700
 that you will do this challenge in my opinion 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.770
 they will not be for example the question 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.929
 that arises is said there with the answer 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.330
 what is said here will not be there it will be 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.280
 maybe not there the second question that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.229
 you will be asked but it is these are 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.569
 all the same questions and the same 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.450
 answers are not good 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.640
 complicated huh as you can see 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.149
 there is not twice a figure name 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 in fact it is each time the name of a 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.170
 figure like the bo and the other three 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.250
 proposals without completely wrong in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.910
 done when you have 10 seconds by 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.910
 question to answer 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.690
 for those who do not know too much 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.160
 the figures of the game I advise you to 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.450
 watch the video and quietly 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.820
 answer one by one 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.820
 to each question to validate this challenge 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.650
 with this challenge too you're validating a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.470
 blow you have validated the challenge you 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.690
 also unlock a success that is 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.660
 bound to this challenge then me the end of the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.040
 video we see that I validate the challenge but 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.360
 success does not show up i do not know 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.810
 not why I did not have the notification 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.220
 unlocking success that did not happen 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.600
 post I do not know why I had to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190
 touch something in the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.930
 settings 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.390
 but success did well 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.160
 for me so should unlock for 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.870
 you also once you have 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.690
 successful this challenge is so the last 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.070
 question going to toilet 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.990
 it's not necessarily the right answer 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 as if she's funny and that's so 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.380
 the challenge is unlocked and the success that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.240
 goes with 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.740
 so this is the challenge I hope the 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.340
 video will have helped you i hope she 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.200
 you will have liked 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.090

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200
