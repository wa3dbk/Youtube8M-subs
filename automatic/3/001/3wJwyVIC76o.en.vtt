00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
we're going to put a little sentiment in

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.310 
we're going to put a little sentiment in
this<00:02:22.190> batch<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.330> put<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> cinnamon<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.170> at

cinnamon sticks instead of the ground
cinnamon<00:02:32.890> that's<00:02:33.890> pretty<00:02:34.070> well<00:02:34.310> squished

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
cinnamon that's pretty well squished

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:45.970 
cinnamon that's pretty well squished
okay<00:02:36.110> Rebecca<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.780> good<00:02:44.780> handful<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.350> cinnamon

okay Rebecca so good handful of cinnamon
sticks<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.090> follow<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.660> yeah<00:02:54.110> we're

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
sticks and we follow that yeah we're

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.050 
sticks and we follow that yeah we're
going<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> fill<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.650> up<00:02:54.800> with<00:02:55.130> filtered

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
going to fill that up with filtered

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.320 
going to fill that up with filtered
water

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.670 

and<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:07.570> get<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.690> about<00:03:09.020> as<00:03:09.170> much<00:03:09.350> as<00:03:09.560> you

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
and then I get it about as much as you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.530 
and then I get it about as much as you
dare<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.220> put<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.670> pot<00:03:10.910> without<00:03:11.240> his

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
dare to put in the pot without his

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.260 
dare to put in the pot without his
bowling<00:03:11.960> over<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.550> can<00:03:16.580> play<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.240> it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
bowling over and you can play with it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.830 
bowling over and you can play with it
you<00:03:17.480> know<00:03:17.510> if<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:19.210> if<00:03:20.210> you<00:03:20.240> think<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:20.630> too

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
you know if it if you think it's too

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.010 
you know if it if you think it's too
strong<00:03:21.200> or<00:03:21.470> too<00:03:21.500> weak<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:22.220> know<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.430> can<00:03:22.610> use

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
strong or too weak you know you can use

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.980 
strong or too weak you know you can use
more<00:03:24.020> or<00:03:24.170> less<00:03:24.350> water<00:03:25.540> but<00:03:26.540> I'm<00:03:26.660> kind<00:03:26.930> of

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
more or less water but I'm kind of

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.320 
more or less water but I'm kind of
worked<00:03:27.170> out<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.770> formula<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.550> works<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.240> this

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
worked out a formula that works for this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.610 
worked out a formula that works for this
particular<00:03:29.870> pot<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.290> works<00:03:30.500> pretty<00:03:30.740> well<00:03:32.620> so

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
particular pot that works pretty well so

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.240 
particular pot that works pretty well so
i'm<00:03:33.740> going<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.950> put<00:03:34.040> in<00:03:35.770> later<00:03:36.770> on<00:03:37.010> we're<00:03:37.220> going

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
i'm going to put in later on we're going

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.910 
i'm going to put in later on we're going
to<00:03:37.370> add<00:03:37.520> some<00:03:37.550> cardamom<00:03:38.380> toward<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.530> end<00:03:39.710> of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
to add some cardamom toward the end of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.300 
to add some cardamom toward the end of
it<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.640> boiling<00:03:41.060> here<00:03:41.830> let<00:03:42.830> that<00:03:43.040> cook<00:03:43.250> for

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
it of the boiling here let that cook for

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.890 
it of the boiling here let that cook for
a<00:03:43.550> few<00:03:43.730> minutes<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.180> that's<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.480> very<00:03:44.690> end

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
a few minutes and that's a very end

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.390 
a few minutes and that's a very end
we'll<00:03:45.050> put<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.260> a<00:03:45.290> black<00:03:45.530> tea<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:45.920> then<00:03:46.040> strain

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
we'll put in a black tea and then strain

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.720 
we'll put in a black tea and then strain
it<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.690> grinding<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.380> caramel<00:03:51.950> grinding

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
I make it right right to the tip top so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.760 
I make it right right to the tip top so
it's<00:04:00.740> actually<00:04:01.070> probably<00:04:01.490> almost<00:04:02.090> three<00:04:02.480> cups

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
oh you can take it off the heat if you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.890 
oh you can take it off the heat if you
like<00:05:02.210> dumped<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.290> that<00:05:03.500> tea<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.510> let<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.540> sit

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
like dumped in that tea and let it sit

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.430 
like dumped in that tea and let it sit
for<00:05:05.930> three<00:05:06.470> minutes<00:05:06.680> no<00:05:07.040> longer<00:05:08.260> after<00:05:09.260> three

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
for three minutes no longer after three

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.020 
for three minutes no longer after three
minutes<00:05:09.560> you've<00:05:09.860> gotten<00:05:10.160> all<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.400> flavor<00:05:10.700> all

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030

the<00:05:11.180> caffeine<00:05:11.630> out<00:05:11.840> if<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.200> stays<00:05:12.440> longer<00:05:12.740> you

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
the caffeine out if it stays longer you

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.250 
the caffeine out if it stays longer you
just<00:05:13.160> get<00:05:13.310> tannen<00:05:13.700> which<00:05:14.540> is<00:05:14.720> hard<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.080> your

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
just get tannen which is hard on your
