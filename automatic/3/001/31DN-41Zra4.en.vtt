after the board draw at villa park and
these<00:01:12.680> teams<00:01:12.950> last<00:01:13.100> met<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.700> think<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:14.630> yeah<00:01:14.810> I

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
these teams last met I think so yeah I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.810 
these teams last met I think so yeah I
mean<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.170> was<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.290> real<00:01:15.560> kind<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:16.070> defensive

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
mean that was a real kind of defensive

war<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.150> attrition<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.750> game<00:01:17.930> at<00:01:18.080> villa<00:01:18.259> park

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
war of attrition the game at villa park

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.859 
war of attrition the game at villa park
and<00:01:18.860> i<00:01:19.310> think<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.030> difference<00:01:20.240> with<00:01:20.750> this

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
and i think the difference with this

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.560 
and i think the difference with this
game<00:01:21.110> isn't<00:01:21.259> andrews<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.570> somebody's

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
game isn't andrews is that somebody's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.950 
game isn't andrews is that somebody's
gotta<00:01:23.750> win<00:01:23.900> eat<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.590> night<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.899> don't<00:01:26.899> think

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
gotta win eat on the night I don't think

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.950 
gotta win eat on the night I don't think
auditing<00:01:27.710> can<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:28.070> sitting<00:01:28.759> back<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.659> blind

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
auditing can be sitting back and blind

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.300 
auditing can be sitting back and blind
for<00:01:30.109> penalties<00:01:30.499> because<00:01:30.619> they<00:01:30.799> needed<00:01:31.039> come<00:01:31.249> a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
for penalties because they needed come a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.690 
for penalties because they needed come a
lottery<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:31.850> i<00:01:31.939> think<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.950> given<00:01:33.950> given<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
lottery so i think and given given the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.760
