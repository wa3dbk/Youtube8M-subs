00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.450 
alright so the rift which you just heard
is<00:01:05.750> based<00:01:06.080> on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> scale<00:01:06.620> called<00:01:06.950> composite

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
is based on the scale called composite

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.870 
is based on the scale called composite
toe<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:09.350> Hindustani<00:01:10.160> classical<00:01:10.220> music

it's also called as rock pools inner Sri
now<00:01:13.340> from<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.790> major<00:01:14.090> scale<00:01:14.540> perspective<00:01:15.320> I

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
now from a major scale perspective I

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.190 
now from a major scale perspective I
just<00:01:15.770> show<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.310> how<00:01:16.610> exactly<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.810> riff<00:01:17.960> is

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
just show you how exactly the riff is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.070 
just show you how exactly the riff is
different<00:01:18.700> alright<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.000> I'm<00:01:20.240> playing<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.870> key

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
different alright so I'm playing the key

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.790 
different alright so I'm playing the key
of<00:01:21.230> E<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:22.480> if<00:01:23.480> we<00:01:23.540> check<00:01:23.990> out<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.200> scale<00:01:24.650> a

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
of E so if we check out the scale a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.190 
of E so if we check out the scale a
major<00:01:25.010> scale<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> key<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.820> E<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.960> nodes

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
major scale in the key of E the nodes

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.660 
major scale in the key of E the nodes
will<00:01:27.470> be<00:01:27.590> e<00:01:27.890> f-sharp<00:01:28.870> g-sharp<00:01:30.220> then<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:31.370> have<00:01:31.520> a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
will be e f-sharp g-sharp then we have a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.270 
will be e f-sharp g-sharp then we have a
B<00:01:32.570> C<00:01:33.290> sharp<00:01:33.580> d<00:01:34.580> sharp<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.030> E<00:01:35.710> alright<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.250> that

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
B C sharp d sharp and E alright so that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.920 
B C sharp d sharp and E alright so that
is<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.550> major<00:01:37.700> scale<00:01:38.090> now<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> difference

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
is a major scale now the difference

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.490 
is a major scale now the difference
between<00:01:39.410> these<00:01:39.590> two<00:01:39.650> scale<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:41.500> the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
between these two scale is like the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.400 
between these two scale is like the
composite<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.100> has<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.580> flat<00:01:43.970> second<00:01:44.479> so

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
composite to has a flat second so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.870 
composite to has a flat second so
instead<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.770> playing<00:01:46.010> f-sharp<00:01:46.250> you're

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
instead of playing f-sharp you're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.859 
instead of playing f-sharp you're
playing<00:01:47.030> F<00:01:48.009> then<00:01:49.009> third<00:01:49.850> nodes<00:01:50.119> stays<00:01:50.720> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
playing F then third nodes stays the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.380 
playing F then third nodes stays the
same<00:01:51.050> fourth<00:01:51.979> note<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.400> flat<00:01:52.729> half<00:01:53.150> step

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
same fourth note is flat half step

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.540 
same fourth note is flat half step
higher<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.560> goes<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.340> shop<00:01:55.940> instead<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.600> a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
higher so it goes to a shop instead of a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.160 
higher so it goes to a shop instead of a
the<00:01:58.550> fifth<00:01:58.790> road<00:01:59.030> float<00:01:59.509> remains<00:01:59.840> constant

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
the fifth road float remains constant

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.820 
the fifth road float remains constant
and<00:02:00.530> then<00:02:01.280> on<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.700> sixth<00:02:02.180> one<00:02:02.470> it's<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.619> flat

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and then on the sixth one it's a flat

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.550 
and then on the sixth one it's a flat
half-step<00:02:04.430> flat<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.450> what<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.230> end<00:02:06.409> up

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
half-step flat so what in the end up

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.419 
half-step flat so what in the end up
trying<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.860> play<00:02:07.010> here<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.760> e<00:02:08.050> f<00:02:09.050> g<00:02:09.619> sharp

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
trying to play here is like e f g sharp

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.070 
trying to play here is like e f g sharp
a<00:02:10.760> sharp<00:02:11.269> B<00:02:12.260> C

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
a sharp B C

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.540

and<00:02:14.430> d<00:02:15.430> sharp<00:02:15.670> E<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.770> song<00:02:18.070> I've<00:02:18.280> used

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and d sharp E so in this song I've used

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.680 
and d sharp E so in this song I've used
the<00:02:18.730> scale<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.260> I'll<00:02:20.260> say<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.640> odd<00:02:22.180> note<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the scale and I'll say the odd note the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.720 
the scale and I'll say the odd note the
entire<00:02:22.960> song<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.290> playing<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.740> scale<00:02:24.010> it's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
entire song is playing on the scale it's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.400 
entire song is playing on the scale it's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
broken down in different places in

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.760 
broken down in different places in
different<00:02:26.650> parts<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:28.080> that's<00:02:29.080> how<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.620> song
