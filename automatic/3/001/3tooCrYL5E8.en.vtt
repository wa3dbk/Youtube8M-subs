to put it

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.720 
to put it
just<00:00:46.840> understand<00:00:47.379> certain<00:00:47.859> tricks<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.340> we

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
just understand certain tricks that we

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.060 
just understand certain tricks that we
as<00:00:49.000> players<00:00:49.390> used<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.989> have<00:00:50.739> an<00:00:50.859> advantage

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
as players used to have an advantage

over<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.399> enemy<00:00:51.969> I<00:00:52.899> guess<00:00:53.109> you<00:00:53.230> guess<00:00:53.829> you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
over the enemy I guess you guess you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.410 
over the enemy I guess you guess you
could<00:00:54.039> put<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.399> way

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
could put it that way

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.610 
could put it that way
as<00:00:55.719> you<00:00:55.809> can<00:00:55.899> tell<00:00:56.050> us<00:00:56.140> also<00:00:56.230> my<00:00:56.379> first

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's pretty repetitive and easy now it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's pretty repetitive and easy now it
doesn't<00:01:42.670> look<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:42.880> much<00:01:43.150> obviously<00:01:43.660> I'm

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
doesn't look like much obviously I'm

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.120 
doesn't look like much obviously I'm
just<00:01:43.840> sprint<00:01:44.170> jump<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.500> like<00:01:44.620> this<00:01:44.920> guy's

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
just sprint jump and like this guy's

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.620 
just sprint jump and like this guy's
bunny<00:01:45.370> hopping<00:01:45.610> across<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.090> street<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.540> this

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
bunny hopping across the street and this

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.140 
bunny hopping across the street and this
guy's<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.930> best<00:01:47.140> but<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:48.460> reality<00:01:48.730> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
guy's the best but in reality it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.970 
guy's the best but in reality it
actually<00:01:49.180> works<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.990> lot<00:01:50.110> better<00:01:50.170> than<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.560> so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
actually works a lot better than that so

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually works a lot better than that so
I'm<00:01:51.460> gonna<00:01:51.550> go<00:01:51.700> back<00:01:51.850> here<00:01:52.030> with<00:01:52.150> Michael

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390

but it's just right now it's gonna be

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.300 
but it's just right now it's gonna be
little<00:02:02.320> easy<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.620> do<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.830> will<00:02:03.190> probably

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
little easy to do this will probably

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.610 
little easy to do this will probably
figure<00:02:03.550> out<00:02:03.670> some<00:02:03.970> sort<00:02:04.150> of<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.330> way<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.230> improve

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.669 
figure out some sort of a way to improve
as<00:02:05.800> time<00:02:05.950> goes<00:02:06.160> on<00:02:06.310> as<00:02:06.840> Nate<00:02:07.840> explodes<00:02:08.319> here

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
as time goes on as Nate explodes here

just as you can see it's definitely a
huge<00:03:58.410> advantage<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:58.949> pretty<00:03:59.160> much

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
huge advantage and pretty much

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.159 
huge advantage and pretty much
especially<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.329> infantry<00:04:00.659> it's<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.900> huge

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
especially with infantry it's a huge

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.409 
especially with infantry it's a huge
advantage<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.919> you're<00:04:02.220> gonna<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.519> let<00:04:03.329> me

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
advantage like you're gonna have let me

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.939 
advantage like you're gonna have let me
look<00:04:03.540> how<00:04:03.629> much<00:04:03.810> ahead<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.349> he<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.470> amin<00:04:04.829> ow

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
look how much ahead of he is amin ow

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.339 
look how much ahead of he is amin ow
like<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.940> comparison<00:04:06.209> from<00:04:06.690> sita<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:07.739> just

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
like in comparison from sita a it's just

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.300 
like in comparison from sita a it's just
he<00:04:10.349> gets<00:04:10.470> there<00:04:10.709> probably<00:04:10.949> about<00:04:11.010> five

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
he gets there probably about five

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.960 
he gets there probably about five
seconds<00:04:11.639> quicker<00:04:11.819> than<00:04:12.000> me<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.329> not<00:04:12.629> more

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
sprint jump continue to jump in see you

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.690 
sprint jump continue to jump in see you
look<00:04:57.620> at<00:04:57.710> all<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.070> climbing<00:04:58.310> stairs<00:04:58.520> that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
look at all the climbing stairs that

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.450 
look at all the climbing stairs that
make<00:04:58.820> sense<00:04:59.200> you<00:05:00.200> know<00:05:00.290> it<00:05:00.410> doesn't<00:05:00.740> none<00:05:01.370> of

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
make sense you know it doesn't none of

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.790 
make sense you know it doesn't none of
that<00:05:01.490> actually<00:05:01.760> helps<00:05:02.120> there<00:05:02.270> anything<00:05:02.800> going

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
that actually helps there anything going

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.080 
that actually helps there anything going
down<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.130> stairs<00:05:04.310> see<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:04.760> think<00:05:04.850> you<00:05:05.030> can

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
down the stairs see I think you can

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.250 
down the stairs see I think you can
sprint<00:05:05.330> jump<00:05:05.510> down<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.840> think<00:05:05.990> it's<00:05:06.080> an<00:05:06.140> issue

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
sprint jump down I think it's an issue

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.660 
sprint jump down I think it's an issue
with<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.770> can<00:05:07.220> just<00:05:07.400> jump<00:05:07.580> over

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
with that but you can just jump over

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.810 
with that but you can just jump over
them<00:05:07.880> anyway<00:05:08.200> but<00:05:09.430> outside<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.580> it's

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
them anyway but outside of that it's

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
them anyway but outside of that it's
really<00:05:10.970> all<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.210> need<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.360> know<00:05:11.450> about<00:05:11.540> sprint
