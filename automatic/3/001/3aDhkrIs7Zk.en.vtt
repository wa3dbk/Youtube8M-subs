00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
just like peach there's not really

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.720 
just like peach there's not really
anything<00:03:36.600> else<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.410> candle<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.010> you

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
anything else in the candle that you

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.220 
anything else in the candle that you
know<00:03:38.819> makes<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.209> smell<00:03:39.420> anything<00:03:39.750> different

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
know makes it smell anything different

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.210 
know makes it smell anything different
than<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.489> true<00:03:41.489> true<00:03:42.209> peach<00:03:42.959> smell<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.829> really

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
than a true true peach smell so I really

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.789 
than a true true peach smell so I really
like<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:45.480> then<00:03:45.989> right<00:03:46.230> here<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.530> can

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
like that and then right here you can

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.800 
like that and then right here you can
see<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.069> ended<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.579> getting<00:03:47.730> summer<00:03:48.180> boardwalk

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
see I ended up getting summer boardwalk

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.110 
see I ended up getting summer boardwalk
and<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.530> candle<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.130> talked<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.940> much

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and that candle is talked about so much

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.770 
and that candle is talked about so much
on<00:03:51.500> YouTube<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:53.000> there's<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.269> many<00:03:54.389> like

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
on YouTube here there's so many like

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
on YouTube here there's so many like
positive<00:03:55.380> things<00:03:55.620> saying<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.430> being<00:03:56.670> spoken

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
positive things saying like being spoken

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.300 
positive things saying like being spoken
about<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.599> so<00:03:57.660> i<00:03:58.380> figured<00:03:58.739> i<00:03:58.829> would<00:03:58.950> give<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
about it so i figured i would give it a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.089 
about it so i figured i would give it a
try<00:03:59.639> and<00:04:00.000> i<00:04:00.450> already<00:04:00.630> smelled<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.859> me

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
try and i already smelled it and to me

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.879 
try and i already smelled it and to me
on<00:04:02.430> first<00:04:03.209> sniff<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.870> smells<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.829> a

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
on first sniff it smells like a

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.729 
on first sniff it smells like a
combination<00:04:05.819> of<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.359> candied<00:04:07.049> apple<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
combination of a candied apple and a

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.190 
combination of a candied apple and a
caramel<00:04:08.099> apple<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.269> candied<00:04:09.660> apples<00:04:10.049> are

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
caramel apple so the candied apples are

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.349 
caramel apple so the candied apples are
the<00:04:10.319> sugar<00:04:10.590> coated<00:04:11.069> ones<00:04:11.220> obviously<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
the sugar coated ones obviously and the

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.240 
the sugar coated ones obviously and the
caramel<00:04:12.750> apples<00:04:13.079> are<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.349> caramel<00:04:13.769> ones<00:04:13.799> and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
caramel apples are the caramel ones and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.199 
caramel apples are the caramel ones and
i'm<00:04:14.910> not<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.180> big<00:04:15.419> caramel<00:04:15.900> fan<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.160> figured<00:04:18.120> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
i'm not a big caramel fan so I figured I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.879 
i'm not a big caramel fan so I figured I
would<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:18.389> give<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> try<00:04:19.019> anyway<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.799> I'll

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
would just give it a try anyway and I'll

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.430 
would just give it a try anyway and I'll
definitely<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.760> making<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.209> review<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.840> what<00:04:22.409> I

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
definitely be making a review on what I

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.810 
definitely be making a review on what I
think<00:04:22.740> about<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.159> summer<00:04:23.370> boardwalk<00:04:23.880> candle

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
think about the summer boardwalk candle

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.430 
think about the summer boardwalk candle
then<00:04:25.910> I<00:04:25.940> ended<00:04:26.180> up<00:04:26.240> getting<00:04:26.420> two<00:04:26.780> soaps<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.320> I

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
then I ended up getting two soaps like I

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
then I ended up getting two soaps like I
said<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.070> one<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.780> wild<00:04:29.780> berry<00:04:30.460> dalia

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
said and this one is wild berry dalia

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.600 
said and this one is wild berry dalia
and<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.570> other<00:04:32.870> one<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.410> raspberry<00:04:34.310> pink

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
and the other one is raspberry pink

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.810 
and the other one is raspberry pink
peony<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:36.350> really<00:04:36.920> like<00:04:37.070> these<00:04:37.280> sense<00:04:37.580> a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
peony and I really like these sense a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.940 
peony and I really like these sense a
lot<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.360> something<00:04:38.810> new<00:04:39.110> different<00:04:39.560> than

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
lot it's something new different than

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.070 
lot it's something new different than
just<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.460> pure<00:04:40.730> fruit<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.450> figured<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.930> would

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
just the pure fruit so I figured I would

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.230 
just the pure fruit so I figured I would
give<00:04:42.350> them<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.620> try<00:04:42.830> because<00:04:43.640> I'm<00:04:43.910> kind<00:04:44.090> of

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
give them a try because I'm kind of

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.690 
give them a try because I'm kind of
getting<00:04:44.390> tired<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:45.110> just<00:04:45.680> playing<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.280> fresh

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
getting tired of just playing the fresh

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.480 
getting tired of just playing the fresh
pic<00:04:46.970> line<00:04:47.210> playing<00:04:47.720> fruit<00:04:48.020> sense<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.770> that's

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
pic line playing fruit sense so that's

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.460 
pic line playing fruit sense so that's
something<00:04:49.730> new<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.240> have<00:04:50.660> out<00:04:50.990> and
