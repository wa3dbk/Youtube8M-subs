 this time it's Australia that I invite you to discover a 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.760
 bodyboarder a little cracked 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.909

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.220
 this is the only case of greece it's called enormous needs and the only one 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.749
 something that is sure

 is of course not within the reach of all 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.129
 this is what we call a superb pass here

 bodyboarding is a discipline 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.559
 publicized but well worth knowing 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.649
 it is also often through this sport that we start the practice of surfing 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.869

 a victory that bodes well for the future 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.060
 and yet it was not so easy in addition final customer finds 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.470
