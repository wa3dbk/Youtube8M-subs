00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
rather than being like this they're just

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.910 
rather than being like this they're just
staying<00:02:36.090> real<00:02:36.300> tight<00:02:36.570> that's<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.200> fat<00:02:37.560> hand

options<00:04:03.150> in<00:04:03.269> my<00:04:03.420> opinion<00:04:05.090> squatting<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.930> be

options in my opinion squatting can be

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.910 
options in my opinion squatting can be
done<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.799> has<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.160> done<00:04:08.340> light<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.530> it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
done but it has to be done light and it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.500 
done but it has to be done light and it
has<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.100> be<00:04:11.340> done<00:04:11.459> for<00:04:11.519> low<00:04:11.820> repetitions

people<00:04:13.230> make<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.560> big<00:04:13.709> mistake<00:04:14.190> they<00:04:14.459> make<00:04:14.610> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
people make the big mistake they make a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.479 
people make the big mistake they make a
huge<00:04:15.209> mistake<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:16.019> thinking<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.919> when<00:04:17.310> you

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
huge mistake of thinking that when you

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.789 
huge mistake of thinking that when you
go<00:04:17.760> when<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.239> get<00:04:18.390> hurt<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.530> you're<00:04:19.680> going

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
go when you get hurt that you're going

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.560 
go when you get hurt that you're going
to<00:04:19.859> want<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.220> do<00:04:20.310> higher<00:04:20.669> reps<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.390> that's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
to want to do higher reps and that's

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.420 
to want to do higher reps and that's
because<00:04:21.810> they<00:04:22.590> want<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> try<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.070> keep<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
because they want to try to keep the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.880 
because they want to try to keep the
percentage<00:04:24.000> much<00:04:24.270> lower<00:04:24.599> but<00:04:25.410> really<00:04:25.770> what

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
percentage much lower but really what

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.810 
percentage much lower but really what
you're<00:04:25.979> trying<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.490> do<00:04:26.640> is

you're trying to do is

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.650 
you're trying to do is
you<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.180> try<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:28.610> do<00:04:29.610> do<00:04:30.030> lower

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
you want to try to do do lower

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.540 
you want to try to do do lower
repetitions<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.920> you're<00:04:32.040> not<00:04:32.130> under<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
repetitions so you're not under the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.670 
repetitions so you're not under the
barbell<00:04:33.030> for<00:04:33.600> too<00:04:33.780> long<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:34.230> you're<00:04:34.290> not<00:04:34.410> under

deadlift around 400 I'd suggest maybe

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.410 
deadlift around 400 I'd suggest maybe
use<00:05:28.830> two<00:05:29.040> plates<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:29.490> again<00:05:29.730> we're<00:05:29.910> not<00:05:30.090> fifty

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
use two plates so again we're not fifty

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.840 
use two plates so again we're not fifty
