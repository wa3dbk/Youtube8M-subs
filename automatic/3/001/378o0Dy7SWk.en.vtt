00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
they've got a couple of boys missing

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.559 
they've got a couple of boys missing
with<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.129> O'Leary's<00:02:29.549> but<00:02:29.849> we<00:02:30.360> can't

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
with the O'Leary's but we can't

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.640 
with the O'Leary's but we can't
underestimate<00:02:30.840> them<00:02:31.230> they're<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> good<00:02:31.620> team

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
underestimate them they're a good team

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.559 
underestimate them they're a good team
they've<00:02:31.980> got<00:02:32.099> talented<00:02:32.549> players<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.480> think

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
they've got talented players so I think

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.600 
they've got talented players so I think
the<00:02:33.870> focus<00:02:34.079> is<00:02:34.379> just<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.829> worry<00:02:35.159> about<00:02:35.250> our<00:02:35.489> own

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the focus is just to worry about our own

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.759 
the focus is just to worry about our own
game<00:02:35.790> play<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.690> ball<00:02:36.840> sure<00:02:37.079> like<00:02:37.349> we<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.620> we

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
game play the ball sure like we know we

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.680 
game play the ball sure like we know we
had<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.129> keep<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.519> ball<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.940> hopefully<00:02:39.599> we

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
had to keep the ball and hopefully we

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.409 
had to keep the ball and hopefully we
bank<00:02:39.900> some<00:02:40.049> golden
