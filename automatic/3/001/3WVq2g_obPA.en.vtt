application so go to spotlight and just
surface<00:01:01.020> yourself<00:01:01.379> terminal<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.699> should

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
surface yourself terminal and it should

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969 
surface yourself terminal and it should
be<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.690> open<00:01:04.020> up<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> application<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
by the way terminal is built into your

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.770 
by the way terminal is built into your
Mac<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:08.009> download<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.550> required<00:01:08.940> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
Mac so you know download is required so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
Mac so you know download is required so
once<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.500> terminal<00:01:10.950> window<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.580> you

once you got this terminal window as you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310 
once you got this terminal window as you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you're not experienced with terminal of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.669 
you're not experienced with terminal of
haven't<00:01:15.030> used<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:16.050> what<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.289> is<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
haven't used it basically what it is you

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.010 
haven't used it basically what it is you
can<00:01:16.830> execute<00:01:17.190> commands<00:01:17.820> almost<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.630> command

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can execute commands almost like command

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
can execute commands almost like command
prompt<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.470> Windows<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.610> previous

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
prompt on Windows if you're a previous

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.810 
prompt on Windows if you're a previous
Windows<00:01:21.479> Sekhmet<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.460> prompt

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
Windows Sekhmet from you can prompt

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
Windows Sekhmet from you can prompt
command<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.049> find<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.409> useful<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
command and I find it very useful to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.450 
command and I find it very useful to
free<00:01:26.280> me<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.880> making<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> Mac<00:01:27.450> faster<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
free me from making a Mac faster and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
free me from making a Mac faster and
yeah<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:31.079> some

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
yeah so here as you can see are some

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
yeah so here as you can see are some
command<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.159> actually<00:01:32.280> put<00:01:32.909> into

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
command that you can actually put into

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
command that you can actually put into
terminal<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> mac

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
terminal that will actually make the mac

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.880 
terminal that will actually make the mac
faster<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.939> some<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.320> your

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
faster so some people don't use your

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.140 
faster so some people don't use your
desperate<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> those<00:01:38.820> people

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
kill your dashboard and not use it at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.929 
kill your dashboard and not use it at
all<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:47.009> actually<00:01:47.159> saves<00:01:47.399> off<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> lot<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
all and it actually saves off a lot of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.020 
all and it actually saves off a lot of
CPU<00:01:48.540> usage<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.530> RAM<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.579> even<00:01:50.939> if

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
CPU usage and RAM because if even if

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
CPU usage and RAM because if even if
you're<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.240> using<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.869> runs<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you're not using it it runs at the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.460 
you're not using it it runs at the
background<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:53.670> kill<00:01:54.030> your

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
background so you can actually kill your

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
background so you can actually kill your
dashboard<00:01:55.470> using<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.070> code<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.420> copy

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
dashboard using this code so just copy

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
dashboard using this code so just copy
that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> paste<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.649> into<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.070> press

here it always said it and the we can
actually<00:02:19.090> access<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.660> duck<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
actually access the duck or the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.640 
actually access the duck or the
dashboard<00:02:21.430> sorry<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.120> yeah<00:02:22.480> that's<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.110> big<00:02:23.470> way

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
dashboard sorry so yeah that's a big way

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.310 
dashboard sorry so yeah that's a big way
of<00:02:23.830> actually<00:02:23.950> making<00:02:24.220> your<00:02:24.670> Mac<00:02:24.850> faster<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
of actually making your Mac faster the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.350 
of actually making your Mac faster the
next<00:02:26.560> step<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.950> actually<00:02:27.130> use<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.550> 2d<00:02:27.910> dog<00:02:28.120> as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
next step is to actually use a 2d dog as

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.820 
next step is to actually use a 2d dog as
you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.630> see<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.080> bottom<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:29.800> a

you can see here on the bottom I have a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
you can see here on the bottom I have a
2d<00:02:30.160> pocket<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.670> personally<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.210> with<00:02:31.390> you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
teed off more but you might miss the B

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.990 
teed off more but you might miss the B
dog<00:02:34.630> that's<00:02:34.900> built<00:02:35.140> into<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.620> latest<00:02:36.010> OS<00:02:36.640> 10

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.370 
dog that's built into the latest OS 10
software<00:02:37.270> but<00:02:38.050> by<00:02:38.980> using<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.430> 2d<00:02:39.760> dock<00:02:39.970> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
software but by using the 2d dock it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.949 
software but by using the 2d dock it
just<00:02:41.380> by<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.680> slightly<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:43.000> slightly<00:02:43.120> boost

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
just by the slightly just slightly boost

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.560 
just by the slightly just slightly boost
the<00:02:44.110> performance<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.740> little<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:46.480> you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
the performance a little so but you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.500 
the performance a little so but you
might<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.200> might<00:02:47.230> miss<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.740> video<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.520> some

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
might you might miss that video but some

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.910 
might you might miss that video but some
people<00:02:49.750> actually<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.260> more<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.800> I'm

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
people actually like it more so I'm

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 
people actually like it more so I'm
gonna<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.220> copy<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.880> paste<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.300> into

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
gonna just copy that and paste it into

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.960 
gonna just copy that and paste it into
there<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.990> once<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.950> press<00:02:53.980> ENTER<00:02:54.430> resets

there and once you press ENTER resets

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.240 
there and once you press ENTER resets
the<00:02:55.239> faded<00:02:55.690> off<00:02:55.840> if<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> 3d<00:02:56.739> dog<00:02:56.950> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
the faded off if you have the 3d dog and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.090 
the faded off if you have the 3d dog and
I<00:02:57.430> succeed<00:02:57.790> every<00:02:57.940> dollar<00:02:58.239> 2d<00:02:58.660> dog<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.680> yeah

I succeed every dollar 2d dog so yeah
the<00:03:00.310> 2d<00:03:00.580> dog<00:03:00.760> makes<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.390> ever<00:03:01.989> so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
the 2d dog makes it just ever so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.640 
the 2d dog makes it just ever so
slightly<00:03:02.380> faster<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.239> foodstuff<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.290> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
slightly faster now the foodstuff is to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.580 
slightly faster now the foodstuff is to
remove<00:03:06.100> window<00:03:06.670> open<00:03:07.000> animations<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.840> find

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
remove window open animations I find

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.320 
remove window open animations I find
this<00:03:08.709> one<00:03:08.920> one<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> most<00:03:09.550> effective<00:03:10.120> ones

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
this one one of the most effective ones

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.270 
this one one of the most effective ones
to<00:03:10.720> actually<00:03:10.750> make<00:03:11.110> your<00:03:11.230> Mac<00:03:11.350> faster<00:03:11.860> not

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
to actually make your Mac faster not

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.160 
to actually make your Mac faster not
only<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> Mac<00:03:12.790> faster<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:13.900> open

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
only the Mac faster but to actually open

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.650 
only the Mac faster but to actually open
up<00:03:14.350> applications<00:03:15.100> faster<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.820> find<00:03:16.269> some

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
up applications faster I find some

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.840 
up applications faster I find some
applications<00:03:17.290> open<00:03:17.530> one<00:03:17.920> two<00:03:18.130> three<00:03:18.400> seconds

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
applications open one two three seconds

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.050 
applications open one two three seconds
faster<00:03:19.360> than<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:20.200> original<00:03:21.100> open<00:03:21.760> up<00:03:21.850> times

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
faster than the original open up times

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.479 
faster than the original open up times
like<00:03:22.510> I'll<00:03:22.690> show<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.799> browser<00:03:24.340> i<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.700> here

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
like I'll show you a browser i have here

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.880 
like I'll show you a browser i have here
BAM<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.850> open<00:03:28.180> already<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.530> doesn't<00:03:29.799> even

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
BAM it's open already so it doesn't even

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.979 
BAM it's open already so it doesn't even
it<00:03:30.310> doesn't<00:03:30.640> show<00:03:30.790> like<00:03:31.030> any<00:03:31.209> animations<00:03:31.810> when

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it doesn't show like any animations when

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.039 
it doesn't show like any animations when
it<00:03:32.110> opens<00:03:32.440> um<00:03:32.739> like<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.820> scale<00:03:34.360> animation<00:03:34.930> or

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it opens um like the scale animation or

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.660 
it opens um like the scale animation or
anything<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.530> opens<00:03:35.980> up<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.549> could

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
anything it just opens up so I could

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.289 
anything it just opens up so I could
