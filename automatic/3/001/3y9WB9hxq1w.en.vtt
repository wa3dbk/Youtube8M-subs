00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.630
 Hello 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:11.850
 Introducing a card game called German Amigo 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.850
 As you can see, the game is full of balloons 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:21.890
 This is resurrected, but what a I was out of print in about once Well 7 years ago 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 I have been asking you to revive as you want 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.780
 And 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 I wished I was resurrected 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:35.270
 This is a fun card game 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.270
 Balloons are a card game called Balloons 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.750
 It is a balloon 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 It is such a state if it is born when this balloon is turned over 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.589
 It is said that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.010
 In card one by five players in each 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.430
 Add a balloon card 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.990
 And after this 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.500
 There are 5 colors as appropriate, so 5 balloons are available 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.670
 Hmm 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.150
 Purple to green to red to blue 2 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.370
 Because there are 5 colors , it is good to distribute in 5 colors 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:15.080
 The balloon starts each time and play begins 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:20.200
 Well , it is a card that this end of the card is put in the middle 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.200

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.750

 By the way, if you turn over this card because the nail is a mischievous cat 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.170
 It means that you have to turn the yellow balloon over 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.829
