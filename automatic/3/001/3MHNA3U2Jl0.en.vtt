both built on the Brittany Posey tree
and<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.859> did<00:00:17.270> double<00:00:18.270> J<00:00:18.420> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.020> set

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and what we did double J kind of set

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.410 
and what we did double J kind of set
themselves<00:00:19.949> apart<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.789> came<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
themselves apart they came up with a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
themselves apart they came up with a
system<00:00:21.779> they<00:00:22.050> call<00:00:22.199> high<00:00:22.470> tech<00:00:22.859> which

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
system they call high tech which

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
system they call high tech which
basically<00:00:24.180> means<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> can't<00:00:25.320> really

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
basically means it and I can't really

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
basically means it and I can't really
show<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.189> screen<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.269> underneath

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
show it on screen here but underneath

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.589 
show it on screen here but underneath
where<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.859> stirrup<00:00:29.550> leathers<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.359> hang

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
where the stirrup leathers actually hang

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.930 
where the stirrup leathers actually hang
over<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> bar<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> tree<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
over the bar of the tree they have a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
over the bar of the tree they have a
piece<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.989> stirrup<00:00:34.290> leather<00:00:34.500> hangs

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
piece that the stirrup leather hangs

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
piece that the stirrup leather hangs
through<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> adjustable<00:00:36.390> okay<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
through that is adjustable okay so it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
through that is adjustable okay so it
allows<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> reposition<00:00:38.840> where<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
allows you to reposition where the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.139 
allows you to reposition where the
fender<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.770> hangs<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.520> barrel<00:00:41.820> racers

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
fender actually hangs some barrel racers

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
fender actually hangs some barrel racers
prefer<00:00:42.510> their<00:00:42.660> feet<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.050> forward<00:00:43.440> some

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
prefer their feet to be forward some

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
prefer their feet to be forward some
like<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.190> under<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.910> okay<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.539> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
like them under them okay so this is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
like them under them okay so this is
actually<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> Brittany<00:00:46.500> Posey<00:00:46.950> high-tech

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
actually a Brittany Posey high-tech

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually a Brittany Posey high-tech
barrel<00:00:48.600> racer<00:00:49.020> okay<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.969> tree<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
barrel racer okay so on that tree the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.350 
barrel racer okay so on that tree the
tree<00:00:52.410> itself<00:00:52.829> makes<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> completely<00:00:53.789> unique

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
tree itself makes it completely unique

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
tree itself makes it completely unique
unlike<00:00:54.899> anything<00:00:55.199> else<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> industry<00:00:55.920> but

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
unlike anything else in the industry but

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
on top of that double J has become

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.110 
on top of that double J has become
