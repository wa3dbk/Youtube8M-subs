00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
for the game I've actually had these

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.249 
for the game I've actually had these
ones<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> few<00:00:12.509> days<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:12.719> basically

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.020 
ones for a few days now basically
because<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.490> noticed<00:00:14.670> they've

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
because from what I've noticed they've

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
because from what I've noticed they've
been<00:00:15.150> releasing<00:00:15.480> screenshots<00:00:16.170> every<00:00:16.529> single

been releasing screenshots every single
day<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.789> don't<00:00:18.090> think<00:00:18.330> they're<00:00:18.420> releasing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
day and I don't think they're releasing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.920 
day and I don't think they're releasing
any<00:00:19.230> more<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.939> yeah

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
any more from what I know but yeah

any more from what I know but yeah
basically<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.800> probably<00:00:23.400> shouldn't<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.880> done

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
basically I probably shouldn't have done

basically I probably shouldn't have done
that<00:00:24.090> video<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> other<00:00:24.689> day<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
can see jay from lego ninjago in what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
can see jay from lego ninjago in what
looks<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.160> metropolis<00:00:47.160> because

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
looks to be I think metropolis because

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.860 
looks to be I think metropolis because
if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> left<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
if you look to the left I think I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.000 
if you look to the left I think I
mentioned<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> other<00:00:49.680> video<00:00:49.890> as

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
mentioned this in the other video as

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.200 
mentioned this in the other video as
well<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.910> worth<00:00:51.000> mentioning

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
well but you know it's worth mentioning

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
well but you know it's worth mentioning
again<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.809> guess<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.410> from<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> case<00:00:52.980> people

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
again I guess just from in case people

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
again I guess just from in case people
haven't<00:00:53.550> heard<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:54.120> basically<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> look

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
haven't heard but basically if you look

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
haven't heard but basically if you look
to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> left<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> believe<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.280> actually

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to the left and believe that is actually

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
to the left and believe that is actually
the<00:00:56.760> globe<00:00:57.090> from<00:00:57.600> The<00:00:58.469> Daily<00:00:58.500> Planet<00:00:58.800> building

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the globe from The Daily Planet building

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.439 
the globe from The Daily Planet building
because<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> course<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> big

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
because of course you have that big

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
because of course you have that big
globe<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> top<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.440> Metropolis<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
globe on top of it in Metropolis and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
globe on top of it in Metropolis and
obviously<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.600> pushed<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.080> quite

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
obviously that does get pushed off quite

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
obviously that does get pushed off quite
a<00:01:04.350> few<00:01:04.559> times<00:01:04.799> during<00:01:05.100> battles<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.030> city

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a few times during battles in that city

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
a few times during battles in that city
so<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.260> sense<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so it would make sense that it's on the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
so it would make sense that it's on the
ground<00:01:08.159> right<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.560> left

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
ground right now now also on the left

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
ground right now now also on the left
you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.790> kit<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.240> well

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you can actually see a me kit as well

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can actually see a me kit as well
which<00:01:12.689> keeps<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
which keeps to the you know to the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
which keeps to the you know to the
tradition<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.650> having<00:01:16.799> mini<00:01:17.220> kits

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
tradition of actually having mini kits

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.950 
tradition of actually having mini kits
and<00:01:17.670> gold<00:01:17.850> bricks<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> red<00:01:18.509> bricks<00:01:18.780> and

and gold bricks and red bricks and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
and gold bricks and red bricks and
things<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> lego<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:20.130> yes

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
things because this is a lego game yes
it's<00:01:20.610> toys<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.090> life<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.170> think<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it's toys to life but I think it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.210 
it's toys to life but I think it's
putting<00:01:22.860> its<00:01:23.009> own<00:01:23.130> spin<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.759> toys<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> life<00:01:24.270> by

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
putting its own spin on toys to life by

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.499 
putting its own spin on toys to life by

anything<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.390> maybe<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> was

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
anything like that so maybe that was

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570 
anything like that so maybe that was
accidentally<00:02:58.530> put<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.860> screenshot<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
accidentally put in the screenshot and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.979 
accidentally put in the screenshot and
that's<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.970> comes<00:03:00.209> with<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.450> set<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.810> don't

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
that's like comes with a set we don't

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.420 
that's like comes with a set we don't
know<00:03:01.170> about<00:03:01.319> yet<00:03:01.650> maybe<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.340> another

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
know about yet maybe there's another

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.400 
know about yet maybe there's another
Ninjago<00:03:03.090> character<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.959> about<00:03:04.110> or

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
Ninjago character we don't know about or

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.370 
Ninjago character we don't know about or
maybe<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:06.209> actually<00:03:06.569> belongs<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> enemy

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
maybe it actually belongs to the enemy

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.289 
maybe it actually belongs to the enemy
we<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:07.920> maybe<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.819> actually<00:03:09.150> have

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
we see here maybe they actually have

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.020 
we see here maybe they actually have
their<00:03:09.480> own<00:03:09.769> choices<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.160> things<00:03:11.580> actually

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
their own choices and things actually

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.699 
their own choices and things actually
that<00:03:12.150> would<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.269> really<00:03:12.569> cool<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.410> bring

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that would be really cool like you bring

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.120 
that would be really cool like you bring
in<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.549> giant<00:03:15.000> mech<00:03:15.390> thing<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:16.410> cyborg<00:03:16.890> and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
in a giant mech thing with cyborg and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.440 
in a giant mech thing with cyborg and
then<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.609> enemies<00:03:17.940> actually<00:03:18.239> brings

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
then one of the enemies actually brings

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.630 
then one of the enemies actually brings
in<00:03:18.630> their<00:03:18.780> own<00:03:19.130> mech<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.160> then<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.519> actually

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
in their own mech and then you actually

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.000 
in their own mech and then you actually
have<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> big<00:03:21.060> battle<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:22.079> insane<00:03:22.680> I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
have a big battle that would be insane I

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.220 
have a big battle that would be insane I
mean<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:24.000> possibilities<00:03:24.209> are<00:03:24.690> endless<00:03:24.870> i

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
mean the possibilities are endless i

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.340 
mean the possibilities are endless i
guess<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.709> i<00:03:26.359> have<00:03:27.359> no<00:03:27.570> idea<00:03:27.690> where<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.109> mech

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
guess but i have no idea where this mech

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.050 
guess but i have no idea where this mech
is<00:03:28.470> from<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.010> i<00:03:29.040> hope<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.640> becomes<00:03:29.760> available

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
is from but i hope it becomes available

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.059 
is from but i hope it becomes available
to<00:03:30.540> use<00:03:30.720> because<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.350> look<00:03:31.470> at<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.799> mean

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
to use because just look at it I mean

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.789 
to use because just look at it I mean
the<00:03:32.190> giant<00:03:32.519> swords<00:03:33.030> its<00:03:33.180> massive<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.680> much

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
the giant swords its massive be so much

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.130 
the giant swords its massive be so much
fun<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.069> use<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:35.940> then<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.420> cyborg<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.079> I

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
fun to use now then on to cyborg so I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.960 
fun to use now then on to cyborg so I
believe<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.799> called<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.130> cyber<00:03:38.519> guard

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
believe this is called the cyber guard

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.360 
believe this is called the cyber guard
and<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:40.230> looks<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.739> you'll<00:03:41.010> be<00:03:41.040> able<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> go

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and it looks like you'll be able to go

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.759 
and it looks like you'll be able to go
inside<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.910> from<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.600> know<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> big<00:03:43.109> visor

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
inside it from you know the big visor

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.580 
inside it from you know the big visor
thing<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> mech<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.930> I'm<00:03:46.350> not

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
thing on the on the mech but I'm not

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.110 
thing on the on the mech but I'm not
entirely<00:03:46.859> sure<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.250> mean<00:03:47.459> what<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> think<00:03:47.790> would

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
entirely sure I mean what I think would

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.199 
entirely sure I mean what I think would
be<00:03:48.239> really<00:03:48.269> cool<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:49.950> yes<00:03:50.819> you're<00:03:51.030> playing

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
be really cool is if yes you're playing

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.819 
be really cool is if yes you're playing
cyborg<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.870> your<00:03:51.959> fighting<00:03:52.260> enemies<00:03:52.380> it

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
cyborg in your fighting enemies it

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.069 
cyborg in your fighting enemies it
fights<00:03:53.160> for<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.700> but<00:03:54.150> at<00:03:54.329> any<00:03:54.510> time<00:03:54.870> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
fights for you but at any time you

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.420 
fights for you but at any time you
should<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.319> able<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.560> jump<00:03:55.859> inside<00:03:56.220> it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
should be able to just jump inside it

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.830 
should be able to just jump inside it
and<00:03:56.489> use<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.239> they'll<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.450> really

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and use it I think they'll be really

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.559 
and use it I think they'll be really
cool<00:03:58.049> because<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.530> kind<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:59.030> um<00:04:00.030> think

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
cool because it's kind of like um think

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.240 
cool because it's kind of like um think
of<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.690> as<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.840> smaller<00:04:01.319> version<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:01.950> big

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
of it as a smaller version of the big

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.370 
of it as a smaller version of the big
figure<00:04:02.609> form<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:03.030> cyborg<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.690> Lego<00:04:04.230> Batman

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
figure form of cyborg in Lego Batman

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.870 
figure form of cyborg in Lego Batman
free<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.010> Gotham<00:04:05.370> because<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.700> would<00:04:05.790> be

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
free be on Gotham because that would be

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.539 
free be on Gotham because that would be
really<00:04:06.180> cool<00:04:06.739> now<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.889> is<00:04:07.950> probably<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.519> of

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
really cool now this is probably one of

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.039 
really cool now this is probably one of
my<00:04:08.639> favorite<00:04:09.180> screenshots<00:04:09.720> because

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
my favorite screenshots because

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.920 
my favorite screenshots because
basically<00:04:10.500> sums<00:04:11.400> up<00:04:11.639> Lego<00:04:11.850> dimensions<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.720> one
