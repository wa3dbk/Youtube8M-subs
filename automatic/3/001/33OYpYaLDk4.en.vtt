00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
about it's the ugliest motor ever seen

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.570 
about it's the ugliest motor ever seen
to<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:28.869> that's<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:29.650> best<00:00:29.949> looking<00:00:30.250> engine

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
to that that's the best looking engine

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.320 
to that that's the best looking engine
ever<00:00:30.939> saved

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330

personally I love the new look at the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680 
personally I love the new look at the
motor<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.520> I<00:00:33.670> wonder<00:00:34.030> if<00:00:34.090> one<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.450> things

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
motor and I wonder if one of the things

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.479 
motor and I wonder if one of the things
I<00:00:34.809> really<00:00:35.260> like<00:00:35.469> about<00:00:35.500> it<00:00:35.829> is<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.129> can

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
I really like about it is you can

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.369 
I really like about it is you can
customize<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:37.420> colors<00:00:37.809> there's<00:00:38.020> literally

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
customize the colors there's literally

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.920 
customize the colors there's literally
hundreds<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.280> different<00:00:39.460> options<00:00:39.910> as<00:00:40.510> you<00:00:40.600> can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
hundreds of different options as you can

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.840 
hundreds of different options as you can
see<00:00:41.110> I<00:00:41.320> went<00:00:41.590> with<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.829> black<00:00:42.039> side<00:00:42.309> panels

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
see I went with the black side panels

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.430 
see I went with the black side panels
and<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.090> yellow<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.360> silver<00:00:43.660> stripes<00:00:44.170> on

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
and the yellow and silver stripes on

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.350 
and the yellow and silver stripes on
there<00:00:44.680> really<00:00:45.160> goes<00:00:45.370> great<00:00:45.850> with<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.180> whole

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
there really goes great with the whole

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.180 
there really goes great with the whole
look<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.840> wrap<00:00:47.050> of<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.350> boat<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.890> trunk

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
look of the wrap of the boat the trunk

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.000 
look of the wrap of the boat the trunk
so<00:00:48.789> it<00:00:49.120> allows<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.079> customize<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.829> you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
so it allows you to customize that you

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.680 
so it allows you to customize that you
can<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.190> red<00:00:51.460> ones<00:00:51.670> green<00:00:51.760> ones<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.270> name<00:00:52.510> it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
can get red ones green ones you name it

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.209 
can get red ones green ones you name it
but<00:00:53.140> that's<00:00:53.289> just<00:00:53.500> some<00:00:53.710> of<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.890> aesthetics

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
but that's just some of the aesthetics

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.130 
but that's just some of the aesthetics
what's<00:00:54.640> really<00:00:55.059> important<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.480> me<00:00:55.570> on<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.020> new

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
what's really important to me on the new

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.029 
what's really important to me on the new
g2<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.879> speed<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.750> love<00:00:59.500> how<00:00:59.859> much

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
g2 is the speed of it I love how much

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.740 
g2 is the speed of it I love how much
faster<00:01:00.489> I'm<00:01:00.579> going<00:01:00.879> right<00:01:01.000> now<00:01:01.059> I'm<00:01:01.480> talking

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
faster I'm going right now I'm talking

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.560 
faster I'm going right now I'm talking
to<00:01:01.930> mid<00:01:02.140> sec<00:01:02.530> mid<00:01:03.039> 70s<00:01:03.789> in<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.090> boat<00:01:04.300> right

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to mid sec mid 70s in this boat right

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.979 
to mid sec mid 70s in this boat right
here

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
here

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.900 
here
it's<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.590> good<00:01:05.800> three<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.190> four<00:01:06.430> Mountain<00:01:06.730> hours

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
it's a good three to four Mountain hours

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.300 
it's a good three to four Mountain hours
faster<00:01:07.600> than<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> same<00:01:08.380> set<00:01:08.650> up<00:01:08.770> ahead<00:01:09.070> last

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
faster than the same set up ahead last

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.910 
faster than the same set up ahead last
year<00:01:09.610> with<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.180> older<00:01:10.510> style<00:01:10.780> every<00:01:11.230> detail

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
year with the older style every detail

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.190 
year with the older style every detail
so<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.580> I've<00:01:12.910> gained<00:01:13.210> that<00:01:13.390> much<00:01:13.450> more<00:01:13.870> speed

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
so that I've gained that much more speed

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.770 
so that I've gained that much more speed
and<00:01:14.950> you'd<00:01:15.220> think<00:01:15.400> well<00:01:15.700> with<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.060> what's<00:01:16.690> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
and you'd think well with the what's the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.280 
and you'd think well with the what's the
trade-off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
trade-off

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.200 
trade-off
you<00:01:17.440> know<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.650> gain<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:18.220> you<00:01:18.430> lose<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.910> I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
you know you gain this you lose that I'm

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.660 
you know you gain this you lose that I'm
the<00:01:19.510> g2<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:19.960> have<00:01:20.290> not<00:01:20.620> lost<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.490> I've

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
the g2 I have not lost a that I've

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.990 
the g2 I have not lost a that I've
gained<00:01:22.060> more<00:01:22.750> speed<00:01:23.430> incredibly<00:01:24.430> more<00:01:24.610> torque

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
gained more speed incredibly more torque

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
gained more speed incredibly more torque
that's<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:25.870> cool<00:01:26.080> that's<00:01:26.140> what<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.710> really

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
that's so cool that's what you really

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.010 
that's so cool that's what you really
feel<00:01:27.400> when<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.730> talk<00:01:28.060> about<00:01:28.090> hole<00:01:28.510> shots

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
feel when you talk about hole shots

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.570 
feel when you talk about hole shots
this<00:01:29.200> one<00:01:29.380> right<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.620> gives<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.340> whip

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
this one right here gives you the whip

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.670 
this one right here gives you the whip
punch<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.660> other<00:01:31.810> thing<00:01:32.050> that's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.320> big

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
punch and the other thing that's a big

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.860 
punch and the other thing that's a big
advantage<00:01:32.830> about<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.270> fuel<00:01:34.540> economy

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
advantage about it is the fuel economy

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.590 
advantage about it is the fuel economy
way<00:01:35.560> better<00:01:35.890> fuel<00:01:36.220> economy<00:01:36.400> I'm<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.300> impressed

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
way better fuel economy I'm so impressed

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.170 
way better fuel economy I'm so impressed
with<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.990> motor<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.950> has<00:01:38.980> done<00:01:39.310> everything<00:01:39.760> I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180
