gameplay real quickly before i get into

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.549 
gameplay real quickly before i get into
it<00:00:34.739> um<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.660> pendas<00:00:36.660> gameplay<00:00:37.079> you'll<00:00:37.260> see

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.000 
it um one pendas gameplay you'll see
that<00:00:37.829> i<00:00:38.899> made<00:00:39.899> her<00:00:40.110> stage<00:00:40.320> crew<00:00:40.500> i<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.800> we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that i made her stage crew i think we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.069 
that i made her stage crew i think we're
all<00:00:41.129> 8<00:00:41.340> prestige<00:00:41.790> couples<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.780> 9th<00:00:42.930> or

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
all 8 prestige couples on 9th or

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
all 8 prestige couples on 9th or
something<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.840> did<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
something so that's because we did the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
something so that's because we did the
prestige<00:00:46.410> glitch<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
prestige glitch like way back when you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.889 
prestige glitch like way back when you
know<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.059> first<00:00:48.239> came<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> fear

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
know when i first came out that fear

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
know when i first came out that fear
mode<00:00:49.170> 1<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.500> whatever<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> guess<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.480> would

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mode 1 or whatever so I guess that would

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.330 
mode 1 or whatever so I guess that would
tell<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:51.930> old<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.350> gameplay<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
tell you how old this gameplay is and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
tell you how old this gameplay is and
I've<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> gotta<00:00:54.239> reset<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
I've all you gotta reset for that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
I've all you gotta reset for that
whatever<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.590> i'm<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.460> seven

whatever and i'm actually back at seven

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.459 
whatever and i'm actually back at seven

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
late and too is in the beginning here I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.020 
late and too is in the beginning here I
think<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.240> um<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:11.010> quite<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
deaths this game and I think in the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
deaths this game and I think in the
beginning<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> say<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
beginning that right there you say have

beginning that right there you say have
19<00:01:15.990> death<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> whirling<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> second<00:01:17.159> round<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
19 death and whirling the second round I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
19 death and whirling the second round I
finished<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> game<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.900> 30<00:01:19.350> deaths<00:01:19.680> I

out<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.390> they're<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.720> fucked<00:01:40.380> us<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
out and they're actually fucked us up in

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
out and they're actually fucked us up in
the<00:01:40.890> first<00:01:40.979> round<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.810> that's<00:01:42.810> why<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:42.990> got

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the first round so that's why i got

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.330 
the first round so that's why i got
quite<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> few<00:01:43.680> deaths<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.040> game<00:01:44.189> play<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
quite a few deaths in this game play and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.039 
quite a few deaths in this game play and
plus<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> map<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.479> harder<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.930> hold

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
plus this map is a lot harder to hold

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.310 
plus this map is a lot harder to hold
down<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:47.210> hijacked<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.659> there's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:49.290> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
down then hijacked is there's a lot more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
down then hijacked is there's a lot more
spawn<00:01:49.649> points<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.270> there

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
spawn points and as you can see there

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.929 
spawn points and as you can see there
are<00:01:51.479> Guardians<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.229> stuff<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:53.040> now

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
are Guardians up and stuff because now

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.690 
are Guardians up and stuff because now
if<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> put<00:01:54.360> Guardians<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.310> flips<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
if you put Guardians up the it flips the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
if you put Guardians up the it flips the
spawn<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> can't<00:01:57.659> can't<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.380> Guardians

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
spawn so you can't can't put Guardians

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
spawn so you can't can't put Guardians
anymore<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.790> really<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.210> Mavs

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
anymore so we don't really do this Mavs

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.080 
anymore so we don't really do this Mavs
anymore<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:00.840> um<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.759> hard<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
anymore because um it's very hard to do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
anymore because um it's very hard to do
without<00:02:03.270> Guardians<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:04.619> much

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
without Guardians it's pretty much

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.929 
without Guardians it's pretty much
impossible<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.579> more<00:02:05.610> than

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
impossible because there is more than

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.740 
impossible because there is more than
six<00:02:06.270> spawn<00:02:06.509> points<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> pretty<00:02:09.000> much<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.720> know

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
six spawn points so pretty much you know

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
six spawn points so pretty much you know
there's<00:02:10.679> only<00:02:10.770> six<00:02:11.039> people<00:02:11.310> there's<00:02:11.580> more

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
there's only six people there's more

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.370 
there's only six people there's more
than<00:02:11.879> 61<00:02:12.150> points<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.690> doesn't<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.020> work

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
than 61 points so it doesn't really work

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.700 
than 61 points so it doesn't really work
cow<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> yes<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.780> each<00:02:16.050> tile<00:02:16.260> bring<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.620> you

ground<00:03:12.510> war<00:03:12.720> solo<00:03:13.140> hundred<00:03:13.410> places<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.920> I

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
ground war solo hundred places so I

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.320 
ground war solo hundred places so I
figured<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:14.550> time<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> start<00:03:14.820> busting<00:03:15.240> out

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
figured about time to start busting out

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.200 
figured about time to start busting out
some<00:03:15.360> Von<00:03:15.720> Trapps<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.070> yeah<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.120> was

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
some Von Trapps so yeah just that was

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.030 
some Von Trapps so yeah just that was
just<00:03:18.360> because<00:03:18.420> people<00:03:19.200> would<00:03:19.290> cry<00:03:19.470> about<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
just because people would cry about if I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.470 
just because people would cry about if I
did<00:03:20.250> straight<00:03:20.670> spawn<00:03:20.880> trapping<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
did straight spawn trapping from the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.150 
did straight spawn trapping from the
beginning<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.080> yeah<00:03:22.200> that's<00:03:22.620> pretty<00:03:22.770> much<00:03:22.980> why

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
beginning so yeah that's pretty much why

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.910 
beginning so yeah that's pretty much why
I<00:03:23.190> did<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.080> do<00:03:25.320> have<00:03:25.470> quite<00:03:25.860> a
