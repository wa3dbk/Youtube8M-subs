00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
 hello shell heads 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.690
 today I will make a criticism of my favorite company 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.969
 which is well known for its famous logo of the manzanita 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.749
 this company is apple 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.049
 as you know this company is the inventor of mac computers with its 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.970
 mac system also created the number one portable player in the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.619
 present that is alcohol 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.759
 and the smartphone that caused a revolution in 2007 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.319
 with its great touch interface and that huge screen that we all like 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.970
 I'm talking about the iphone 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.890
 that although it is not the number one phone currently 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.460
 is one of the most coveted and has been a source of inspiration for the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.320
 cellular manufacturers will start with the development of touch screens 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 for your phones 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.700
 companies like nokia 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.810
 which in my opinion is the most obsolete of all with its odious operating system 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.480
 symbian 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.390
 has already released its first touchscreen cell phone which is 58 0 0 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.360
 but not everything is rosy with the company of the apple but there is 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 many things that have to improve 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 we'll start with the mac 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.560
 these computers are in my opinion the most beautiful you can find in the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.840
 world and have been manufactured with high quality material include a very 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 good garden 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 you can set them up as you want and buy them in thor footbaths and include the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.210
 operating system better qualified by various means of communication in addition 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.780
 that you have the option to run windows and mac or that in the same 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.820
 computer 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 sounds really good 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.630
 but here are the cons 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 maco that is sold separately 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 but if you want to run it on the nice computer that you have armed yourself with a lot 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.799
 apple effort that kicked the ass with your license contract which you 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.430
 it says very clearly that you can not install this operating system if you do not 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.650
 Do you have a Mac 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.060
 Well, it can be a leading company 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 they do not realize that macs are also the most expensive computers 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.620
 and there are many people who are dying to have this system 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.979
 but that they do not have as many resources as to buy that bitch of mack 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.920
 that is costing you over 15 thousand pesos for a macbook with the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.500
 cheapest configuration 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.540
 while you shit your fucking mother to see only the 10 thousand that you load in 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.540
 your wall sa wallet that you bought five years ago 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.309
 we will talk about the ipo 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.359
 this player is not doing as well as the mac 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.509
 asthma cable wonders but this player if I'm going to fuck 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.180
 as possessor of a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.349
 I think it's a very expensive player for what it does 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.560
 it does not have a voice recorder which is very useful when there is a talk 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.189
 that you do not want to forget 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.819
 does not include a radio 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.480
 in case you thought to use this player to hear the mediocre newscast of the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.259
 tomorrow you listen to every day at home with your recording appointment 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.200
 what does include this egg player are many models 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.830
 to get the juice that is left in your brain while deciding if you 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.250
 shopping a social mortgage 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.279
 a nano ipod 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:51.359
 a mortgage sic 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.430
 ou modern axo toux that will leave you without a ticket in your pocket 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.699
 what you also have in the air because even the touch is a part 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.399
 metal back that is scratched only with leaving your fingerprint marked 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.409
 there is why or fine has a screen and not even buttons 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.189
 which are included in the hearing aids 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.289
 then if you break down the hearing aids goods worth mothers 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.200
 the only one that has been saved is the iphone nano 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.529
 with a very good price 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.149
 functions and capacity 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.309
 now let me tell you about your majesty the iphone 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.549
 this phone seems invincible 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.899
 but it has many weak points 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.289
 apple decided to close its operating system to the developers of 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:31.029
 software 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.439
 and then give them a chance with the condition that the applications do not 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.540
 could run in the background 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.739
 you could not make modifications to the operating system 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.489
 besides that if you did all that you still had to go through a rigorous examination 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.759
 i many good here cations went to hell 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.489
 as possessor of one and font 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.090
 if you do not have the llibret 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.629
 this phone is as boring as you can imagine 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.579
 I know that's why I have to install lots of applications 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.959
 third parties that were not approved personalize my phone use it with 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.079
 any telephone network and install applications crackeada if free that 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.699
 many people have come down from the apes torfs so they do not pay a penny for the 27 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.649
 games that I have on my iphone 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:14.419
 LOL 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.549
 burned today 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.350
 I will tell you that with my iphone the past hours and hours of fun playing with 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.910
 that ball of cracked games only that I have to connect it to the damn charger 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.729
 because the battery does not last long 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.939
 another of the cons of this phone 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.220
 the president of api 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.610
 which I respect a lot hahaha is called estis jobs 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.120
 the bad thing is that he has ideas very different from mine from how to be a 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.229
 leading company that if it were more open with its products would have gained more 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.520
 money and it would have gone much better to this asshole 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.300
 well I do not want to bore 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.419
 so with this out 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.710
 I see them in another video
