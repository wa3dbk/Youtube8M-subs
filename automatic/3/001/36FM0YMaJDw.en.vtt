 so a few cautionary tips for this week even though actually the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.039
 snow is there even if you are good skiers even if you have 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.970
 strongly want to do things and that you are well prepared 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.889
 brothers 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.699
 I remember some tips if you want on the slopes you have to stay 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.770
 watchful you must respect the other members always watch the skiers 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.850
 downstream you know it I repeat you were still mastering your 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.629
 speed with your trajectory you're not alone there sometimes if you 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.919
 want it confluence fire two skiers blisters and surfers so 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.710
 respective do not stop anywhere when we stop on a 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.039
 track in bag at the edge of the track 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.139
 be careful not to put yourself in danger of allowing so much away 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.919
 respective signaling on the stakes this is very important 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.039
 respect the safety rules but on the ski lifts on the 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.060
 chairlifts do not throw anything and from your phone that this 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.229
 either a can or possibly a cigarette butt 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.189
 listen to think about nature with everything you need to keep it on you and 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.259
 throw it in the trash and then in case of accidents well to them there 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.000
 sit down to help others by giving the alert everything is 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.210
 mentally if you are first-aiders by practicing some first aid 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.879
 but moreover to give the alert to the service of the tracks to the services of 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.270
 help 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.629

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:47.930
 March 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 a little look at the calendar that tells us the che the show to the saint 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.069
 Joseph the 19th 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.599
 summer will be brief 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.689
 in March it disguises in summer it's a bit of a blues 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.419
 so he takes his stuffed clothes 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.110
 and when it freezes on March 20 banks look good on March 20 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.650
 it freezes all year so put a little cross on the calendar like that 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.050
 at Damascus time you will see if the saying goes true when in March it barely 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.389
 the year will be good listening we have not heard thomert yet but hey
