uh<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.700> know<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:01.060> basically<00:02:01.600> slow<00:02:02.259> slides

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
uh you know like basically slow slides

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.169 
uh you know like basically slow slides
you<00:02:03.039> know<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.520> can<00:02:03.670> really<00:02:03.969> easily

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.009 
down the hill I'd gone through a small
Santa<00:02:48.640> trees<00:02:48.879> and<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.269> watch<00:02:49.480> those<00:02:49.780> things

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
Santa trees and just watch those things

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.250 
Santa trees and just watch those things
snap<00:02:50.379> in<00:02:50.590> front<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:52.299> way<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.569> felt<00:02:53.019> that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
snap in front of me the way I felt that

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.050 
snap in front of me the way I felt that
my<00:02:53.410> body<00:02:53.709> was<00:02:56.459> unbearable<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.639> I<00:02:57.760> thought<00:02:58.000> I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
my body was unbearable like I thought I

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.120 
my body was unbearable like I thought I
was<00:02:58.239> basically<00:02:58.720> gonna<00:02:58.959> explode<00:02:59.560> look<00:02:59.920> I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
was basically gonna explode look I

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.920 
was basically gonna explode look I
didn't<00:03:00.609> see<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> slapper<00:03:01.359> I<00:03:01.389> just<00:03:01.660> thought<00:03:01.780> it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
didn't see the slapper I just thought it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
didn't see the slapper I just thought it
was<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.200> little<00:03:02.410> famine<00:03:04.769> yeah<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.010> then

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
was like a little famine yeah and then

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.690 
was like a little famine yeah and then
at<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.569> very<00:03:07.600> end<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.829> could<00:03:09.280> feel<00:03:09.519> myself

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
at the very end I could feel myself

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.559 
at the very end I could feel myself
coming<00:03:10.180> out<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.049> basically<00:03:12.569> popped

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
coming out of it and I basically popped

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.900 
coming out of it and I basically popped
out<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:14.170> top<00:03:14.410> right<00:03:14.859> at<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.370> toe<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.609> this

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
out on top right at the toe of this

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.569 
out on top right at the toe of this
thing<00:03:16.180> after<00:03:17.139> riding<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.859> for<00:03:17.889> mm<00:03:20.340> I've<00:03:21.340> taken

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
thing after riding it for mm I've taken

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.080 
thing after riding it for mm I've taken
credit<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> fought<00:03:22.750> my<00:03:22.900> way<00:03:23.079> out<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.500> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
credit that I fought my way out of it I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.800 
credit that I fought my way out of it I
got<00:03:25.090> let<00:03:25.299> go

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
got let go

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.470 
got let go
it<00:03:26.260> wasn't<00:03:26.590> really<00:03:26.799> my<00:03:26.950> decision<00:03:27.549> it's<00:03:28.090> tricky

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
it wasn't really my decision it's tricky

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.539 
it wasn't really my decision it's tricky
out<00:03:28.750> there<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.319> know<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.530> get<00:03:29.739> reinforced<00:03:30.400> in

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
out there you know you get reinforced in

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.259 
out there you know you get reinforced in
all<00:03:30.669> these<00:03:30.790> different<00:03:30.940> ways<00:03:31.150> about<00:03:33.269> thinking

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
all these different ways about thinking

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.300 
all these different ways about thinking
you're<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.599> control<00:03:34.930> or<00:03:35.470> thinking<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you're in control or thinking that you

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.470 
you're in control or thinking that you
can<00:03:36.489> manage<00:03:36.700> something<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:38.109> was<00:03:38.230> dangerous

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
can manage something that was dangerous

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.460 

and<00:03:40.599> then<00:03:40.840> at<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.739> most<00:03:41.950> unlikely<00:03:42.610> moment<00:03:43.470> you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and then at the most unlikely moment you

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.259 
and then at the most unlikely moment you
can<00:03:44.650> get<00:03:44.800> caught<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.610> know<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.730> thought<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.030> was

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
can get caught you know I thought I was

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.009 
can get caught you know I thought I was
in<00:03:46.390> complete<00:03:46.629> control<00:03:47.370> until<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.430> wasn't<00:03:49.019> it

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
in complete control until I wasn't it

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.449 
in complete control until I wasn't it
just<00:03:50.170> goes<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.590> show<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.830> got<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.040> be<00:03:51.129> on<00:03:51.280> your

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
just goes to show you got to be on your

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.550 
just goes to show you got to be on your
game<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.910> whole<00:03:52.090> way<00:03:52.300> through<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.930> there's<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
game the whole way through and there's a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.110 
game the whole way through and there's a
lot<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.129> ways<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.459> get<00:03:54.580> smoked<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
lot of ways to get smoked in the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.150 
lot of ways to get smoked in the
mountains<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:55.810> not<00:03:55.989> just<00:03:56.319> up<00:03:56.650> right<00:03:57.010> in

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
mountains and it's not just up right in

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.009 
mountains and it's not just up right in
the<00:03:57.190> gnar<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.540> know<00:03:58.660> an<00:03:58.810> incident<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.380> that

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
the gnar you know an incident like that

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.070 
the gnar you know an incident like that
changes<00:04:02.019> your<00:04:02.410> life<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.580> changes<00:04:04.150> how<00:04:05.019> you

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
changes your life and it changes how you

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.720 
changes your life and it changes how you
look<00:04:05.290> at<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> mountains<00:04:05.890> from<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.250> point<00:04:06.519> on

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
look at the mountains from that point on

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.910 
look at the mountains from that point on
and<00:04:07.090> if<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.330> doesn't<00:04:07.599> then<00:04:08.700> you're<00:04:09.700> an<00:04:09.819> idiot
