00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.900
 and smart people talk about ideas the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 ordinary people talk about things and people 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.210
 mediocre talks about others are not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.640
 taught that the people who criticize are for 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 envy because it is projected or by 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 insecurity told us that with the rod 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 that you measure will be measured that we should not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.969
 judge others not to be judged 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.190
 and that you do not have to look at the straw in your eye 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.190
 that if not the beam in the act itself 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.710
 they have noticed that the people who 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 criticism is the one that is most dissatisfied 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.320
 with his life and generally criticizes something 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 that she always criticizes you is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.219
 because we are upset because we judge 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.379
 the other person is not acting 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.120
 the way we want correct we do not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 we realize that we are giving 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 reality only to an idea that does not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.619
 we could have let go of the other person not 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.360
 is doing nothing to us and yet what 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.590
 that really bothers us 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.600
 the judgment we make about their 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 behavior and this affects us 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 directly when we criticize we are 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 sending an order to the unconscious of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 that we can be judged so 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 same and this becomes a decree 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 because everything that comes out of us 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 collects similar energy on the road and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 come back to us multiplied each 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 criticism is a rejection means that no 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.760
 I'm accepting things as they are that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 I'm not flowing and at this time no 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.670
 I'm happy because a happy person does not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670
 review 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.210
 the criticism generates a very dense energy 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.280
 and negative that in a certain way we 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.050
 contaminates until the simple call of a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 friend to speak ill of another you can 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 leave without energy on the basis that all 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.010
 we are one any energy hit that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 you want to find the other one does it to you 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.210
 same how many times did they give you the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.310
 information of a person and by your 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.950
 judgments I made a bad reference already 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.259
 because of that he was left without work 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 friends or without a relationship how many times 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.340
 You have generated gossip lawsuits 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.619
 Distances or even misfortunes 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 with your negative comments how many 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.150
 more even talked bad about someone without 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 I can tell you what you are saying never 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.959
 we realize the damage we can 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.300
 do with your mouth until the year is 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.340
 done and the worst thing is that we do it to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.060
 ourselves, everything goes back 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.190
 Interestingly 70% of people 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 who judges for an error is because what 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.560
 commit and 30% is because I would like 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.510
 do you have to think that of not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.610
 be for an error that you committed not 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.980
 you would have arrived where these miseries the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.570
 person who are the errors are the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.980
 greatest blessings when 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.690
 we learn the lesson 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 they are the bridges that we have to cross 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.280
 to arrive at the awakening of our 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.780
 consciousness to know the light we had 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 that having first met the darkness 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.920
 the more you love and values your 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.710
 decisions less should matter what 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.780
 tell others if we are willing to 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.970
 drop all the judgments and we begin to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 see the other innocents then 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 we can see the innocence in us 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.030
 themselves and we will experience our 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.370
 true be I propose to keep a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.800
 neutrality wise let the voice of the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.500
 spirit corrects our perception and 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 choose to love instead of judging like that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.340
 we will find peace and as the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 said when you want to meet a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.600
 person do not listen to what the others 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.440
 they say of her listen what that person 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.440
 says of others
