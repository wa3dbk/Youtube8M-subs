through a corner I think I like about
this<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.520> well<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.630> engine<00:01:43.640> lets<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.849> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this as well the engine lets out a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.419 
this as well the engine lets out a
really<00:01:45.539> nice<00:01:45.899> whale<00:01:46.440> when<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.250> give

your principal fuel economy mode which

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.750 
your principal fuel economy mode which
is<00:02:51.209> probably<00:02:51.750> what<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.049> assume<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:53.190> Lexus

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is probably what I assume that Lexus

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.559 
is probably what I assume that Lexus
have<00:02:53.940> used<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.389> get<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> 10.8<00:02:55.290> liters<00:02:55.620> per<00:02:55.829> 100

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
have used to get the 10.8 liters per 100

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.720 
have used to get the 10.8 liters per 100
fuel<00:02:57.569> economy<00:02:57.810> which<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.739> something<00:02:59.430> we

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
fuel economy which is something we

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.729 
fuel economy which is something we
haven't<00:02:59.760> really<00:03:00.090> touched<00:03:00.540> because<00:03:00.930> that's

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
haven't really touched because that's

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.979 
haven't really touched because that's
not<00:03:02.010> what<00:03:02.160> we're<00:03:02.340> about

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
not what we're about

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.500 
not what we're about
sports<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.170> sports<00:03:04.410> plus<00:03:04.709> are<00:03:04.950> quite<00:03:05.160> nice

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
sports and sports plus are quite nice

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
sports and sports plus are quite nice
with<00:03:06.510> differences<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.950> power

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
with differences there in the power

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.180 
with differences there in the power
delivery<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.970> shift<00:03:09.239> lengths<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.410> your

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
delivery the shift lengths and your

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.190 
delivery the shift lengths and your
torque<00:03:11.639> vectoring<00:03:12.120> differential<00:03:12.660> which<00:03:13.049> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
torque vectoring differential which is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.089 
torque vectoring differential which is
one<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.560> Lexus's<00:03:14.519> main<00:03:15.650> events<00:03:16.650> for<00:03:16.950> this

I<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.070> telling<00:03:29.280> me<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.580> behave
