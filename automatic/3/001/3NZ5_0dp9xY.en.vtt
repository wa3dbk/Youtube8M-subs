90 minutes I think every game has been a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
90 minutes I think every game has been a
great<00:01:15.840> show<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> fans

think on both teams you have players who

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.330 
think on both teams you have players who
have<00:01:55.350> done<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.829> their<00:01:55.979> respective

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
have been tremendous battles the first

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
have been tremendous battles the first
game<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:04.590> attacking<00:02:04.979> battle

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
game was I think an attacking battle

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.690 
game was I think an attacking battle
both<00:02:06.299> teams<00:02:06.600> had<00:02:06.840> great<00:02:07.649> opportunities<00:02:07.700> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
both teams had great opportunities and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.540 
both teams had great opportunities and
keepers<00:02:09.390> came<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.840> huge<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.500> saves<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.009> then

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
keepers came up huge with saves and then

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
keepers came up huge with saves and then
the<00:02:11.910> second<00:02:12.270> game<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> little<00:02:12.810> bit<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the second game was a little bit more of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.700 
the second game was a little bit more of
a<00:02:13.200> midfield

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
a midfield

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.410 
a midfield
battle<00:02:13.980> neither<00:02:14.190> team<00:02:14.490> really<00:02:14.970> broke<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
battle neither team really broke the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540 
battle neither team really broke the
other<00:02:15.540> team<00:02:15.840> down<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.070> neither<00:02:17.280> team

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
other team down and neither team

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
other team down and neither team
finished<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> few<00:02:18.450> opportunities<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.230> they

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
finished the few opportunities that they

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.010 
finished the few opportunities that they
had<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:21.090> next<00:02:21.270> game<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.750> going

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.180 
behind in the beginning of season I've
done<00:03:03.840> really<00:03:04.050> well<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.410> end<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.680> season<00:03:04.860> so

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
done really well at the end of season so

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.390 
done really well at the end of season so
they're<00:03:05.730> also<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.620> long<00:03:07.770> winning<00:03:08.100> streak

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
they're also on on a long winning streak

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800 
they're also on on a long winning streak
and<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.240> we<00:03:09.390> need<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.570> player

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and so I think that we need a player

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.030 
and so I think that we need a player
about<00:03:10.020> soccer<00:03:10.260> if<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.530> want<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.740> come<00:03:10.860> out<00:03:10.920> on

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
about soccer if we want to come out on

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
about soccer if we want to come out on
