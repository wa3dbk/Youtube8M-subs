00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.830
 Hello yourself Saens but damn it 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.980
 Vasilevich 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.160
 and today we went to conquer the roads 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.949
 on Chinese SUVs and pickups and and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.390
 Magritte Wolf is now on a6 we will try 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 get on this hill 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.300
 In principle, we have already come here. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.680
 say it will cover a little bit 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.830
 non-uniform whether and respectively from 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.720
 6 on velcro he certainly tries 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.720
 trying legs like we are now 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.710
 demonstrate it clearly and 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.350
 accordingly it will be seen as twisting 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.350
 moment flies between the wheels 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.580
 by feeling in general that car 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.370
 almost strained 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.940
 but it should be noted that this car 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 a little more forced chip vovan and 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.170
 approximately now in one and a half 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 liter turbo engine gives out somewhere 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 170 horsepower though let's say so on 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.770
 bottoms anyway there is some such 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 a small turbo pitted a little less already 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.010
 and became something Chipovka but still she 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.369
 and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.590
 and so haldex clutch in the form in which 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.740
 she is represented by clay nogri twilight 6 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 it's a clutch which let's say is not there no 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 electronic but here in this car 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.590
 no electronic locking imitation 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.450
 rain differential lock and no 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 such off-road modes like let it go 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 On land rover models, that is, you can 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.300
 choose mud sand snow and so on 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 down here is a clean haldex as it is and so 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.550
 does not burn throw 6 now try 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.850
 diagonal hanging first on 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.450
 low speed ie see how 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.450
 as if coping 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.460
 here 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.719
 that is, the wheel is hung out and 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.709
 respectively torque 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.819
 passed on to him 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.480
 but if we take the speed a little 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.790
 more 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.700
 many will say that you're losing I'm here to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.220
 my knees will drive it wrong because 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.110
 here itâ€™s pretty slippery anyway 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.849
 your knees you hang at least long 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 some will give one of the front wheels and 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.970
 immediately become and now we try on 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.950
 high speed 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.019
 well, a little more let's say not big 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.519
 of course we kill 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.739
 here pay attention how fast 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.640
 torque spill over from the wheel 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.060
 on the wheel 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.459
 so on the great wave of course 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.380
 almost possible to overcome here and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.470
 diagonal hanging and slippery 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.709
 rise and but this is exactly great pag 56 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.110
 with haldex coupling now we have already taken 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.209
 equal edg3 and with turbo 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.470
 engine 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.540
 car of course cool rides 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.120
 interesting inside but about this we had 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.610
 already another vidos we talked about this 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.299
 Now we are trying exactly such well 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.350
 off-road vehicle capacity 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.489
 about to hillock to which we are now 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.120
 stopped by these 6 respectively but 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.970
 car running 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 diagonal hanging overcomes in 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.870
 tightness, respectively, can not 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.459
 for those who thought right now here 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.299
 you can drive us about on the natural 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.709
 cars 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.319
 Well, we disable the front-wheel drive is now at 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.170
 a4 models there you can ride in the back 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.030
 drive, respectively, try to call 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.319
 But on the same hill where 6 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.769
 accordingly climbed without problems 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.769
 we try 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.220
 in fact this is not the first attempt 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.800
 tried and in the tension and speed 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.000
 nothing turns on turn on mode 4th 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.710
 and so now Anton Vasilievich 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.970
 I'll try to drive here on this slide 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.860
 Mode 4th rear-wheel drive is needed 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.010
 tried how it works u now full 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.400
 drive forward 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.710
 easy walk wheel a little bit 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.710
 come off the utility too a little bit 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.320
 a little grocery walk was and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.550
 the car continued smoothly well 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.870
 actually and what would you like to 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.390
 frame real SUV 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.010
 against the urban SUV in general 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.920
 but let's say we are not today 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.980
 exhibit against each other were on 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.140
 actually appreciate and those are the potential 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.440
 which is laid in each of the cars 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.440
 yes and h3 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 IS-6 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.960
 trying to pull out the stuck baby 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.960
 and 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.849
 but they themselves saw it with their own eyes 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:29.210
 there is a velcro same installed on and 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.909
 4 respectively on ice traction 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.379
 which we have on top of course there 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.940
 not very good therefore from here and 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:41.000
 slip from here respectively and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.949
 I also had to gain a little speed 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.569
 for overclocking, respectively, we have 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.370
 what conclusion can we make if 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.289
 going to winter off-road 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.909
 take spikes and because off-road 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.270
 still sometimes there is ice not 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.930
 what's in the city but among these two 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.720
 cars 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.360
 edg3 there are six principle here, too, everything 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.740
 it is clear if you are a fisherman if you are a summer resident 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.440
 if you need an SUV 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.880
 if you need a frame SUV floor 3 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.610
 if you need a SUV for the city and you 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.979
 love to go on picnics in nature but 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.610
 don't you conquer the roads every 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.389
 weekends 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.930
 then your choice will be all the same 6 and so here 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.990
 and such a wonderful action came up with 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.050
 Great Wall 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.409
 today we tried 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.630
 these cars on health tested 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:37.980
 let's say so different systems complete 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:43.800
 drive showed how they differ 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:46.950
 burned scarecrow spent shrovetide on spruce 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.290
 meat and just had a great time 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.020
 Another important factor is Great Wall 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:56.880
 pulled a Toyota but to this question and to 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.130
 many others including Great Wall 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:06.150
 and we will come back thanks to our friends 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:08.280
 from the ring of the company which 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.080
 provided us with a car for the test 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.140
 who were with us today organized 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.800
 here this event thanks them thank you 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.410
 you 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.660
 and with you was san sanych anton vasilyevich 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.660
 projects then here everyone
