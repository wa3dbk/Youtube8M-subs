00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
point to it but then again I guess the

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.680 
point to it but then again I guess the
whole<00:06:31.220> show<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:31.580> just<00:06:31.940> about<00:06:32.120> asking<00:06:32.300> the

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
whole show is just about asking the

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.810 
whole show is just about asking the
question<00:06:33.080> what's<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:33.380> point<00:06:33.710> to<00:06:34.250> be<00:06:34.370> honest<00:06:34.700> I

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
question what's the point to be honest I

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.040 
question what's the point to be honest I
always<00:06:35.000> thought<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.360> show<00:06:35.570> was<00:06:35.720> kind<00:06:35.930> of

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
always thought the show was kind of

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.570 
always thought the show was kind of
based<00:06:36.170> on<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.530> daydreams<00:06:37.070> and<00:06:37.250> a<00:06:37.370> lot<00:06:37.550> of

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
based on the daydreams and a lot of

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
dreams just far enough to a point where

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.410 
dreams just far enough to a point where
it's<00:07:06.320> over<00:07:06.650> the<00:07:06.770> top<00:07:07.040> but<00:07:07.370> not<00:07:07.520> unrelatable<00:07:08.180> or

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.420 
it's over the top but not unrelatable or

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.390

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
if not fun to watch I also like the fact

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
that the age difference for them is

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.420 
that the age difference for them is
pretty<00:07:12.050> big<00:07:12.350> so<00:07:12.560> you<00:07:12.680> have<00:07:12.860> the<00:07:13.010> overblown

the tiniest of problems seemed like the
most<00:07:23.770> epic<00:07:24.039> of<00:07:24.370> battles<00:07:24.819> and<00:07:25.000> we<00:07:25.389> loved<00:07:25.660> every
