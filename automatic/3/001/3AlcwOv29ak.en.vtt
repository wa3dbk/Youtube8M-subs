run just fine but when you know starting
Windows<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.009> would<00:01:07.130> take<00:01:07.340> forever<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:08.270> even

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.100 
888 hard drive and and I found these
West<00:02:04.789> older<00:02:05.090> Western<00:02:05.390> Digital<00:02:05.539> hard<00:02:05.780> drives

West older Western Digital hard drives

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.859 
West older Western Digital hard drives
to<00:02:06.259> be<00:02:06.410> decent<00:02:07.069> little<00:02:07.310> performers<00:02:07.880> even<00:02:08.119> in

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
to be decent little performers even in

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.920 
to be decent little performers even in
um<00:02:09.020> if<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.009> want<00:02:10.280> me<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.429> build<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.849> cheap<00:02:11.300> when

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
um if you want me to build a cheap when

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.500 
um if you want me to build a cheap when
there's<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.230> throw<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.590> 7<00:02:12.950> computer<00:02:13.510> yeah

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
there's this throw in a 7 computer yeah

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
there's this throw in a 7 computer yeah
enough<00:02:14.750> older<00:02:15.020> parts<00:02:15.380> these<00:02:16.010> hard<00:02:16.250> drives

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
enough older parts these hard drives

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800 
enough older parts these hard drives
worked<00:02:16.700> really<00:02:16.819> well<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.090> mean<00:02:17.239> they<00:02:17.480> score

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
worked really well I mean they score

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.720 
worked really well I mean they score

this computer the stock harddrive as you
can<00:02:31.769> see<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.129> in<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.940> plugged<00:02:33.269> up

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
is a samsung spin point hard drive I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.660 
is a samsung spin point hard drive I
never<00:02:37.230> knew<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.680> hard<00:02:37.920> drives<00:02:38.099> were<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> bit

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
never knew these hard drives were a bit

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.580 
never knew these hard drives were a bit
slow<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.239> made<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> speech<00:02:39.720> configuration<00:02:40.530> I'm

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
slow and made a speech configuration I'm

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.550 
slow and made a speech configuration I'm
not<00:02:40.739> quite<00:02:40.950> sure<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.580> have<00:02:42.390> found<00:02:42.720> out<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:42.989> for

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
not quite sure I have found out that for

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.280 
not quite sure I have found out that for
some<00:02:43.620> reason<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.269> some<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.629> my<00:02:45.690> experiences

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
some reason and some of my experiences

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.949 
some reason and some of my experiences
these<00:02:47.280> Intel<00:02:47.849> manufacturing<00:02:48.450> motherboards

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
these Intel manufacturing motherboards

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
these Intel manufacturing motherboards
and<00:02:49.140> let's<00:02:49.260> say<00:02:49.470> some<00:02:49.829> who<00:02:49.950> taught<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:50.310> hard

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
and let's say some who taught you hard

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.789 
and let's say some who taught you hard
drives<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:51.090> say<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.780> Samsung<00:02:52.260> spin<00:02:52.560> point

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
drives or say the Samsung spin point

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.399 
drives or say the Samsung spin point
hard<00:02:52.980> drive<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:54.450> seemed<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> real<00:02:55.170> slow

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
hard drive it seemed like a real slow

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.190 
hard drive it seemed like a real slow
configuration<00:02:56.629> we<00:02:57.629> have<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> use<00:02:57.989> one<00:02:58.170> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
configuration we have to use one of

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.509 
configuration we have to use one of
those<00:02:58.319> Western<00:02:58.680> Digital<00:02:58.799> hard<00:02:59.069> drives<00:02:59.370> like

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
those Western Digital hard drives like

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.780 
those Western Digital hard drives like
this<00:02:59.579> one<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.599> computer<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.049> be<00:03:01.079> snappy

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
this one the computer would be snappy

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.690 
this one the computer would be snappy
and<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.629> case<00:03:03.810> with<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.140> computer

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
and that was the case with this computer

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.920 
and that was the case with this computer
originally<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.819> took<00:03:06.030> forever<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.629> start

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
originally it took forever to start

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.349 
originally it took forever to start
Windows<00:03:07.290> XP<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.000> was<00:03:09.090> telling<00:03:09.239> you

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
Windows XP and like I was telling you

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.910 
Windows XP and like I was telling you
you<00:03:09.569> would<00:03:09.690> take<00:03:09.840> furlough<00:03:10.290> things<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.680> task

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
you would take furlough things like task

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440 
you would take furlough things like task
manager<00:03:11.310> let's<00:03:11.519> kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:11.819> task<00:03:12.090> managers

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
manager let's kind of like task managers

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.259 
manager let's kind of like task managers
for<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.659> heck<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.579> pulls<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.730> right<00:03:14.760> up<00:03:15.090> no

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
for the heck of it pulls it right up no

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.780 
for the heck of it pulls it right up no
problem<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.989> let's<00:03:19.260> say<00:03:19.379> by<00:03:19.560> now<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.829> only

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
problem and let's say by now the only

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.039 
problem and let's say by now the only
old<00:03:20.909> hard<00:03:21.120> drive<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.629> now<00:03:21.780> pulled

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
old hard drive it will just now pulled

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.960 
old hard drive it will just now pulled
it<00:03:22.170> up<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.099> give<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.430> give<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:23.940> a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it up just to give you give you a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.569 
it up just to give you give you a
comparison<00:03:24.299> but<00:03:25.079> um<00:03:25.230> anyway<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.099> thing<00:03:26.340> has

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
comparison but um anyway this thing has

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.830 
comparison but um anyway this thing has
the<00:03:27.230> speed<00:03:28.230> has<00:03:28.379> increased<00:03:28.890> dramatically<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
the speed has increased dramatically and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.150 
the speed has increased dramatically and
there's<00:03:31.019> another<00:03:31.169> thing<00:03:31.319> I'm<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.980> talk

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
there's another thing I'm going to talk

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.250 
there's another thing I'm going to talk
to<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> about<00:03:32.430> about<00:03:32.609> these<00:03:33.510> Dale<00:03:33.780> computers

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
to you about about these Dale computers

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.409 
to you about about these Dale computers
even<00:03:34.650> newer<00:03:34.829> ones<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.430> cool<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:36.269> feature

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
even newer ones a cool little feature

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.140 
even newer ones a cool little feature
that<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.889> wish<00:03:38.190> many<00:03:38.579> other<00:03:38.760> computers

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
that I wish many other computers

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360 
that I wish many other computers
especially<00:03:39.530> read<00:03:40.530> some<00:03:40.739> other<00:03:40.859> boards<00:03:41.220> for

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
especially read some other boards for

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.550 
especially read some other boards for
custom<00:03:41.639> build<00:03:41.819> machines<00:03:42.180> would<00:03:42.359> have<00:03:42.599> let's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
custom build machines would have let's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.020 
custom build machines would have let's
go<00:03:43.680> ahead<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.889> restruck<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.310> thing

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.340 

seemed<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.750> run<00:03:50.870> pretty<00:03:51.050> fast<00:03:51.320> now<00:03:53.110> like<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.200> say

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
seemed to run pretty fast now like I say

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.500 
seemed to run pretty fast now like I say
this<00:03:54.470> isn't<00:03:54.680> quite<00:03:54.890> clean<00:03:55.340> still<00:03:55.670> has<00:03:55.940> plenty

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
this isn't quite clean still has plenty

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150 
this isn't quite clean still has plenty
of<00:03:56.630> programs<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.230> stuff<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.740> so<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.010> does

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
of programs and stuff on it so it does

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.120 
of programs and stuff on it so it does
have<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.340> pretty<00:03:58.640> good<00:03:58.730> bit<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.560> stuff<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.770> shut

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
have a pretty good bit of stuff to shut

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.000 
have a pretty good bit of stuff to shut

let's say if you have an older Dale like

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.640 
let's say if you have an older Dale like
this<00:04:21.549> one<00:04:21.730> for<00:04:22.540> example<00:04:22.630> when<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.139> see<00:04:23.380> that

it's<00:05:19.690> seeking<00:05:20.080> for<00:05:20.440> files<00:05:20.680> but<00:05:21.130> at<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.850> same

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
it's seeking for files but at the same

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.779 
it's seeking for files but at the same
time<00:05:22.770> it's<00:05:23.770> running<00:05:24.010> faster<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.580> it's

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
time it's running faster and it's

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.150 
time it's running faster and it's
actually<00:05:25.090> able<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.479> load<00:05:26.410> things<00:05:26.590> faster<00:05:27.130> and

actually able to load things faster and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.700 
actually able to load things faster and
you'll<00:05:27.430> notice<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:27.940> actually<00:05:28.590> so<00:05:29.590> that's

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
you'll notice it actually so that's

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.320 
you'll notice it actually so that's
another<00:05:29.890> thing<00:05:30.039> i<00:05:30.130> recommend<00:05:30.250> if<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.180> have<00:05:31.300> a

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
another thing i recommend if you have a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.960 
another thing i recommend if you have a
dell<00:05:31.570> machine<00:05:31.960> even<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:33.100> newer<00:05:33.280> one<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.910> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
dell machine even a newer one like I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.460 
dell machine even a newer one like I
said<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.210> newer<00:05:34.360> ones<00:05:34.630> had<00:05:34.810> this<00:05:34.930> option<00:05:35.320> too

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
said the newer ones had this option too

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.770 
said the newer ones had this option too
and<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.560> course<00:05:38.800> if<00:05:39.789> you<00:05:40.000> have<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.360> want<00:05:40.600> your

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
and of course if you have to want your

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.529 
and of course if you have to want your
hard<00:05:40.960> drive<00:05:41.140> to<00:05:41.169> be<00:05:41.260> quiet<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:43.030> can<00:05:43.180> set<00:05:43.389> to

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
hard drive to be quiet you can set to

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.360 
hard drive to be quiet you can set to
quiet<00:05:43.810> but<00:05:44.110> you'll<00:05:44.260> have<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.590> performance

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
quiet but you'll have a performance

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.850 
quiet but you'll have a performance
impact<00:05:45.820> not<00:05:46.570> that<00:05:46.810> much<00:05:47.020> for<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.380> will<00:05:47.560> notice

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
impact not that much for you will notice

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.909 
impact not that much for you will notice
an<00:05:47.979> impact<00:05:48.310> in<00:05:49.350> probably<00:05:50.350> like<00:05:50.410> your<00:05:50.560> startup

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
an impact in probably like your startup

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.830 
an impact in probably like your startup
