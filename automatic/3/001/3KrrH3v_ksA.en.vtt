00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that's no good so what we're going to do

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.240 
that's no good so what we're going to do
is<00:00:58.949> let<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.699> boil<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.719> cook<00:01:01.250> for

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is let these actually boil and cook for

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
is let these actually boil and cook for
20<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> 30<00:01:02.879> minutes<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.300> depends<00:01:03.539> upon<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
20 to 30 minutes it depends upon the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.660 
20 to 30 minutes it depends upon the
size<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.369> your<00:01:05.430> sweet<00:01:06.060> potato<00:01:06.330> chunks<00:01:07.670> perfect

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
I'm going to put the lid back on but be
careful<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:10.979> obviously<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.540> water

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
careful because obviously now your water

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
careful because obviously now your water
will<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.260> higher<00:01:13.409> than<00:01:13.439> before<00:01:13.770> because

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
will be a bit higher than before because

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
will be a bit higher than before because
you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> potatoes<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
you have all the potatoes in there and
the<00:01:16.320> boiling<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.430> make<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.210> bigger

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the boiling will you know make it bigger

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910
