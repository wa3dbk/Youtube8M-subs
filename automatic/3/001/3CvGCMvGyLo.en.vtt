00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.240
 good today I will do here this review 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.630
 Captain America here that he is with a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.059
 uniform of the first film, which was 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.359
 captain america the first avenger and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.630
 also this uniform he appeared there in the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.340
 second film that is captain america or 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 winter soldier, right? 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.220
 Good thing this figure is here, I do not even 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.679
 giving a researched about it and type I 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.680
 I realized that this figure here is 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.040
 only a re-launch, that is to say 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.629
 here it had already been released in the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 seat of the captain's first film 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.210
 America and now it's relaunched 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.690
 is as well a better painting by the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.309
 that I realized and she also does not come 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.860
 with accessory that I think 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.620
 formerly the figure of the captain came 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 with an extra weapon that I think is a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 rifle and now he only comes with that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 my're here so that's there 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 good is to enjoy this figure because it is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.950
 well detailed she has a painting 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 excellent indeed and expensive 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 She has this bag here. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.799
 Captain, she comes with this pocket here and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.950
 these deals are what they do with 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.010
 that the captain can secure without the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.440
