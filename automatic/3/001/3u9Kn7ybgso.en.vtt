00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
first series of where the characters all

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.540 
first series of where the characters all
came<00:05:33.690> together<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:34.560> want<00:05:35.070> you<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.220> think<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.490> the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
came together I want you to think of the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.070 
came together I want you to think of the
guardians<00:05:35.850> of<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.000> galaxy<00:05:36.390> essentially<00:05:36.930> as

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
guardians of the galaxy essentially as

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.790 
guardians of the galaxy essentially as
the<00:05:37.590> Avengers<00:05:38.340> except<00:05:39.300> on<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:40.200> other<00:05:40.410> side<00:05:40.740> of

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
the Avengers except on the other side of

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.800 
the Avengers except on the other side of
the<00:05:40.890> galaxy<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.520> eventually<00:05:42.000> in<00:05:42.180> other<00:05:42.450> comic

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
the galaxy and eventually in other comic

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.360 
the galaxy and eventually in other comic
book<00:05:42.960> arcs<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.380> think<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.560> was<00:05:43.650> in<00:05:43.740> 2006

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
book arcs I think it was in 2006

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.120 
book arcs I think it was in 2006
annihilation<00:05:45.330> or<00:05:45.450> 2008<00:05:46.170> there<00:05:46.800> was<00:05:46.920> another

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
annihilation or 2008 there was another

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.890 
annihilation or 2008 there was another
guardians<00:05:47.610> of<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.730> galaxy<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.210> series<00:05:48.870> that

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
guardians of the galaxy a series that

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.840 
guardians of the galaxy a series that
started<00:05:49.350> up<00:05:49.470> which<00:05:49.710> took<00:05:50.220> on<00:05:50.340> I<00:05:50.400> think<00:05:50.670> believe

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
started up which took on I think believe

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.790 
started up which took on I think believe
it<00:05:50.940> was<00:05:51.060> Ultron<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:51.990> on<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.230> so<00:05:52.380> forth

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
it was Ultron and so on and so forth

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.200 
it was Ultron and so on and so forth
