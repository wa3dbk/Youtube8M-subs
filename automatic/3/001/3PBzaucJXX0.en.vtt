zombies to build up behind them and
especially<00:00:59.340> without<00:00:59.699> jokin<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.300> gets<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
especially without jokin all gets it's a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.630 
especially without jokin all gets it's a
to<00:01:01.170> hit<00:01:01.410> kill<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> mean<00:01:01.949> zombies<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.399> easily

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to hit kill I mean zombies can easily

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.109 
to hit kill I mean zombies can easily
just<00:01:02.820> DoubleTap<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.890> did

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
just DoubleTap you and that's it you did

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
just DoubleTap you and that's it you did
just<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.360> hits<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
just two hits right like that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.960 
just two hits right like that
okay<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.210> second<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.229> second<00:01:10.619> tip<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.640> go

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
okay the second the second tip is to go

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.219 
okay the second the second tip is to go
for<00:01:12.330> headshots

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for headshots

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
now headshots are really useful because

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
now headshots are really useful because
they<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.909> hard

situation as you can see just there I

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
situation as you can see just there I
didn't<00:01:20.909> didn't<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> headshot<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.920> took

firing into their heads especially on
round<00:01:35.909> zoning<00:01:36.600> around<00:01:36.780> 5<00:01:36.990> now<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:39.360> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
round zoning around 5 now so go for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.940 
round zoning around 5 now so go for
headshots<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.020> cannot<00:01:40.229> even<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
headshots you cannot even get you out of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260

corners<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> especially<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.150> you're

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
corners if you especially if you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.260 
corners if you especially if you're
trapped<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> corner<00:01:43.909> headshots<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
trapped in a corner headshots is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.100 
trapped in a corner headshots is
definitely<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> go

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
definitely the way to go

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.880 
definitely the way to go
so<00:01:49.549> yeah<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.720> headshots<00:01:51.890> ok

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so yeah just just go for headshots ok

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.030 
so yeah just just go for headshots ok
now<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> next<00:01:53.880> thing<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> never<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
now the next thing is to never go in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.910 
now the next thing is to never go in
corners<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.469> corners

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
corners like this if you go in corners

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.539 
corners like this if you go in corners
then<00:01:59.610> zombies<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.390> always<00:02:01.040> can't<00:02:02.040> surround
