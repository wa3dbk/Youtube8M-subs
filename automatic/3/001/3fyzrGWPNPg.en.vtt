00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello to all today we will see 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.099
 how to do internships 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.420
 these are traditional donuts 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.620
 Moroccans that are also found in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.940
 other countries of the maghreb 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 so in the robot bowl I put the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 yeast 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 there I used the dry feed but we 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.960
 can very well use an airplane 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.679
 baker preaches I received and I'm going 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 put some lukewarm water to make 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 dissolve the sugar Allure 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.100
 this operation is important what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.520
 whatever yeast for you use 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.520
 dry or fresh to activate yeast 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.399
 I add the flour the salt 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.219
 I start to add lukewarm water 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.600
 gradually kneading the dough 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.629
 thing you can do is go 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.369
 of a robot or by hand so we see 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 to work the dough well this is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 important for donuts to be s 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.549
 like it be well done and praising the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.549
 play as you go 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.980
 in the end the dough must have a texture 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.820
 very sticky and when you lift it 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.130
 does it mean that the dough 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.290
 is ready 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.920
 so as you see on the video it's 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.130
 the texture caen wants to get 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 so after that we'll cover it 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.820
 let it rise for a minimum 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.290
 three hours you can even leave 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.330
 a whole night if we prepare you and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.420
 delphine relief the next morning by 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.420
 example 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.600
 so here we see the leg that has risen well 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.820
 meanwhile I heated oil bath 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.890
 I release a little impact and I start 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.710
 to make the donuts and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.660
 dive directly into oil for 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.550
 avoid dough sticking to fingers 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.680
 I hand transmit in water and I 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.250
 take a type of dough it is to do 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250
 a hole in the middle 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.460
 do not hesitate to stretch the hole for 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860
 expand it otherwise it will be done once 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.180
 in cabbages 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.490
 I must admit that this is the most 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.620
 difficult the recipe the same if the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 shape is not perfect it's not 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.650
 serious the bottom line is that the donuts 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.930
 be well lightly ventilated inside crous 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.550
 shot from the outside and that's guaranteed 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.350
 when we work and at the end of this 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.770
 share in the leash the berries of time 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.770
 that need 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.350
 they are paid on both sides for 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.540
 let him take golden bernard then out of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.720
 effects taste on paper towels 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.730
 before serving them hot 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.030
 sprinkled on it or dipped in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.300
 honey 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.490
 Believe me it's a real treat I hope 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.020
 that recipe you liked at audi 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.020
 for appetite is the next
