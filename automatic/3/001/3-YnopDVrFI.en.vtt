these are being stars in October the
next<00:01:08.550> board<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.570> our<00:01:10.290> split<00:01:10.620> it's<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> return

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
next board is our split it's the return

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
this is a directional twin splitboard so

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.670 
this is a directional twin splitboard so
it's<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.810> little<00:01:18.020> different<00:01:18.170> than<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.469> lot<00:01:18.619> of

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
you get some equipment on the split

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.749 
you get some equipment on the split
board<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.649> becomes<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.069> little<00:01:46.100> bit<00:01:46.399> cumbersome
