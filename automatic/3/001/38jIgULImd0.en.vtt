yeah<00:00:13.049> we're<00:00:13.530> setting<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:13.919> up<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.219> an<00:00:14.339> intense

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
yeah we're setting this up on an intense

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.359 
yeah we're setting this up on an intense
today<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.629> intense<00:00:15.929> actually<00:00:16.169> has<00:00:16.500> cable

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
today and the intense actually has cable

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
today and the intense actually has cable
routing<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:17.849> on<00:00:17.939> the<00:00:18.029> top<00:00:18.240> tube<00:00:18.509> one<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
routing here on the top tube one of the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.109 
routing here on the top tube one of the
cool<00:00:19.590> features<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> lab<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
cool features of the lab is that the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
cool features of the lab is that the
cable<00:00:21.449> doesn't<00:00:21.630> actually<00:00:21.960> move<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.400> once

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
cable doesn't actually move so once

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
cable doesn't actually move so once
that's<00:00:23.820> set<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.929> have<00:00:25.050> any<00:00:25.199> cable

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that's set up you don't have any cable

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
that's set up you don't have any cable
growth<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.160> get<00:00:26.279> down<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:27.000> your

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
growth that's going to get down in your

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.380 
growth that's going to get down in your
tire<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.349> linkage<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:28.859> cause<00:00:28.980> problems

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
tire or your linkage and cause problems

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
tire or your linkage and cause problems
especially<00:00:30.390> cool<00:00:30.509> on<00:00:30.750> twenty<00:00:31.050> nine<00:00:31.170> hours

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
especially cool on twenty nine hours

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
especially cool on twenty nine hours
like<00:00:31.589> this<00:00:31.740> bike<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.759> tire<00:00:33.000> being<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
like this bike here that tire being up a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.640 
like this bike here that tire being up a
little<00:00:33.600> higher<00:00:33.780> gives<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.199> a<00:00:34.260> lot<00:00:34.470> less

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
little higher gives you a lot less

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.560 
little higher gives you a lot less
clearance<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.400> so<00:00:35.879> with<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.120> ki<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.449> being

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
clearance and so with that ki will being

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.820 
clearance and so with that ki will being
in<00:00:36.780> tight<00:00:37.019> you're<00:00:37.229> not<00:00:37.350> gonna<00:00:37.470> have<00:00:37.650> any

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
in tight you're not gonna have any

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.700 
in tight you're not gonna have any
interference<00:00:38.339> issues<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.600> simply<00:00:40.019> set

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
interference issues there you simply set

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.000 
interference issues there you simply set
this<00:00:41.900> cable<00:00:42.900> stop<00:00:43.080> wherever<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.769> it'll

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this cable stop wherever you want it'll

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.219 
this cable stop wherever you want it'll
rotate<00:00:44.159> anywhere<00:00:44.670> within<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.150> 360<00:00:45.930> degrees

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
rotate anywhere within the 360 degrees

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.170 
rotate anywhere within the 360 degrees
we're<00:00:46.949> gonna<00:00:47.040> choose<00:00:47.369> the<00:00:47.549> side<00:00:47.790> because

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we're gonna choose the side because

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.460 
we're gonna choose the side because
that's<00:00:48.330> gonna<00:00:48.479> match<00:00:48.720> real<00:00:48.989> nice<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
that's gonna match real nice with the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.520 
that's gonna match real nice with the
routing<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.830> this<00:00:50.010> frame<00:00:51.170> we'll<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.290> that<00:00:52.409> in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
routing on this frame we'll get that in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.250 
routing on this frame we'll get that in
place<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.949> clamp<00:00:53.159> it<00:00:53.960> now<00:00:54.960> we've<00:00:55.110> already

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
place and clamp it now we've already

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.710 
place and clamp it now we've already
removed<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.890> head<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.850> remove<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
removed the head here just remove the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.899 
removed the head here just remove the
two<00:00:57.869> bolts<00:00:58.049> this<00:00:58.860> will<00:00:59.040> drop<00:00:59.220> down<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
two bolts this will drop down and

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.270 
two bolts this will drop down and
there's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.269> cradle<00:01:00.659> at<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.869> top<00:01:01.080> here<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
there's a cradle at the top here with a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.530 
there's a cradle at the top here with a
flat<00:01:02.519> screwdriver<00:01:03.330> pull<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> cap<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.540> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
flat screwdriver pull the cap out and so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.499 
flat screwdriver pull the cap out and so
this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> indexed<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.759> way<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> works<00:01:09.299> is

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
this is indexed and so way this works is

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.749 
this is indexed and so way this works is
it<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.750> rotate<00:01:09.929> anywhere<00:01:10.469> within<00:01:10.679> that<00:01:10.799> 360

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
it will rotate anywhere within that 360

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.200 
it will rotate anywhere within that 360
degrees<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.469> stop<00:01:13.469> in<00:01:13.679> a<00:01:13.770> detent<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.090> we'll

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
degrees and stop in a detent and we'll

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
degrees and stop in a detent and we'll
go<00:01:15.329> ahead<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.020> cap<00:01:16.469> back<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:16.859> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
go ahead and put this cap back in and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
go ahead and put this cap back in and
that<00:01:17.399> locks<00:01:17.640> everything<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:20.609> post

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
