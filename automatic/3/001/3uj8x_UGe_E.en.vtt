 the state the cleanliness and the operation 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 front lights so we put the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.160
 contact position lights and traffic lights 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 crossing is starting 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 then the high beams and finally 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.380
 the lighthouse call so the contact was 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:41.190
 the opposition low beam fires 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 road and lighthouse call us 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.100
 can at the same time check on the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.100

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.770
 right then left as well as the fires of 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 distress by checking the witness's 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.869
 reminder on the dashboard 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.320
 we will first check and at the 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.159
 cleanliness at the front and back of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.650
 blinkers then turn them on 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.580
 so at the back it works at the front 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.580
 also and right same thing up front 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.600

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 we will check the state poverty 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 of fire the back opposition of the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 reflective lighting device 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.550
 of plates as well as the plate 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 mineralogical 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.640
 we make the contact the fact 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.660
 the opposition works the lighting of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.660
 plates also the end of this top 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.220
 we will check once the contact 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.710
 but that the bottom of this top works 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.009
 with the rear brake this is the case then 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.140
 the brake before all the safety hand 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.450
 1 in the mud all we will check 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.610
 that a horn works but also the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.510
 presence of the two mirrors they 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.410
 be clean in good condition and well regulated 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.810
 and the pilot's safety hands 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.739
 so this is the helmet we have to 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
 check his condition 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.110
 the cleanliness of the screen we give 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.160
 so check that it has the standard e 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.799
 or nf then we will put it on 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.100
 check that it is our size the 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.080
 lock and see if they bother us 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.530
