said I'll give you a great example here

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.780 
said I'll give you a great example here
of<00:02:20.600> exactly<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.640> go

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
of exactly what not to do there we go

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.420 
of exactly what not to do there we go
that's<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.090> poorly<00:02:26.420> placed<00:02:26.660> shot<00:02:27.280> should<00:02:28.280> have

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
that's a poorly placed shot should have

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.970 
that's a poorly placed shot should have
gone<00:02:28.490> for<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> hatch<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.650> not<00:02:30.650> really<00:02:30.890> so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
gone for the hatch but not really so

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.040 
gone for the hatch but not really so
familiar<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.910> tank<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.510> thought<00:02:33.020> I

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
familiar with that tank and thought I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.050 
familiar with that tank and thought I
might<00:02:33.350> be<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> writer

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
might be a writer

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.130 
might be a writer
shooting<00:02:35.060> kind<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.360> into<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.630> turret<00:02:35.959> where<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
shooting kind of into the turret where I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.380 
shooting kind of into the turret where I
was<00:02:36.320> there<00:02:36.560> she<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.580> hindsight<00:02:37.910> was<00:02:38.150> pretty

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
was there she in hindsight was pretty

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.210 
was there she in hindsight was pretty
stupid<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:38.990> there<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.200> go

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.440 

so<00:02:43.220> still<00:02:43.490> pretty<00:02:43.640> even<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> scores<00:02:44.360> at

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
so still pretty even on the scores at

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.030 
so still pretty even on the scores at
the<00:02:44.480> moment<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.020> go<00:02:45.170> Lewis<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.650> got<00:02:45.800> kill

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the moment you go Lewis just got kill

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.990 
the moment you go Lewis just got kill

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
is 1153 massive damage on the BK I think

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.240 
is 1153 massive damage on the BK I think
he<00:02:59.300> he<00:03:00.050> must<00:03:00.290> have<00:03:00.440> assumed<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.890> was<00:03:01.010> an<00:03:01.130> idiot

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
he he must have assumed I was an idiot

for for bouncing that first shot and

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.350 
for for bouncing that first shot and
then<00:03:03.920> got<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> bit<00:03:04.370> overconfident<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.150> just

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
then got a bit overconfident and just

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.420 
then got a bit overconfident and just
sat<00:03:05.540> there<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.810> aimed<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.590> shot<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
sat there and aimed that shot I'm on the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
more damage in this tank is that this

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.670 
more damage in this tank is that this
and<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.330> death<00:03:15.049> start

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
and the the death start

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.650 
and the the death start
I<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:16.190> people<00:03:16.760> see<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.180> they<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.450> run

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
I just people see it and they just run

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.270 
I just people see it and they just run

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
what the damage you can do so they're a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.530 
what the damage you can do so they're a
lot<00:03:20.720> more<00:03:20.750> cautious<00:03:21.110> but<00:03:21.560> not<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.180> much<00:03:23.299> in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
lot more cautious but not so much in

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.649 
lot more cautious but not so much in

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the flank here first little bit of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.470 
the flank here first little bit of
damage<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.950> take<00:03:40.129> there<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.599> gum<00:03:41.750> repaired

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
don't know what happened to that strike

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.830 
don't know what happened to that strike
guess<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.370> bounced<00:03:46.849> or<00:03:47.000> maybe<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.450> went<00:03:47.629> wide

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
guess that bounced or maybe it went wide

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110 
guess that bounced or maybe it went wide
but<00:03:48.230> really<00:03:49.220> felt<00:03:49.459> like<00:03:49.549> that<00:03:49.670> should<00:03:50.000> have

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
but really felt like that should have

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.289 
but really felt like that should have
been<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.269> damaging<00:03:51.109> shot<00:03:51.819> it's<00:03:52.819> got<00:03:52.970> me<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.150> the
