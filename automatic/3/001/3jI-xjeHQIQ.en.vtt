00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
there I don't really like that rather

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.680 
there I don't really like that rather
have<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.230> stay<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.650> place<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:46.090> it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
have it stay in place but if it it

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.300 
have it stay in place but if it it
probably<00:03:46.989> didn't<00:03:47.650> probably<00:03:47.950> made<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.190> like

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
probably didn't probably made it like

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.280 
probably didn't probably made it like
that<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.880> makes<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.450> articulation<00:03:50.139> move

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
that so it makes the articulation move

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.250 
that so it makes the articulation move
better<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:51.099> prefer<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.940> she<00:03:52.150> also<00:03:53.019> comes

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.370 
like about those figures as you can see
she<00:04:14.909> doesn't<00:04:14.939> want<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.359> stand<00:04:15.659> up<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.989> wall<00:04:16.199> I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
she doesn't want to stand up that wall I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.830 
she doesn't want to stand up that wall I
mean<00:04:16.560> she's<00:04:16.769> very<00:04:16.979> flimsy<00:04:17.479> wants<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.600> fall

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
mean she's very flimsy wants to fall

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.409 
mean she's very flimsy wants to fall
over<00:04:18.870> really<00:04:19.380> easily<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.009> that's<00:04:21.000> why<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.180> used

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
over really easily so that's why I used

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.409 
over really easily so that's why I used
to<00:04:21.570> stand<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.049> here<00:04:22.259> so<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.970> don't

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
to stand on here so you know I don't

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.020 
to stand on here so you know I don't
really<00:04:24.600> like<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.380> other<00:04:26.370> thing<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:26.820> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
really like that one other thing that a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.790 
really like that one other thing that a
lot<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.419> people<00:04:27.509> are<00:04:27.780> hating<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.199> our<00:04:28.380> intent

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
lot of people are hating is our intent

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.920 
lot of people are hating is our intent
as<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.490> can<00:04:29.639> see<00:04:29.820> right<00:04:29.850> here<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.449> looks<00:04:30.660> thin

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
as you can see right here it looks thin

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.200 
as you can see right here it looks thin
but<00:04:31.650> if<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.830> move<00:04:32.009> her<00:04:32.160> off<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.490> side<00:04:32.729> it

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
but if you move her off to the side it

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.080 
but if you move her off to the side it
gets<00:04:33.630> even<00:04:33.780> bigger<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:35.220> think<00:04:35.759> they<00:04:35.880> did<00:04:36.060> that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
gets even bigger I think they did that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.300 
gets even bigger I think they did that
for<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.479> safety<00:04:36.960> feature<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:37.949> doesn't<00:04:38.130> like

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
for a safety feature so it doesn't like

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.659 
for a safety feature so it doesn't like
snap<00:04:38.639> off<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.090> anything<00:04:39.830> no<00:04:40.830> looks<00:04:41.130> okay<00:04:41.639> from

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
snap off or anything no looks okay from

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.580 
snap off or anything no looks okay from
the<00:04:42.060> front<00:04:42.389> but<00:04:42.780> when<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.020> get<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.259> off<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the front but when you get it off to the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.760 
the front but when you get it off to the
side<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:45.050> rectangular<00:04:46.050> giant

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
side it's just this rectangular giant

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.339 
side it's just this rectangular giant
thing<00:04:46.949> sticking<00:04:47.340> out<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.699> her<00:04:47.789> head<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.349> really

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
thing sticking out of her head I really

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.290 
thing sticking out of her head I really
hate<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:50.039> mean<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> lot<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.910> people<00:04:51.030> are

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
hate that I mean a lot of people are

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.480 
hate that I mean a lot of people are
considering<00:04:51.840> cutting<00:04:52.080> an<00:04:52.289> offer<00:04:52.500> head<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.039> mean

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
considering cutting an offer head I mean

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.060 
considering cutting an offer head I mean
I<00:04:53.520> might<00:04:53.880> consider<00:04:54.270> doing<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.599> too<00:04:54.979> but<00:04:55.979> it

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
I might consider doing that too but it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.339 
I might consider doing that too but it
looks<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.639> can<00:04:56.880> remove<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.539> it<00:04:57.840> might<00:04:58.199> be

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
looks like you can remove it it might be

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.200 
looks like you can remove it it might be
just<00:04:58.380> like<00:04:58.830> stuck<00:04:59.130> under<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> figure<00:04:59.759> but<00:04:59.970> I
