but that's ridiculous

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
but that's ridiculous
if<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> cut<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> goal<00:00:40.410> from<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
if we do have to cut the goal from the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
if we do have to cut the goal from the
last<00:00:41.100> corner<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.700> would<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> one
