00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
off because the compass is a little

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.630 
off because the compass is a little
goofy<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.729> bounces<00:01:02.269> around<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.690> little<00:01:03.640> and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
goofy and it bounces around a little and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.370 
goofy and it bounces around a little and
all<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:05.659> know<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.020> know<00:01:06.170> which

all that so you know I know which
direction<00:01:06.560> I'm<00:01:06.860> going<00:01:07.070> anyway<00:01:07.370> here<00:01:07.640> because

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
direction I'm going anyway here because

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.859 
direction I'm going anyway here because
the<00:01:08.000> truck<00:01:08.630> has<00:01:08.810> one<00:01:09.049> built<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.750> don't<00:01:11.750> look

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
the truck has one built in so don't look

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.480 
the truck has one built in so don't look
at<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.049> often<00:01:12.440> enough<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.680> really<00:01:13.010> need<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.369> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
at it often enough to really need it on

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
otherwise it works really good like just

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.730 
otherwise it works really good like just
kind<00:01:23.150> of<00:01:23.180> hold<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.480> close<00:01:23.720> up<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.140> can<00:01:24.320> see<00:01:24.530> how

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because the screen is bigger so it makes

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.710 
because the screen is bigger so it makes
stuff<00:02:02.700> easier<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> read<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
stuff easier to read you can see as I

engines<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.709> know<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:24.950> ain't<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.189> big<00:02:25.370> one

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
engines you know it ain't the big one

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.399 
engines you know it ain't the big one
but<00:02:25.849> it's<00:02:26.090> definitely<00:02:26.540> got<00:02:26.900> enough<00:02:27.109> torque

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
but it's definitely got enough torque

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.830 
but it's definitely got enough torque
for<00:02:27.739> me<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.450> don't<00:02:29.510> hate<00:02:29.810> too<00:02:30.019> much

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.290 

every<00:02:33.500> everyday<00:02:33.950> driver<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.640> me<00:02:34.760> basically

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
every everyday driver for me basically

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.760 
every everyday driver for me basically
so<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.690> don't<00:02:35.930> need<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.080> whole<00:02:36.230> lot<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.440> power<00:02:37.510> but

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
so I don't need a whole lot of power but

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.370 
so I don't need a whole lot of power but

try that function yet but I just you
know<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.770> seen<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.550> description<00:03:21.390> on

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
the app that it had that on it so I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.850

suppose<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.530> know

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
suppose you know

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.070 
suppose you know
if<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.490> was<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.790> try<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> would<00:03:27.780> know<00:03:27.930> it's

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
if I was to try it I would know it's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.690 
if I was to try it I would know it's
like<00:03:28.320> but<00:03:28.620> since<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:28.950> haven't<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.370> can't<00:03:29.400> really
