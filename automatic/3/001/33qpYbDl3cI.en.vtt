also new to the organization so she

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.280

meetings<00:00:54.879> over<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.270> course<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.809> few<00:00:56.020> weeks

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
meetings over the course of a few weeks

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.860 
meetings over the course of a few weeks
to<00:00:56.559> bring<00:00:56.710> her<00:00:56.800> up<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:56.950> speed<00:00:57.100> our<00:00:58.090> first<00:00:58.480> few

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
to bring her up to speed our first few

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.720 
to bring her up to speed our first few
interactions<00:00:59.530> I<00:01:00.010> thought<00:01:00.190> were<00:01:00.340> somewhat

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
interactions I thought were somewhat

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.299 
interactions I thought were somewhat
negative<00:01:01.210> she<00:01:02.110> was<00:01:02.289> very<00:01:02.710> short<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.219> her

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
negative she was very short in her

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.859 
negative she was very short in her
responses<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.059> me<00:01:04.180> when<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.420> would<00:01:04.570> ask<00:01:04.600> her

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
responses to me when I would ask her

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.080 
responses to me when I would ask her
questions<00:01:05.259> or<00:01:05.440> provider<00:01:05.740> information<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.670> I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
questions or provider information and I

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.090 
questions or provider information and I
thought<00:01:07.330> her<00:01:07.660> speech<00:01:08.170> was<00:01:08.320> very<00:01:08.380> harsh<00:01:08.860> and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
thought her speech was very harsh and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.370 
thought her speech was very harsh and
tone<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.550> originally<00:01:10.360> sort<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.840> brushed<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.259> off

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
tone I originally sort of brushed it off

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380 
tone I originally sort of brushed it off
and<00:01:11.619> thought<00:01:11.800> maybe<00:01:12.580> she<00:01:12.820> was<00:01:12.910> just<00:01:13.060> having<00:01:13.330> a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
and thought maybe she was just having a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.670 
and thought maybe she was just having a
bad<00:01:13.539> day<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> didn't<00:01:14.380> think<00:01:14.530> too<00:01:14.649> much

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
bad day and I didn't think too much

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.950 
bad day and I didn't think too much
about<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.220> but<00:01:15.759> as<00:01:15.880> we<00:01:16.030> continue<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.479> me<00:01:16.720> I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
about it but as we continue to me I

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.300 
about it but as we continue to me I
thought<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.289> interactions<00:01:17.770> became<00:01:18.039> more

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
thought the interactions became more

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.620 
thought the interactions became more
negative<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.030> started<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.479> feel

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
negative and I started to feel

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.960 
negative and I started to feel
uncomfortable<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:20.649> would<00:01:21.190> say<00:01:21.340> hello<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.700> her

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
uncomfortable I would say hello to her

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.850 
uncomfortable I would say hello to her
ask<00:01:22.270> her<00:01:22.420> how<00:01:22.539> she<00:01:22.600> was<00:01:22.750> she<00:01:23.530> would<00:01:23.649> just

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
ask her how she was she would just

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.520 
ask her how she was she would just
ignore<00:01:24.009> me<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:24.880> really<00:01:25.270> rude<00:01:25.509> at<00:01:26.380> this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
ignore me and was really rude at this

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.010 
ignore me and was really rude at this
point<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.950> thought<00:01:27.160> these<00:01:28.149> think<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.720> isn't

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
point I thought these think this isn't

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.480 
point I thought these think this isn't
going<00:01:29.229> well<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.679> I<00:01:29.740> was<00:01:29.860> really<00:01:30.069> worried<00:01:30.459> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
going well and I was really worried that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.980 
going well and I was really worried that
she<00:01:30.940> wasn't<00:01:31.090> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.450> trained<00:01:31.750> well

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
she wasn't going to be trained well

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.380 
she wasn't going to be trained well
enough<00:01:32.110> for<00:01:32.770> when<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:32.920> left<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.580> thought<00:01:34.240> about

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
enough for when I left I thought about

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.270 
enough for when I left I thought about
it<00:01:34.599> for<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.780> few<00:01:34.869> days<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.649> knew<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:35.830> needed<00:01:36.009> to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
it for a few days and I knew I needed to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.620 
it for a few days and I knew I needed to
do<00:01:36.399> something<00:01:36.849> but<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.119> wasn't<00:01:37.450> sure<00:01:37.599> that

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
do something but I wasn't sure that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.389 
do something but I wasn't sure that
going<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.110> my<00:01:38.200> supervisor<00:01:38.709> was<00:01:39.039> really<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
going to my supervisor was really the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.219 
going to my supervisor was really the
best<00:01:39.550> course<00:01:39.819> of<00:01:39.910> action<00:01:40.330> because<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.990> didn't

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
best course of action because I didn't

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.449 
best course of action because I didn't
want<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.410> blow<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.740> situation<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.369> of

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
want to blow the situation out of

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.130 
want to blow the situation out of
proportion<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.450> certainly<00:01:43.780> did<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.020> want

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
proportion and I certainly did not want

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.380 
proportion and I certainly did not want
to<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:44.470> her<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.740> trouble<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.220> decided<00:01:46.149> I<00:01:46.330> would

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to get her in trouble I decided I would

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.059 
to get her in trouble I decided I would
speak<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.690> her<00:01:46.869> privately<00:01:47.289> about<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:47.920> let

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
speak to her privately about it and let

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.339 
speak to her privately about it and let
her<00:01:48.190> know<00:01:48.220> how<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> was<00:01:49.030> feeling<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.660> try<00:01:50.289> to

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
her know how I was feeling and try to

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.600 
her know how I was feeling and try to
understand<00:01:50.800> what<00:01:50.920> she<00:01:51.069> was<00:01:51.220> thinking<00:01:51.369> and
