00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:22.950
 We are 2,000 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.550
 is this 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.550
 i good 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.070
 so that they did not go beyond God 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.370
 basically we started to match and when 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.150
 kill us 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 but in this case why not 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.550
 explaining the fires 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.960
 already carries seven casualties I think the first 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 departure of the trip 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 and also new punished 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.170
 do not 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.170
 called 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.720
 Well basically when not and good 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.850
 I started climbing up a lot 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:49.050
 time this same channel a lot of time 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:49.050
 when we had everything you do 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.600
 let's go the reluctance magnitude 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 there is a low of 6 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 Y 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.810
 they have a 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.520
 well look better get out of white 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.880
 we go 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.540
 teeth 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 we are not together 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.060
 this plant zero 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.060
 yes 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.670
 it's possible 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.469
 or good 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.360
 says the norm 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.510
 nothing more no problem whether that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.510
 we have 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:55.160
 very close I'll see if I can leave it 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.160
 that we were leaving in the next video 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.260
 Y 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.349
