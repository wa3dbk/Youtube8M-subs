00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
put something like that in this game and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.490 
put something like that in this game and
feel<00:00:51.149> better<00:00:51.329> knowing<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.230> even

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
feel better knowing that it's not even

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
feel better knowing that it's not even
remotely<00:00:52.770> close<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.460> overpowered<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
remotely close to as overpowered as that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.850 
remotely close to as overpowered as that
is<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.680> cool

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
is and it's actually really really cool

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.290 
is and it's actually really really cool
it's<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> most<00:00:56.340> dangerous<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.090> any

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it's not the most dangerous one by any

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's not the most dangerous one by any
means<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.530> badass<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.730> what<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
means but it is very badass and what I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
means but it is very badass and what I
love<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> its<00:01:01.890> function

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
love so much about it is its function

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
love so much about it is its function
now<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.120> seems<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> generally<00:01:04.140> only

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
now it seems like I can generally only

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
now it seems like I can generally only
get<00:01:04.470> around<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.830> average<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> two<00:01:05.250> kills<00:01:05.640> per

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
get around an average of two kills per

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250 
get around an average of two kills per
each<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.360> i<00:01:06.510> activate<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> special

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
each time i activate the special

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
each time i activate the special
stability<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.250> compared<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.090> things

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
stability which compared to other things

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
stability which compared to other things
like<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.570> sparrows<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.560> tempest<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
like your sparrows and your tempest and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
like your sparrows and your tempest and
you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.090> stuff<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.990> scythe

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you know your stuff like that the scythe

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
you know your stuff like that the scythe
you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.890> easily<00:01:14.070> stack<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.700> four<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.210> six

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you can easily stack up four to six

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
you can easily stack up four to six
kills<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.990> each<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> those<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.220> one

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
kills with each one of those this one

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
kills with each one of those this one
obviously<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:18.030> its<00:01:18.210> complications<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
obviously has its complications but it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
obviously has its complications but it
also<00:01:19.470> generates<00:01:19.770> quite<00:01:20.280> quick<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.820> not

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
also generates quite quick it's not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
also generates quite quick it's not
uncommon<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.479> me<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.320> or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
uncommon for me to get you know two or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
uncommon for me to get you know two or
three<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.009> per<00:01:23.220> life<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> that's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
three of these per life and that's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
three of these per life and that's
what's<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.659> unique<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.890> comes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
what's so unique about it is it comes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.429 
what's so unique about it is it comes
when<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> need<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> melee<00:01:27.930> feature<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
when you need it so the melee feature is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
when you need it so the melee feature is
extremely<00:01:29.280> badass<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> some

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
extremely badass now I did have some

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
extremely badass now I did have some
problems<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.250> seeing<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
problems with it you're seeing it in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
problems with it you're seeing it in
action<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
action right now but the one thing that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
action right now but the one thing that
I<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> lunge<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I had with it is not the lunge not the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.030 
I had with it is not the lunge not the
range<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
range because it's just right to be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
range because it's just right to be
completely<00:01:38.369> honest<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> fact<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
completely honest but just the fact that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
completely honest but just the fact that
to<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> thing<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.009> runs<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> really

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
to use this thing it runs out really

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
to use this thing it runs out really
really<00:01:41.729> quick<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.630> only<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:43.140> used<00:01:43.170> in

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
really quick and it can only be used in

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
really quick and it can only be used in
close<00:01:43.920> quarters<00:01:44.369> unlike<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
close quarters unlike you know the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.880 
close quarters unlike you know the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you can have this guy unfortunately is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
have to be very very close but there is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
have to be very very close but there is
a<00:01:55.350> compensation<00:01:56.130> period<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.909> where

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
a compensation period for this where

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
a compensation period for this where
you're<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:57.689> stuck<00:01:58.079> having<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.619> gun

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
out at all times like your Sparrow for

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
example you got that bow out that's all

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
example you got that bow out that's all
you<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.149> you're<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.630> charge<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you got to do it you're gonna charge it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.300 
you got to do it you're gonna charge it
up<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> gotta<00:02:04.439> roll<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> thing<00:02:05.159> with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
up you gotta roll with it the thing with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
up you gotta roll with it the thing with
this<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> actually<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> its

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this one and this is actually one of its

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
this one and this is actually one of its
best<00:02:06.990> bonuses<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.310> when<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.640> have

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
best bonuses if you will when you have

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
best bonuses if you will when you have
this<00:02:09.119> ability<00:02:09.420> activated<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
this ability activated you have the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
this ability activated you have the
freedom<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.280> using<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.760> primary<00:02:12.209> weapons

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
freedom of using your primary weapons

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.770 
freedom of using your primary weapons
and<00:02:12.780> everything<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and everything like that so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.480 
and everything like that so
it's<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.990> kind<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.319> use<00:02:14.560> when<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.890> need<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.160> at

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
it's a kind of use when you need to at

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's a kind of use when you need to at
the<00:02:15.610> same<00:02:15.819> time<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.020> also<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.380> flaw

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
the same time that is also a flaw

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.580 
the same time that is also a flaw
because<00:02:18.000> activating<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.120> thing<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.630> done<00:02:20.319> by

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
because activating this thing is done by

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
because activating this thing is done by
activating<00:02:21.370> both<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.700> bumpers<00:02:22.060> or

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
activating both the bumpers or

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.970 
activating both the bumpers or
activating<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.050> bumpers<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:23.800> from

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
activating the bumpers and then from

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.500 
activating the bumpers and then from
there<00:02:24.100> or<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.340> working<00:02:24.730> now<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.240> cool<00:02:25.480> thing

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
there or not working now the cool thing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.510 
there or not working now the cool thing
with<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.840> ability<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.830> double

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
with this ability is you can double

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.770 
with this ability is you can double
bumper<00:02:27.819> each<00:02:27.970> time<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.390> want<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.630> knife

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
bumper each time you want to knife

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.540 
bumper each time you want to knife
somebody<00:02:29.200> when<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.650> little<00:02:29.770> reticle<00:02:30.340> pops

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
somebody when that little reticle pops

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.340 
somebody when that little reticle pops
up<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.760> little<00:02:30.970> blue<00:02:31.239> symbol<00:02:31.690> will<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.080> top

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
up the little blue symbol will be on top

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.870 
up the little blue symbol will be on top
of<00:02:32.380> them<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:33.160> lets<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.430> know<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.610> you're

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
of them that lets you know that you're

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.340 
of them that lets you know that you're
in<00:02:33.910> melee<00:02:34.360> range<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.780> very<00:02:34.959> easy<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
in melee range it's very easy to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.110 
in melee range it's very easy to
actually<00:02:35.739> swipe<00:02:35.980> when<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
actually swipe when you see that on and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.790 
actually swipe when you see that on and
it<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.630> activate<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.350> little<00:02:38.470> inconsistent

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
it not activate it a little inconsistent

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.130 
it not activate it a little inconsistent
sometimes<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.390> either<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.959> or

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
sometimes but you can either do that or

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.930 
sometimes but you can either do that or
you<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.530> use<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.800> default<00:02:42.250> mail<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.580> button

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
you can use your default mail a button

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.970 
you can use your default mail a button
to<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.330> that's<00:02:43.450> pretty<00:02:43.780> cool<00:02:43.989> but<00:02:44.530> again<00:02:44.800> it's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
to so that's pretty cool but again it's

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.009 
to so that's pretty cool but again it's
big<00:02:45.190> flaw<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.180> runs<00:02:46.300> out<00:02:46.480> very<00:02:46.810> very

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
big flaw is that it runs out very very

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.630 
big flaw is that it runs out very very
fast<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.560> if<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.769> happen<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.100> kill<00:02:48.250> one<00:02:48.489> guy

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
fast and if you happen to kill one guy

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.150 
fast and if you happen to kill one guy
it's<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.269> uncommon<00:02:49.630> for<00:02:50.019> me<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.440> go<00:02:50.680> kill<00:02:50.980> one

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it's not uncommon for me to go kill one

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's not uncommon for me to go kill one
guy<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.610> not<00:02:51.700> even<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:51.970> anyone<00:02:52.600> else

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
guy and not even have anyone else

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.780 
guy and not even have anyone else
impossible<00:02:53.769> killing<00:02:54.070> range<00:02:54.280> throughout<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
impossible killing range throughout the
