head jet 2012 and there's a fair bit of
change<00:00:09.599> they've<00:00:09.840> made<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.200> these<00:00:10.429> aero<00:00:11.429> wheels

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
change they've made to these aero wheels

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.079 
change they've made to these aero wheels
this<00:00:12.630> year<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> course<00:00:13.639> these<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> wheels

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
this year of course these are the wheels

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.380 
this year of course these are the wheels

that Tony Martin won a time trial stage

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910 
that Tony Martin won a time trial stage
in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> Tour<00:00:18.810> de<00:00:18.930> France

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
in the Tour de France

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.599 
in the Tour de France
they<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.369> clinchers<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.720> time<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.369> Pro<00:00:23.369> Tour

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
they are clinchers first time a Pro Tour

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
they are clinchers first time a Pro Tour
Time<00:00:23.910> Trial<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.660> been<00:00:24.810> won<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Time Trial like that has been won on a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.970 
Time Trial like that has been won on a
on<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.670> clincher<00:00:27.150> race<00:00:27.840> wheel<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.439> done<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.800> one

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
on a clincher race wheel was done on one

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060 
on a clincher race wheel was done on one
of<00:00:29.010> these<00:00:29.130> head<00:00:29.369> Jets<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.650> they<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of these head Jets and they do have the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.400 
of these head Jets and they do have the
aluminum<00:00:32.430> braking<00:00:32.790> surface<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:34.230> are

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
aluminum braking surface so these are

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
aluminum braking surface so these are
very<00:00:34.620> durable<00:00:34.980> wheels<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.329> ridden

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
very durable wheels that can be ridden

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
very durable wheels that can be ridden
everyday<00:00:37.200> used<00:00:37.559> everyday<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.670> mean

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
everyday used everyday you know mean

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.490 
everyday used everyday you know mean
special<00:00:39.239> brake<00:00:39.450> pads<00:00:39.750> etc<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:41.129> big<00:00:41.280> changes

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
special brake pads etc the big changes

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
special brake pads etc the big changes
for<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.649> year<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
for this year or that we really have the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
for this year or that we really have the
rim<00:00:45.960> profile<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:46.710> looking<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.250> similar<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
rim profile now looking very similar to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
rim profile now looking very similar to
their<00:00:48.000> tubular<00:00:48.510> stinger<00:00:48.930> wheels<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
their tubular stinger wheels in that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.319 
their tubular stinger wheels in that
it's<00:00:50.340> really<00:00:50.820> blunt<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:52.489> around<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it's really blunt here around the the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's really blunt here around the the
edge<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> rim<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
edge of the rim so that's going to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.330 
edge of the rim so that's going to
improve<00:00:57.079> crosswind<00:00:58.079> handling<00:00:58.559> even<00:00:59.010> more

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
improve crosswind handling even more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.939 
improve crosswind handling even more
these<00:00:59.520> were<00:00:59.670> already<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.329> wheels<00:01:00.949> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
these were already really good wheels in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
these were already really good wheels in
crosswinds<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.110> blunt

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
crosswinds and now with this this blunt

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
crosswinds and now with this this blunt
their<00:01:04.619> shape<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.090> them

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
their shape it's going to make them

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.850 
their shape it's going to make them
really<00:01:06.900> handle<00:01:07.260> great<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
really handle great also a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.210 
really handle great also a

a<00:02:07.170> jet<00:02:07.770> 9<00:02:08.179> front<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> use<00:02:10.400> that's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
a jet 9 front that I use that's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.360 
a jet 9 front that I use that's
last<00:02:11.880> year's<00:02:12.150> model<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.470> difference<00:02:14.160> you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
last year's model and the difference you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.980 
last year's model and the difference you
can<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.550> obviously<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.540> carbon

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
can see obviously the the carbon

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.350 
can see obviously the the carbon
difference<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.220> unidirectional<00:02:17.670> versus

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
difference in the unidirectional versus

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.540 
difference in the unidirectional versus
the<00:02:18.480> cross-hatched<00:02:18.990> carbon<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.710> then<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the cross-hatched carbon and then that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.690 
the cross-hatched carbon and then that
the<00:02:21.210> sharpness<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> rim<00:02:22.200> profile<00:02:22.710> they

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the sharpness of the rim profile they

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700 
the sharpness of the rim profile they
were<00:02:23.760> still<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> good<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.570> sharper<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.410> on

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
were still a good bit sharper here on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.210 
were still a good bit sharper here on
the<00:02:26.160> edge<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.910> they<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the edge than they are now with this

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
the edge than they are now with this
very<00:02:29.220> blunt<00:02:29.610> build<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.750> course<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
very blunt build and of course the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.360 
very blunt build and of course the
weight<00:02:31.320> difference<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:31.920> mentioned<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
weight difference that we mentioned and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.140 
weight difference that we mentioned and
I'll<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.640> also<00:02:32.820> show<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.570> jet<00:02:34.530> six<00:02:35.150> which

about<00:03:10.470> these<00:03:10.800> wheels<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.750> c2<00:03:12.770> rim<00:03:13.770> profile

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
about these wheels the c2 rim profile

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.220 
about these wheels the c2 rim profile
that<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> full<00:03:15.890> 23<00:03:16.890> millimeter<00:03:17.340> wide

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
that you have a full 23 millimeter wide

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
that you have a full 23 millimeter wide
rim<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.890> wider<00:03:20.340> than<00:03:20.670> would

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
rim here so wider than would

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.120 
rim here so wider than would
historically<00:03:21.900> or<00:03:22.200> typically<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.739> seen<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.100> a

historically or typically be seen on a
lot<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.430> aero<00:03:23.730> wheels<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:25.550> provides<00:03:26.550> a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
lot of aero wheels and that provides a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.370 
lot of aero wheels and that provides a
different<00:03:28.110> tire<00:03:28.620> profile<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.930> basically<00:03:30.930> more

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
different tire profile a basically more

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.500 
different tire profile a basically more
straight<00:03:31.739> sided<00:03:32.040> tire<00:03:32.459> profile<00:03:33.060> when<00:03:33.330> that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
straight sided tire profile when that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.840 
straight sided tire profile when that
when<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> 23<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.100> 25<00:03:35.550> millimeter

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
when you have a 23 the 25 millimeter

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.680 
when you have a 23 the 25 millimeter
tire<00:03:36.720> mounted<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.769> these<00:03:38.400> rims<00:03:38.700> allows<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.600> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
tire mounted on these rims allows you to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.199 
tire mounted on these rims allows you to
run<00:03:39.780> lower<00:03:40.170> tire<00:03:40.590> pressure<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:42.030> better

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
run lower tire pressure for better

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.380 
run lower tire pressure for better
rolling<00:03:42.570> resistance<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.200> better<00:03:43.410> handling

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
rolling resistance and better handling

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.650 
rolling resistance and better handling
and<00:03:45.390> compared<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.900> some<00:03:46.140> really<00:03:46.320> skinny<00:03:47.660> race

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
and compared to some really skinny race

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750 
and compared to some really skinny race
wheels<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.739> say<00:03:49.860> as<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> bigger<00:03:50.250> guy<00:03:50.489> these

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
wheels I can say as a bigger guy these

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.750 
wheels I can say as a bigger guy these
things<00:03:51.030> handle<00:03:51.420> way<00:03:51.690> better<00:03:51.959> than<00:03:52.769> wheels

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
things handle way better than wheels

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.229 
things handle way better than wheels
that<00:03:53.970> are<00:03:54.000> made<00:03:54.239> for<00:03:54.450> narrower<00:03:54.810> profile<00:03:55.380> tires

turns<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.510> whatnot<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.200> feel<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.410> much

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
turns and whatnot they just feel so much

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.620 
turns and whatnot they just feel so much
more<00:03:59.360> sure-footed<00:04:00.360> than<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.600> real<00:04:01.140> skinny<00:04:01.590> hard

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630

tubular<00:04:03.630> tyre<00:04:03.870> for<00:04:04.110> instance<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.010> look<00:04:05.160> at

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
tubular tyre for instance we can look at

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.910 
tubular tyre for instance we can look at
the<00:04:05.790> last<00:04:06.030> year's<00:04:06.360> one<00:04:06.570> has<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.959> same<00:04:07.230> c2<00:04:07.680> rim

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
the last year's one has that same c2 rim

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.970 
the last year's one has that same c2 rim
and<00:04:08.100> we<00:04:08.160> can<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.959> 23<00:04:10.590> millimeter

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and we can see the this 23 millimeter
