00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
use Oreos nobody can tell that it's not

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.480 
use Oreos nobody can tell that it's not
circular<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> hides<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.100> little

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
circular it just kind of hides a little

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.640 
circular it just kind of hides a little
imperfections<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.930> good<00:02:13.200> ones<00:02:13.350> i

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
imperfections and then my good ones i

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.960 
imperfections and then my good ones i
just<00:02:13.860> put<00:02:14.010> sprinkles<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.460> because<00:02:14.700> i<00:02:14.760> wanted

to show off how good those how good the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.710 
to show off how good those how good the
circle<00:02:17.430> shape<00:02:17.459> was<00:02:17.970> anyway<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.040> yeah<00:02:20.720> here

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
circle shape was anyway so yeah here

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.810 
circle shape was anyway so yeah here
I'll<00:02:21.900> show<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:22.470> how<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.709> dip<00:02:23.100> them<00:02:28.550> okay<00:02:29.550> so

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
I'll show you all how I dip them okay so

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.150 
I'll show you all how I dip them okay so
basically<00:02:31.520> just<00:02:32.520> take<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.830> this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
basically just take this and then this

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.550 
basically just take this and then this
is<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> double<00:02:35.820> boiler<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.140> dip

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
is like a double boiler and then I dip

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
is like a double boiler and then I dip
it<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.800> here<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.250> cover<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.670> make<00:02:39.450> sure<00:02:39.480> it's

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it in here and cover it make sure it's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.180 
it in here and cover it make sure it's
all<00:02:39.840> covered<00:02:40.110> i<00:02:40.410> use<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> spatula<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.459> make<00:02:42.390> sure

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
all covered i use a spatula to make sure

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.690 
all covered i use a spatula to make sure
all<00:02:44.270> sides<00:02:45.270> are<00:02:45.570> covers<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.550> i<00:02:47.610> do

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
all sides are covers and then when i do

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.960 
all sides are covers and then when i do
i<00:02:50.090> basically<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.209> kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.780> turn<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.520> hit

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
i basically just kind of turn it and hit

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
i basically just kind of turn it and hit
it<00:02:54.000> against<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.510> pan<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:54.840> bit<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it against the pan a little bit just to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.860 
it against the pan a little bit just to
make<00:02:56.220> sure<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> extra<00:02:57.180> icing<00:02:57.270> us<00:02:57.690> off<00:02:59.870> do

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
make sure all the extra icing us off do

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:12.130 
make sure all the extra icing us off do
this<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.020> about<00:03:01.260> 30<00:03:01.590> seconds

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.840 

I<00:03:12.230> remember<00:03:13.010> after<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:14.480> put<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.850> garnishes

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
I remember after you put the garnishes

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270 
I remember after you put the garnishes
on<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.420> i'm<00:03:17.600> using<00:03:17.750> oreo<00:03:18.290> crumbles<00:03:18.800> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
on here like i'm using oreo crumbles and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.340 
on here like i'm using oreo crumbles and
sprinkles<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.810> after<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.140> put<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
sprinkles it's like after you put the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.690 
sprinkles it's like after you put the
garnishes<00:03:21.770> on<00:03:21.920> there<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:24.380> need<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.430> probably

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
garnishes on there you need to probably

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.490 
garnishes on there you need to probably
put<00:03:26.000> them<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.330> fridge<00:03:26.690> make<00:03:27.170> sure<00:03:27.200> they

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
put them in the fridge make sure they

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.710 
put them in the fridge make sure they
like<00:03:27.680> Harden<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.190> stuff<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:29.180> make<00:03:29.300> sure<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
like Harden and stuff to make sure this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.570 
like Harden and stuff to make sure this
candy<00:03:30.200> melts<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:31.030> Arden<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:33.280> think<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.400> could

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
candy melts up Arden I think you could

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.840 
candy melts up Arden I think you could
melt<00:03:34.760> down<00:03:35.000> icing<00:03:36.100> maybe<00:03:37.100> I'm<00:03:37.430> not<00:03:37.610> really

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
melt down icing maybe I'm not really

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.180 
melt down icing maybe I'm not really
sure<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.330> just<00:03:38.540> use<00:03:38.690> candy<00:03:39.080> bucket<00:03:39.200> I'm<00:03:39.680> new<00:03:40.070> at

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
sure I just use candy bucket I'm new at

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.590 
sure I just use candy bucket I'm new at
this<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.700> candy<00:03:40.970> milfs<00:03:41.270> are<00:03:41.450> like

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.870 
this and a candy milfs are like
foolproof<00:03:42.110> basically<00:03:43.270> okay<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.630> one<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.880> not

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
foolproof basically okay this one is not

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.210 
foolproof basically okay this one is not
very<00:03:47.420> perfect<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.140> got<00:03:48.320> some<00:03:48.500> imperfections

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
very perfect it's got some imperfections

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.979

oreos<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.750> hide<00:03:56.930> them<00:03:57.260> sectioned

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:30.170 

okay<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:27.889> like<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.039> make<00:04:29.190> sure<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.610> whole<00:04:29.820> thing

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
okay I like to make sure the whole thing

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:40.909 
okay I like to make sure the whole thing
is<00:04:30.389> covered<00:04:38.030> ok<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.840> then<00:04:40.020> shake<00:04:40.560> off<00:04:40.740> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
is covered ok so then shake off the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.640 
is covered ok so then shake off the
extra<00:04:41.220> Oreo<00:04:41.610> crumbs<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.600> then<00:04:43.020> while<00:04:43.259> i<00:04:43.289> do<00:04:43.500> it

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
extra Oreo crumbs and then while i do it

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.040 
extra Oreo crumbs and then while i do it
like<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> Styrofoam<00:04:45.360> tray<00:04:45.389> i<00:04:45.690> had<00:04:45.930> to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
like this is a Styrofoam tray i had to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.800 
like this is a Styrofoam tray i had to
cut<00:04:46.289> it<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.590> I'm<00:04:46.740> fit<00:04:46.949> in<00:04:47.039> my<00:04:47.160> fridge<00:04:47.780> then<00:04:48.780> I

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
cut it so I'm fit in my fridge then I

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.070 
cut it so I'm fit in my fridge then I
stick<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:50.120> down<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.180> there<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.870> holds

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
stick it down in there and it holds

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.830 
stick it down in there and it holds
pretty<00:04:52.530> well<00:04:52.850> like<00:04:53.850> another<00:04:54.090> trick<00:04:54.449> is<00:04:54.660> if

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
pretty well like another trick is if

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.570 
pretty well like another trick is if
you're<00:04:55.080> giving<00:04:55.410> these<00:04:55.590> out<00:04:55.800> like<00:04:56.039> individual

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
you're giving these out like individual

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.700 
you're giving these out like individual
you<00:04:56.729> could<00:04:56.910> just<00:04:57.060> get<00:04:57.330> like<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.510> cup<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.500> fill

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
you could just get like a cup and fill

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.310 
you could just get like a cup and fill
sugar<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.789> like<00:05:00.479> if<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.750> just<00:05:00.870> fill<00:05:01.110> with

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
sugar and like if you just fill with

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.800 
sugar and like if you just fill with
regular<00:05:02.419> sugar<00:05:03.680> then<00:05:04.680> it'll<00:05:05.039> hold<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:06.180> also

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
regular sugar then it'll hold that also

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.750 
regular sugar then it'll hold that also
like<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.020> make<00:05:07.380> sure<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:08.220> allows<00:05:08.490> them<00:05:08.520> to

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
like to make sure that allows them to
