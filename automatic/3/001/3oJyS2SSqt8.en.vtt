femur in the tibia and if I put my hands

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
femur in the tibia and if I put my hands
above<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.309> below<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.850> elicit<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
above and below and I can elicit this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
above and below and I can elicit this
type<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> manipulation<00:01:04.970> called<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> drawer

type of manipulation called the drawer

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.350 
type of manipulation called the drawer
sign<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.310> conclusive<00:01:09.030> for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
sign it is really conclusive for

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
sign it is really conclusive for
cruciate<00:01:09.930> ligament<00:01:10.409> tear<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
cruciate ligament tear and so it's in a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
cruciate ligament tear and so it's in a
complete<00:01:12.720> tear<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.710> easy

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
complete tear can be a very easy

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.270 
complete tear can be a very easy
diagnosis<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> make<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.320> partial<00:01:16.860> tear<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
diagnosis to make in a partial tear it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
diagnosis to make in a partial tear it
can<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.479> challenging<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
can be a little bit more challenging in

meniscus<00:02:54.780> there<00:02:55.439> are<00:02:55.500> actually<00:02:55.769> several

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
meniscus there are actually several

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.409 
meniscus there are actually several

structures but that's the most

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.509 
structures but that's the most
noteworthy<00:02:57.689> because<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.469> very<00:02:58.650> commonly<00:02:59.219> will

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
noteworthy because we very commonly will

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.509 
noteworthy because we very commonly will
see<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.000> tear<00:03:00.419> as<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:01.260> drawer<00:03:01.739> manipulation

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
see that tear as the drawer manipulation

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.409 
see that tear as the drawer manipulation
occurs<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.310> commonly<00:03:05.310> cause<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.639> tear<00:03:06.150> in

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
occurs it will commonly cause a tear in

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.869 
occurs it will commonly cause a tear in
the<00:03:06.540> back<00:03:06.750> part<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.560> meniscus<00:03:08.069> it's

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
the back part of the meniscus it's

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.330 
the back part of the meniscus it's
really<00:03:09.569> impossible<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.379> identify<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.069> most

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
really impossible to identify in most

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
really impossible to identify in most
situations<00:03:11.579> on<00:03:12.359> physical<00:03:13.230> exam<00:03:13.700> although

situations on physical exam although

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.059 
situations on physical exam although
sometimes<00:03:14.939> we<00:03:15.329> will<00:03:15.599> appreciate<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.500> popping

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
sometimes we will appreciate a popping

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.039 
sometimes we will appreciate a popping
sensation<00:03:17.280> which<00:03:17.940> could<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.329> characteristic

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
sensation which could be characteristic

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.990 
sensation which could be characteristic
with<00:03:19.169> that<00:03:19.349> it's<00:03:20.099> something<00:03:20.549> though<00:03:20.699> that<00:03:20.729> we

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
with that it's something though that we

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000 
with that it's something though that we
do<00:03:21.180> need<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.389> identify<00:03:21.659> at<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> time<00:03:22.799> of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
do need to identify at the time of

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.159 
do need to identify at the time of
surgery<00:03:23.310> because<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.329> torn<00:03:24.659> we<00:03:24.900> need<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
surgery because if it's torn we need to

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.750 
surgery because if it's torn we need to
remove<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.650> torn<00:03:25.919> portion<00:03:28.489> okay<00:03:29.489> now<00:03:29.699> I'm

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
remove the torn portion okay now I'm

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
old-fashioned technique it's been around

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.110 
old-fashioned technique it's been around
for<00:03:42.840> about<00:03:42.930> 40<00:03:43.049> years<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.939> it's<00:03:44.939> still<00:03:45.090> used

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
for about 40 years and it's still used

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.539 
for about 40 years and it's still used
quite<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.599> bit<00:03:45.689> these<00:03:46.019> days<00:03:46.079> it's<00:03:46.979> a<00:03:47.099> technique

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
quite a bit these days it's a technique

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.819 
quite a bit these days it's a technique
that<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.909> use<00:03:48.150> primarily<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.409> smaller

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
that we use primarily in the smaller

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.689 
that we use primarily in the smaller
breed<00:03:50.189> dogs<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.879> cats<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.979> will<00:03:53.250> use<00:03:53.489> it

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
breed dogs and cats but we will use it

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.399 
breed dogs and cats but we will use it
occasionally<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.659> larger<00:03:55.109> breeds

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
occasionally in the larger breeds

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.710 
occasionally in the larger breeds
especially<00:03:56.099> for<00:03:56.310> financial<00:03:56.909> concerns<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.599> is

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
especially for financial concerns it is

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
especially for financial concerns it is
a<00:03:57.750> bit<00:03:57.959> less<00:03:58.109> expensive<00:03:58.319> than<00:03:59.009> some<00:03:59.189> of<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
a bit less expensive than some of the

a bit less expensive than some of the
other<00:03:59.609> techniques<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:01.290> let<00:04:01.439> me<00:04:01.530> go<00:04:02.099> through

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
other techniques so let me go through

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.420 
other techniques so let me go through
the<00:04:02.430> procedure<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.259> talk<00:04:04.259> a<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.560> more<00:04:04.739> about

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
the procedure and talk a bit more about

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.490 
the procedure and talk a bit more about
the<00:04:05.609> aftercare<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.470> complications

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.290 

so<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.740> looking<00:04:14.100> at<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> joint<00:04:14.670> from<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
so this is looking at the joint from the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.500 
so this is looking at the joint from the
front<00:04:15.950> over<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.670> see<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> tear<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.420> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
front over here we see a tear of the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.610 
front over here we see a tear of the
cruciate<00:04:18.930> ligament<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.930> over<00:04:22.140> here<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.560> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
cruciate ligament and over here this is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.300 
cruciate ligament and over here this is
the<00:04:22.890> medial<00:04:23.250> meniscus<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.600> any<00:04:24.990> torn<00:04:25.530> parts<00:04:26.070> we

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
the medial meniscus so any torn parts we

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.280 
the medial meniscus so any torn parts we
take<00:04:26.550> out<00:04:26.760> we<00:04:27.180> have<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.450> view<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.990> entire

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
take out we have the view of the entire

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.430 
take out we have the view of the entire
joint<00:04:28.650> during<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.160> surgical<00:04:29.640> procedure<00:04:30.000> now

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.620 

the<00:04:34.440> next<00:04:34.860> step<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.550> put<00:04:35.850> in<00:04:36.060> essentially

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
the next step is to put in essentially

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.540 
the next step is to put in essentially
an<00:04:36.720> artificial<00:04:37.350> ligament<00:04:37.800> there's<00:04:38.070> various

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
an artificial ligament there's various

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.030 
an artificial ligament there's various
structures<00:04:38.930> most<00:04:39.930> people<00:04:40.380> including<00:04:40.680> myself

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
structures most people including myself

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.150 
structures most people including myself
use<00:04:41.580> synthetic<00:04:42.360> nylon<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.380> act<00:04:43.560> as<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.040> new

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
use synthetic nylon to act as the new

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.750 
use synthetic nylon to act as the new
ligament<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:45.919> looped<00:04:46.919> behind<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.550> little

diagonally<00:04:50.669> through<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:50.970> hole<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.450> we<00:04:51.570> drill

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
diagonally through a hole that we drill

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.190 
diagonally through a hole that we drill
in<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.800> tibia<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.550> then<00:04:54.090> we<00:04:54.330> pull<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> suture

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
in the tibia and then we pull the suture

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.740 
in the tibia and then we pull the suture
back<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.740> secure<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.610> using<00:04:56.850> a<00:04:57.330> metallic

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.619 

so<00:05:06.900> immediately<00:05:07.530> after<00:05:07.650> surgery<00:05:08.129> that<00:05:09.000> drawer

I'd<00:06:06.719> say<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.229> less<00:06:07.440> than<00:06:07.469> a<00:06:07.710> 1%<00:06:07.949> chance<00:06:08.669> of

I'd say that to less than a 1% chance of

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.939 
I'd say that to less than a 1% chance of
that<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.479> usually<00:06:09.870> there's<00:06:10.169> some<00:06:10.259> trauma

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
time and a month out we can increase it

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.950 
time and a month out we can increase it
by<00:07:10.120> a<00:07:10.150> few<00:07:10.420> minutes

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
by a few minutes

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.660 
by a few minutes
six<00:07:11.200> weeks<00:07:11.410> out<00:07:11.680> we<00:07:11.950> increase<00:07:12.310> it<00:07:12.490> a<00:07:12.520> little

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
six weeks out we increase it a little

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.610 
six weeks out we increase it a little
bit<00:07:12.820> more<00:07:13.000> that<00:07:13.720> gets<00:07:13.900> us<00:07:14.110> to<00:07:14.140> about<00:07:14.380> eight

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
bit more that gets us to about eight

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.370 
bit more that gets us to about eight
weeks<00:07:14.830> out<00:07:15.160> by<00:07:15.790> that<00:07:15.970> point<00:07:16.330> most<00:07:16.570> dogs<00:07:16.960> are

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
weeks out by that point most dogs are

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.580 
weeks out by that point most dogs are
using<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:17.920> leg<00:07:18.100> reasonably<00:07:18.880> well<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.810> smaller

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
using the leg reasonably well a smaller

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.340 
using the leg reasonably well a smaller
breed<00:07:20.980> is<00:07:21.760> more<00:07:22.150> likely<00:07:22.540> to<00:07:22.660> be<00:07:22.780> pretty<00:07:23.110> close

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
breed is more likely to be pretty close

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.560 
breed is more likely to be pretty close
to<00:07:23.410> normal<00:07:23.950> while<00:07:24.220> the<00:07:24.400> larger<00:07:24.820> dogs<00:07:25.090> are

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
to normal while the larger dogs are

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.990 
to normal while the larger dogs are
probably<00:07:25.990> still<00:07:26.320> limping<00:07:26.740> a<00:07:26.860> fair<00:07:27.100> bit<00:07:27.370> but

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
probably still limping a fair bit but

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.970 
probably still limping a fair bit but
even<00:07:28.420> so<00:07:28.630> at<00:07:28.870> that<00:07:29.050> point<00:07:29.350> we<00:07:29.470> will<00:07:29.590> start

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:29.980 
even so at that point we will start

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.210 
even so at that point we will start
rapidly<00:07:30.850> adding<00:07:31.210> more<00:07:31.420> activity<00:07:32.110> and<00:07:32.350> so<00:07:33.010> that

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
rapidly adding more activity and so that

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.950 
rapidly adding more activity and so that
the<00:07:33.340> goal<00:07:33.550> is<00:07:33.760> by<00:07:33.910> three<00:07:34.240> months<00:07:34.540> out<00:07:34.690> we're

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
the goal is by three months out we're

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.390 
the goal is by three months out we're
back<00:07:35.110> to<00:07:35.350> completely<00:07:35.770> normal<00:07:36.250> activity<00:07:38.040> so<00:07:39.040> it

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 
back to completely normal activity so it

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.830 
back to completely normal activity so it
is<00:07:39.550> a<00:07:39.580> very<00:07:39.820> good<00:07:40.030> technique<00:07:40.240> as<00:07:40.600> I<00:07:40.690> say

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
is a very good technique as I say

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.870 
is a very good technique as I say
especially<00:07:41.140> for<00:07:41.380> the<00:07:41.470> smaller<00:07:41.770> dogs<00:07:42.130> but<00:07:42.730> for

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 
especially for the smaller dogs but for

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.420 
especially for the smaller dogs but for
the<00:07:42.970> larger<00:07:43.360> dogs<00:07:43.710> typically<00:07:44.710> we<00:07:44.860> consider<00:07:45.010> it

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430 
the larger dogs typically we consider it

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.150 
the larger dogs typically we consider it
a<00:07:45.550> second<00:07:45.940> choice
