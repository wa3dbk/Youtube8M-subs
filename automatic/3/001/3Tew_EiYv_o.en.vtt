00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
into the studio and we have to figure

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.279 
into the studio and we have to figure
out<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.449> long<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
out how long it's going to take to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.320 
out how long it's going to take to
explode<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.859> rather<00:00:32.009> our<00:00:32.279> two<00:00:32.610> contestants<00:00:33.180> do

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
explode or rather our two contestants do

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.509 
explode or rather our two contestants do
we've<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.629> brandy<00:00:34.050> she<00:00:34.260> guessed<00:00:34.470> 90<00:00:34.949> seconds

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
we've got brandy she guessed 90 seconds

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.369 
we've got brandy she guessed 90 seconds
it<00:00:35.910> would<00:00:36.059> take<00:00:36.239> 90<00:00:36.600> seconds<00:00:37.019> for<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.290> them

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
it would take 90 seconds for one of them

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.280 
it would take 90 seconds for one of them
to<00:00:37.410> explode<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> Mike<00:00:38.610> guest<00:00:39.059> 42<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> goal<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to explode and Mike guest 42 the goal is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
to explode and Mike guest 42 the goal is
just<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.650> The<00:00:40.739> Price<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.949> Right<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.790> get<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just like The Price is Right to get it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
just like The Price is Right to get it
as<00:00:42.210> close<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:43.110> accurate<00:00:43.289> as<00:00:43.590> possible<00:00:43.620> without

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
as close to accurate as possible without

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
as close to accurate as possible without
going<00:00:44.610> over<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> takes<00:00:46.050> any<00:00:46.320> longer

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
going over so if it takes any longer

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
going over so if it takes any longer
than<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> minute<00:00:47.219> 30<00:00:47.610> brandi<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> win

than a minute 30 brandi is going to win

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.160 
than a minute 30 brandi is going to win
if<00:00:49.199> it's<00:00:49.559> somewhere<00:00:49.829> between<00:00:50.390> 42<00:00:51.390> seconds<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
if it's somewhere between 42 seconds and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.549 
if it's somewhere between 42 seconds and
i'm<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.309> 30<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.660> Mike<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.320> gonna

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
i'm in at 30 then I then Mike is gonna

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
i'm in at 30 then I then Mike is gonna
win<00:00:55.800> otherwise<00:00:56.010> we'll<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> figure<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
win otherwise we'll have to figure it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
win otherwise we'll have to figure it
out<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.300> easy<00:00:57.480> game<00:00:57.719> we're<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:58.020> put

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
out it's an easy game we're gonna put

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
out it's an easy game we're gonna put
stock<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.890> microwave<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.520> over<00:01:00.359> there

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
stock in that microwave right over there

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.100 
stock in that microwave right over there
and<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.940> splode<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and we are going to make it splode or I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.509 
and we are going to make it splode or I
don't<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.440> if<00:01:04.559> Twinkies<00:01:04.920> explode<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
don't know if Twinkies explode but I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.980 
don't know if Twinkies explode but I
figure<00:01:05.910> if<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.149> keep<00:01:06.300> them<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.539> the<00:01:06.630> wrapping

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
figure if we keep them in the wrapping
