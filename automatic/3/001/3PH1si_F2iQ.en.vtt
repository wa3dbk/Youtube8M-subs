00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.069
 good night silence please 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.290
 we started the press conference 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 postpartum a sports union the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.699
 palms of Mr. Don Sergio Lobera as 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.020
 always request the floor of the floor 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.020
 to realize the deepest colors 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.230
 sergio how good can you explain the 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.480
 authentic debacle to all I think what 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.040
 that we are very sore with the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.970
 next I think we have scratched the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.970
 shame good yes it is true that the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.879
 hobby has to be hurt us 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.510
 we are also disappointed to have 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.460
 disappointed the fans I think the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.190
 development of the party has 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.670
 conditioned by a play 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.280
 very early in the 18th minute where a 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 expulsion in boxes a goal conditions you 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.589
 absolutely the game but good only 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.899
 is to apologize to the fans because 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.420
 because today you can despite the 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.589
 circumstances we will be at the height 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.320
 we know perfectly what it means 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.900
 for for our people 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.909
 a match of these characteristics and the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.500
 true that today we leave here because 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.610
 very hurt especially for what we have 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 done in the field of the game but 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 also for what that means for 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.770
 our people 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.290
 from the distance that I am not 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.290
 I appreciate and I can not value it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.190
 lack of power of action for what 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.450
 I believe that the power of reaction is 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.010
 conditioned at the moment that you 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.930
 you face a team that is with 10 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.250
 players that is us with 10 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.630
 players the opposing team in 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.290
 numerical superiority and ahead in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.270
 the marker I think is a reaction 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.650
 that can not be done in terms 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.260
 normal because it's not a situation 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.460
 normal 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.930
 I think that in the wake of the last stretch of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.300
 the first part is when we have 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.100
 been a little bit more involved in the 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.840
 party but but later in the second 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.000
 part after the second goal of the pair of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.040
 party has been broken they have had 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.890
 many more options than us 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.720
 we have not been well and only 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.670
 is to congratulate the tenerife to know 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.800
 manage a situation that has been 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.800
 put on face and know how to take the game 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.640
 prior to the meeting 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.620
 they could assume that Tenerife is the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.140
 hack 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.250
 no I do not think I think my words 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.069
 He who listens to all of them and does not get 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.470
 context a phrase are the same as 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.670
 could repeat today I do not think that the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.830
 tenerife has done a very good job 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 who is doing a very good job in 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.879
 No time have I tried 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.670
 not to discredit work 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.690
 of a partner like Alvaro Cervera and the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.790
 that wanted to heat the environment 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 removing from context a phrase of mine 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.549
 that I have done it in no time 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.989
 that was my intention and I do not think that 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.410
 be a condition to win or lose 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.110
 a match like today 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.220
 sergio two questions the first as 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.860
 value to the first twenty minutes 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.590
 before the expulsion of barbosa from your 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.390
 team and the second if you think that the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.750
 team never finished getting into 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.170
 account 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.880
 the first 20 minutes that are the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.940
 Analyzables from a more real perspective 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.230
 because we were against 11 I think they 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.510
 they have come out better and they have known 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.790
 so to make us not be 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.299
 comfortable it has cost us to get into the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.680
 match and in the reaction is what 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.780
 I was commenting earlier, I think it's 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 a conditioned reaction where are you 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.610
 behind on the scoreboard with a man 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.049
 less and we make it a little bit we have 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.750
 assumed risks we have not wanted 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.640
 put back waiting for the 1-0 you have to 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.860
 get to where the option will come if what 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.530
 we have tried you can go a little bit more 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.849
 above that supposes that we enable many 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.530
 spaces against the team 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.530
 opposite and has known how to take advantage 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.400
 for a game like that hurt hurts over 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 everything for what it means for our 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.150
 hobby as I said earlier 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.769
 but we have to raise head we are 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.480
 professionals this is a hard stick 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.580
 we have to recognize it but we have to 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.980
 raise your head keep working 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.180
 realize that this game is no longer 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.470
 we can do nothing that the only thing that 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.080
 we have to do is learn from that 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.610
 that we can draw conclusions from what 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.250
 what happened today but think of the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.980
 next party get up and make it 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.260
 that is a hard blow 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.830
 and keep working and try to make the 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.030
 team follow beach area let's continue in the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.080
 path that we took so far and 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.280
 try because the team gets over 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.280
 a stick that obviously is not 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.849
 you usually changed aranda with a 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.569
 maybe what he was doing then fine 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.909
 clearing the equipment was dead late 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.020
 the changes against those of ridges that 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.449
 If you want to be 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.900
 can take its toll on the future is 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.630
 a derby 30 over many 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.520
 good in the alignment there were changes that 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.249
 they were forced by the numerous casualties 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.589
 with which we went to the game 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.679
 in the top part the change of 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:23.259
 Aranda por Crisantos is because it 

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:24.999
 anticipated a game with fewer spaces a 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.249
 match of a more positional attack and 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.229
 considered that aranda in that kind of 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.999
 game could help us more and the 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.889
 participation of high rises could be 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.299
 the later in a game maybe more 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.109
 open and with more spaces that is where 

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:39.759
 he feels more comfortable about the change 

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:43.029
 also in forced bands was a bit 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.549
 for work also there was also doubt 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.499
 between asdrúbal and momo we have bet a 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:50.679
 little bit more from experience 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:52.119
 veteranía and wait for the option of in 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:54.729
 function of how the match was to give 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:56.559
 the participation to the place changes the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.699
 first it was at 18 minutes because 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.319
 it has been a change that had to be made 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.819
 the second has been at rest so 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.889
 I do not think it's taken so long to do 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.089
 the changes so much and the third had to 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.669
 wait because concept was with 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:08.919
 discomfort now it was not advisable that 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.589
 I played 90 minutes we saw Juan Carlos 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.509
 tired and what we have tried is 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.609
 wait at the end to make a change 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.620
 that we had in three possible that 

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:20.240
 could give on the pitch 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.660
 to point out that the environment of the 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.660
 rodríguez lópez 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.310
 for the terrible 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.460
 as a team for what 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.650
 it is not difficult to value a party 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.720
 like today's not because really to 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.289
 we are not any party seen the 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.969
 final result 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.680
 but it is true that good that 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.199
 note that it is a derby that are 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 conditioning factors different from any 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.570
 another party 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.420
 and unfortunately we have to live the part 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.890
 bitter of all that is a term the 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.380
 tenerife on a team that is doing 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.780
 a good job a team that has known 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.910
 get out of one of a bad dynamic in a 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.890
 bad start to the season and has put 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.690
 as on merit fruit of 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.330
 work not of chance in the 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.740
 position that occupies and this season the 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.080
 second division season is a 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.790
 very long season and now you can 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.990
 mark goals beyond going match 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.020
 I think it's complicated not to party 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.550
 I think Tenerife will be seen later 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.560
 if he is able to get something else 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.660
 that the goal that you have marked that 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.990
 it is the good permanence 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.990
 Thank you 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.150
