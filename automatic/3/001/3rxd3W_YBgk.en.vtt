00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
way they built this with the angle um it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.219 
way they built this with the angle um it
fits<00:04:14.380> very<00:04:14.620> comfortably<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.250> hand<00:04:15.340> um<00:04:16.229> it

fits very comfortably in the hand um it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.570 
fits very comfortably in the hand um it
doesn't<00:04:17.440> feels<00:04:17.709> bulky<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.280> know<00:04:18.459> what's

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
doesn't feels bulky you know what's

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.039 
doesn't feels bulky you know what's
funny<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.270> put<00:04:19.750> my<00:04:19.900> finger<00:04:20.140> here

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
funny is I put my finger here

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.350 
funny is I put my finger here
and<00:04:21.169> probably<00:04:22.039> more<00:04:22.250> comfortably<00:04:22.729> grip<00:04:23.150> my

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
and probably more comfortably grip my

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.779 
and probably more comfortably grip my
samsung<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.409> it<00:04:24.860> doesn't<00:04:25.190> add<00:04:25.310> much<00:04:25.340> weight

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
samsung and it doesn't add much weight

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.899 
samsung and it doesn't add much weight
than<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> weight<00:04:26.389> that<00:04:26.599> i<00:04:26.690> had<00:04:26.960> with<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.470> a

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
than the weight that i had with the a

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.520 
than the weight that i had with the a
leather<00:04:28.909> case<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.449> little<00:04:29.990> bit<00:04:30.080> more<00:04:30.259> weight

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
leather case a little bit more weight

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.680 
leather case a little bit more weight
because<00:04:31.520> there<00:04:31.669> is<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:31.819> battery<00:04:32.270> that's<00:04:32.360> in

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
because there is a battery that's in

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.119 
because there is a battery that's in
there<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:34.449> see<00:04:35.449> if<00:04:35.569> we<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.870> figure<00:04:36.830> out<00:04:36.949> how

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
there but see if we can figure out how

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.869 
there but see if we can figure out how
to<00:04:37.190> activate<00:04:37.639> it<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:40.250> know<00:04:40.370> when<00:04:40.490> i<00:04:40.520> put<00:04:40.759> this

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
to activate it you know when i put this

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.219 
to activate it you know when i put this
in<00:04:41.180> i'm<00:04:42.020> not<00:04:42.379> sure<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.710> i<00:04:42.889> plugged<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.430> in<00:04:43.580> to

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
in i'm not sure that i plugged it in to

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.089 
in i'm not sure that i plugged it in to
the<00:04:45.229> hole<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.370> maybe<00:04:46.720> yes<00:04:47.720> ok<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:48.560> what

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
the hole and that maybe yes ok so what

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.170 
the hole and that maybe yes ok so what
it<00:04:49.190> looks<00:04:49.370> like<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.610> looks<00:04:49.639> like<00:04:49.940> there's<00:04:50.120> a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
it looks like it looks like there's a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.260 
it looks like it looks like there's a
wire<00:04:50.479> that's<00:04:50.900> in<00:04:51.139> there<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.729> this<00:04:52.940> may<00:04:53.120> work

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
wire that's in there and this may work

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.420 
wire that's in there and this may work
out<00:04:53.449> good<00:04:53.690> because<00:04:54.229> if<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.889> don't<00:04:55.069> want<00:04:55.340> to

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
out good because if you don't want to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.950 
out good because if you don't want to
charge<00:04:55.699> it<00:04:55.909> you<00:04:56.210> know<00:04:56.330> one<00:04:56.539> thing<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.930> to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
charge it you know one thing I like to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.409 
charge it you know one thing I like to
do<00:04:57.169> is<00:04:57.289> I<00:04:57.379> have<00:04:57.469> to<00:04:57.590> drain<00:04:57.800> my<00:04:58.090> devices<00:04:59.090> down

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
do is I have to drain my devices down

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.869 
do is I have to drain my devices down
all<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.780> way<00:04:59.930> before<00:05:00.199> I<00:05:00.500> start<00:05:01.280> charging<00:05:01.729> them

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
all the way before I start charging them

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.029 
all the way before I start charging them
so<00:05:02.539> that<00:05:02.569> way<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.870> can<00:05:03.199> get<00:05:03.319> as<00:05:03.500> far<00:05:03.650> as<00:05:03.800> they<00:05:03.889> can

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
so that way I can get as far as they can

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.980 
so that way I can get as far as they can
in<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.280> part<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.610> your<00:05:04.699> event<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.780> looks<00:05:05.930> like

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
in a part of your event so it looks like

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.469 
in a part of your event so it looks like
it<00:05:06.259> will<00:05:06.349> go<00:05:06.560> into<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.219> case<00:05:09.909> let's<00:05:10.909> retry

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
it will go into the case let's retry

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.709 
it will go into the case let's retry
this<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:13.580> looks<00:05:13.669> like<00:05:13.879> a<00:05:13.969> go<00:05:14.180> into<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.479> case

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
this it looks like a go into the case

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.170 
this it looks like a go into the case
without<00:05:14.930> having<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.560> plug<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.979> in<00:05:16.129> I<00:05:16.340> like<00:05:17.000> that

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
without having to plug it in I like that

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.839 
without having to plug it in I like that
feature<00:05:17.449> I<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:17.810> that<00:05:18.110> very<00:05:18.379> much<00:05:18.789> some<00:05:19.789> of

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
feature I like that very much some of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.820 
feature I like that very much some of
these<00:05:19.909> cases<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.539> I<00:05:20.569> have<00:05:20.870> especially<00:05:21.530> for

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
these cases that I have especially for

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.420 
these cases that I have especially for
the<00:05:21.889> iOS<00:05:22.190> product<00:05:22.729> um<00:05:23.080> they<00:05:24.580> they<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.759> course

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.219 
the iOS product um they they of course
taken<00:05:28.430> start<00:05:28.759> charging<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.240> away<00:05:29.479> so

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
taken start charging right away so

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.019 
taken start charging right away so
what's<00:05:30.710> interesting<00:05:30.949> about<00:05:31.250> this<00:05:31.520> case<00:05:31.759> too

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
what's interesting about this case too

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.420 
what's interesting about this case too
is<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:33.259> don't<00:05:33.409> know<00:05:33.469> if<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> see<00:05:33.889> this<00:05:34.009> but<00:05:34.279> I

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
is I don't know if you see this but I

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.399 
is I don't know if you see this but I
can<00:05:34.669> pull<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.000> wire<00:05:35.240> out<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.779> comes<00:05:35.990> out<00:05:36.199> just

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
can pull the wire out it comes out just

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.930 
can pull the wire out it comes out just
a<00:05:36.560> little<00:05:36.590> bit<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:37.219> just<00:05:37.430> kind<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.639> hides

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
a little bit and it just kind of hides

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.659 
a little bit and it just kind of hides
down<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.259> here<00:05:39.680> in<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.009> bottom<00:05:40.250> there's<00:05:40.610> a

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
down in here in the bottom there's a

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.209 
down in here in the bottom there's a
little<00:05:40.880> kind<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.569> Inlet<00:05:42.080> hole<00:05:42.349> where<00:05:43.039> that

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
little kind of Inlet hole where that

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.420 
little kind of Inlet hole where that
hides<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.409> that's<00:05:45.409> really<00:05:45.650> cool<00:05:45.889> i<00:05:45.919> like<00:05:46.219> that

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
hides and that's really cool i like that

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.029 
hides and that's really cool i like that
because<00:05:46.870> what<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.960> means<00:05:47.990> is<00:05:48.440> i<00:05:48.590> can<00:05:48.800> use<00:05:49.009> this

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
because what it means is i can use this

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.659 
because what it means is i can use this
for<00:05:49.490> other<00:05:49.729> devices<00:05:50.000> or<00:05:50.750> maybe<00:05:50.990> a<00:05:51.080> bluetooth

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
for other devices or maybe a bluetooth

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.529 
for other devices or maybe a bluetooth
unit<00:05:52.669> if<00:05:52.849> i<00:05:53.029> wanted<00:05:53.389> to<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:55.400> charge<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:56.000> also

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
unit if i wanted to to charge it also

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.959 
unit if i wanted to to charge it also
since<00:05:56.779> the<00:05:56.870> wire<00:05:57.139> kind<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.529> comes<00:05:57.770> out<00:05:58.009> so

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
since the wire kind of comes out so

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.279 
since the wire kind of comes out so
we're<00:05:59.509> going<00:05:59.599> to<00:05:59.690> go<00:05:59.779> ahead<00:05:59.810> and<00:05:59.960> plug<00:06:00.139> the

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
we're going to go ahead and plug the

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.830 
we're going to go ahead and plug the
device<00:06:00.409> in<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:02.080> i<00:06:03.080> think<00:06:03.469> we<00:06:03.560> got<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:03.770> into<00:06:04.840> the

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
device in and i think we got it into the

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.930 
device in and i think we got it into the
proper<00:06:06.229> mount<00:06:06.440> see<00:06:07.009> if<00:06:07.129> i<00:06:07.250> need<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.430> push<00:06:07.759> the

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
proper mount see if i need to push the
