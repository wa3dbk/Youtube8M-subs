you can see a little indentation in the
bottom<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> switch<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.949> that's<00:00:41.250> where

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

you'll put in like your pry tool there
and<00:00:44.670> pop<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.330> in<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.750> it'll<00:00:46.290> just<00:00:46.320> kind

said<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> my<00:01:26.640> car<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:27.060> tight<00:01:27.690> so<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
said on my car is very tight so kind of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
said on my car is very tight so kind of
gonna<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> pain<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.330> in

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gonna be kind of a pain to get back in

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
gonna be kind of a pain to get back in
but<00:01:30.840> obviously<00:01:31.649> it'll<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.860> doable<00:01:32.130> since<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but obviously it'll be doable since you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
but obviously it'll be doable since you
know<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> made<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.170> yeah<00:01:35.119> okay<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know it's made that way so yeah okay so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
know it's made that way so yeah okay so
here<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> switches

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
here you can see the I got the switches

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.090 
here you can see the I got the switches
out<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> screw<00:01:39.539> behind<00:01:39.810> each<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.229> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
out and it's a screw behind each one so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
out and it's a screw behind each one so
you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:41.880> somewhat<00:01:42.539> longer

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you know you don't need somewhat longer

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
you know you don't need somewhat longer
of<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> screwdriver<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.799> tricky<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of a screwdriver it's a little tricky to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.100 
of a screwdriver it's a little tricky to
get<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.330> because<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.690> switches<00:01:46.080> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
get in there because of the switches and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:56.230 
get in there because of the switches and
stuff<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.310> obviously<00:01:47.909> tough<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> doable

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.220 

okay<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.660> see<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> point

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
okay and then you can see at this point

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.520 
okay and then you can see at this point
I<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.010> black<00:01:59.850> shroud<00:02:00.150> out<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:01.290> there

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I got the black shroud out here there

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.930 
I got the black shroud out here there
was<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.490> screws<00:02:02.790> up

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
was just you know the two screws up

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.970 
was just you know the two screws up
there<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.300> then<00:02:03.450> behind<00:02:04.170> each<00:02:04.470> switch<00:02:04.740> there

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
there and then behind each switch there

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.580 
there and then behind each switch there
there<00:02:05.160> was<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> Phillips<00:02:05.820> screw<00:02:06.060> also<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.470> then

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
there was a Phillips screw also and then

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.590 
there was a Phillips screw also and then
now<00:02:07.710> I'm<00:02:07.920> gonna<00:02:08.040> do<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.460> pull<00:02:08.700> off<00:02:08.880> plot<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
now I'm gonna do is pull off plot the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.110 
now I'm gonna do is pull off plot the
cluster<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.410> two<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.610> top<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
cluster it looks like two up top and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
cluster it looks like two up top and
then<00:02:12.240> two<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> bottom<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.050> should<00:02:13.200> just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
then two on the bottom and I should just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:22.020 
then two on the bottom and I should just
pull<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:13.890> let's<00:02:14.400> see

okay you can see I'm trying to get the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.430 
okay you can see I'm trying to get the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
cluster out right now but there are some

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.780 
cluster out right now but there are some
plugs<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.099> way<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:28.549> gonna<00:02:28.640> have

plugs here in the way so I'm gonna have
to<00:02:28.879> unplug<00:02:29.209> those<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:29.870> there's<00:02:30.140> one<00:02:30.379> two<00:02:30.769> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
to unplug those so there's one two and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.610 
to unplug those so there's one two and
then<00:02:31.159> a<00:02:31.250> third<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:31.610> back<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.500> only

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
then a third one back there the only

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.170 
then a third one back there the only
plug<00:02:33.890> into<00:02:34.069> one<00:02:34.280> spot<00:02:34.519> they're<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:34.819> separate

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
plug into one spot they're all separate

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180 
plug into one spot they're all separate
sizes<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.720> no<00:02:35.959> need<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.409> label<00:02:36.950> them<00:02:37.069> or

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sizes so no need really to label them or

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.530 
sizes so no need really to label them or
anything<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:37.700> those<00:02:37.940> will<00:02:38.150> have<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.329> come<00:02:38.510> out

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
anything but those will have to come out

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.920 
anything but those will have to come out
pull<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.200> cluster<00:02:39.500> completely<00:02:39.890> out<00:02:40.629> okay<00:02:41.629> so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
pull the cluster completely out okay so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.800 
pull the cluster completely out okay so
here's<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> cluster<00:02:42.799> out<00:02:43.329> it<00:02:44.329> was<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.659> little

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
here's the cluster out it was a little

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.690 
here's the cluster out it was a little
bit<00:02:45.079> difficult<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.829> pop<00:02:46.010> out<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.370> looks<00:02:46.640> like

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
bit difficult to pop out it looks like

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.130 
bit difficult to pop out it looks like
now<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.239> see<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.720> could<00:02:47.870> have<00:02:47.900> popped

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
now that I see it I could have popped

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.720 
now that I see it I could have popped
off<00:02:48.319> these<00:02:48.470> two<00:02:48.500> little<00:02:48.890> metal<00:02:49.040> brackets<00:02:49.549> here

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
off these two little metal brackets here

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.550 
off these two little metal brackets here
what<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> made<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.720> easier<00:02:51.019> for<00:02:51.079> pulling<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
what it made it easier for pulling it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.319 
what it made it easier for pulling it
out<00:02:51.650> lighter<00:02:52.069> just<00:02:52.220> held<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.730> one<00:02:53.030> little

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
out lighter just held on with one little

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.630 
out lighter just held on with one little
screw<00:02:53.569> there<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.920> yeah<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.069> had<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> kind<00:02:55.549> of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
screw there but yeah I had to kind of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.089 
screw there but yeah I had to kind of
wiggle<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:57.200> was<00:02:57.410> wasn't<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:57.950> hard

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
wiggle it out it was wasn't that hard

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.530 
wiggle it out it was wasn't that hard
but<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.700> know<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:59.120> would<00:02:59.359> have<00:02:59.450> been

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
but you know it would have been

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.699 
but you know it would have been
definitely<00:02:59.660> easier<00:03:00.049> if<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.349> pop<00:03:00.530> those

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
definitely easier if I just pop those

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.319 
definitely easier if I just pop those
now<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.069> may<00:03:01.220> pop<00:03:01.430> those<00:03:01.640> off<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.090> put<00:03:02.239> it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
now so I may pop those off to put it

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.720 
now so I may pop those off to put it
back<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.690> yeah<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:03.769> see<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.099> clusters

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
back in yeah you can see the clusters

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.309 
back in yeah you can see the clusters
out<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.180> now<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.359> can<00:03:05.569> do<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.049> know<00:03:06.140> whatever

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
out so now you can do you know whatever

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.470 
out so now you can do you know whatever
you're<00:03:06.530> going<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.680> be<00:03:06.739> doing<00:03:06.970> putting<00:03:07.970> gauges

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you're going to be doing putting gauges

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.059 
you're going to be doing putting gauges
or<00:03:08.750> put<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.170> different<00:03:09.409> cluster<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.920> you

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
or put in a different cluster and you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:18.280 
or put in a different cluster and you
know<00:03:10.190> whatever

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.539 

okay<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.799> gotta<00:03:20.040> go<00:03:20.159> and<00:03:20.280> had<00:03:20.459> to

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
okay so you know you gotta go and had to

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.520 
okay so you know you gotta go and had to
put<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.760> back<00:03:20.879> together<00:03:21.060> um<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.989> reason<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.319> did

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
put it back together um the reason I did

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
put it back together um the reason I did
this<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.859> because<00:03:23.120> my<00:03:24.120> ABS<00:03:24.390> hasn't<00:03:24.719> worked

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
this just because my ABS hasn't worked

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.209 
this just because my ABS hasn't worked
since<00:03:24.959> I've<00:03:25.140> had<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.439> car<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.920> don't<00:03:25.980> like

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.219 
since I've had the car and I don't like

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.039 
since I've had the car and I don't like
the<00:03:26.400> light<00:03:26.549> being<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.879> so<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.150> popped<00:03:27.780> out<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the light being on so I popped out the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.559 
the light being on so I popped out the
little<00:03:28.230> bulb<00:03:28.409> that's<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.799> there<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.129> that<00:03:29.569> but

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
little bulb that's in there for that but

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.970 
little bulb that's in there for that but
yeah<00:03:30.719> I<00:03:30.780> mean<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.260> lot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.650> people<00:03:31.829> pull

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
yeah I mean you can lot of people pull

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.160 
yeah I mean you can lot of people pull
these<00:03:32.099> four<00:03:32.340> gauges<00:03:32.640> four<00:03:33.299> times<00:03:33.569> up<00:03:33.959> back

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
these four gauges four times up back

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.449 
these four gauges four times up back
back<00:03:34.769> facing<00:03:35.219> gauges<00:03:36.200> different<00:03:37.200> things

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
back facing gauges different things

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.649 
back facing gauges different things
ideally<00:03:38.459> would<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.700> liked<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.939> fix<00:03:39.209> mine<00:03:39.389> has

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
ideally would have liked to fix mine has

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.190 
ideally would have liked to fix mine has
got<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.959> scratch<00:03:40.290> there<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:42.049> wasn't<00:03:43.049> able

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
got the scratch there but I wasn't able

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.780 
got the scratch there but I wasn't able
to<00:03:43.290> finally<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> had<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> reasonable<00:03:44.250> price<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
to finally I had a reasonable price so I

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.750 
to finally I had a reasonable price so I
just<00:03:45.180> got<00:03:45.329> rid<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.629> ABS<00:03:46.579> warning<00:03:47.579> light

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
just got rid of the ABS warning light

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.520 
just got rid of the ABS warning light
just<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.389> was<00:03:48.480> annoying<00:03:48.689> and<00:03:49.230> I've

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
just because it was annoying and I've

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.979 
just because it was annoying and I've
never<00:03:49.650> had<00:03:49.859> ABS<00:03:50.189> on<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.400> car<00:03:50.669> since<00:03:50.849> its<00:03:51.060> setup

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
never had ABS on the car since its setup
