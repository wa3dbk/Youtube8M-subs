students sitting next to you has to say

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
students sitting next to you has to say
another<00:01:13.560> sentence<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> trick<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> he

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
another sentence now the trick is he

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.920 
another sentence now the trick is he
must<00:01:15.720> use<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.320> word<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.369> wrote<00:01:17.720> here<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
must use the word that he wrote here in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.859 
must use the word that he wrote here in
his<00:01:19.320> sentence<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.670> example<00:01:21.090> he<00:01:21.240> wrote<00:01:21.270> cat

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
his sentence so for example he wrote cat

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.520 
his sentence so for example he wrote cat
right<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.310> start<00:01:23.610> something<00:01:23.970> like

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
right so you would start something like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
right so you would start something like
let's<00:01:25.530> say<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> don't<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> woke<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
let's say I don't know I woke up in the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
let's say I don't know I woke up in the
morning<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> he<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.619> say<00:01:29.040> something<00:01:29.369> like

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
morning and he would say something like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.440 
morning and he would say something like
I<00:01:29.880> fed<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.750> cat<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.350> brushed<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.070> teeth<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I fed my cat and brushed my teeth so and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960 
I fed my cat and brushed my teeth so and
so<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.530> said<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.040> fed<00:01:35.490> my<00:01:35.640> cat<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so on so if you said I fed my cat and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
so on so if you said I fed my cat and
brushed<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.450> teeth<00:01:36.509> obviously<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:37.950> know

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
brushed my teeth obviously we don't know

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
brushed my teeth obviously we don't know
for<00:01:38.640> sure<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.119> word<00:01:39.509> he<00:01:40.229> used<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
for sure which word he used right to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.280 
for sure which word he used right to
make<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> sentence<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.079> could<00:01:43.259> be

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
make a sentence with so it could be

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.050 
make a sentence with so it could be
brushed<00:01:43.740> it'll<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> teeth<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.820> anything

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
brushed it'll be teeth could be anything

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.380 
brushed it'll be teeth could be anything
so<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.290> guess<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> part<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:47.880> they

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
so that's a guess in part here so they

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.490 
so that's a guess in part here so they
continue<00:01:48.899> doing<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.790> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> meanwhile

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
continue doing this and in the meanwhile

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.200 
continue doing this and in the meanwhile
these<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.860> app<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> opposite<00:01:53.520> team<00:01:53.759> right

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
these the app or the opposite team right

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
these the app or the opposite team right
they<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.630> listening<00:01:54.930> carefully<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
they are listening carefully in a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.819 
they are listening carefully in a
thinking<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:57.149> word<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.869> possibly<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thinking which word they possibly use so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.240 
thinking which word they possibly use so
